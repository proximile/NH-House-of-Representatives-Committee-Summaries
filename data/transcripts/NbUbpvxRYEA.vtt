00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
specifically what i'd appreciate
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.789 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%
okay and can you shrink that a little
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
bit so that we're just seeing the image
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure that i can okay
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
we can scroll all right all right so
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
um the this morning i'd like to start us
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
out by
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i i put exec i i guess technically
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's a different name
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
since we're uh a effectively a
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the whole finance
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
but we'll use uh the the procedures for
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
executing bills
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
um and we'll uh we'll talk about
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
hp 600 and take a vote
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
um then to get oriented to where we are
 
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh in the overall budget process uh mr
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
ripple has put together a sheet
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
that shows uh the adjustments that we've
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
based predominantly on votes that we've
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
already been taken i
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
i think there might be a line item in
 
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
there relative to the a
 
00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
m expectations but generally those are
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
reflecting votes we've taken there's a
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
second sheet that basically shows a
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
summary of all of that
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be have to be
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
updated probably after some votes today
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
we i'd like us to to specifically
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
look at the veterans home um
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
part of the budget the totals and and
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
plan on what what we want to do with
 
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
plan on what what we want to do with
that

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
um for a while i thought representative
 
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.110 align:start position:0%
um for a while i thought representative
rogers

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
rogers
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh was going to have an amendment on
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
section 35
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the a m and so i i printed
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
or i published this before
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh hearing this morning that she does
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
not have an amendment on
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
section 35 but she does have one on 34
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
which is all fine we're going to discuss
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
some sysc house bill twos i don't think
 
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.629 align:start position:0%
some sysc house bill twos i don't think
they're

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
out of ols maybe they'll be out of ols
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll see there are several of
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
them as i understand
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
but we have enough information where i
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
think you can discuss them
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
intelligently uh and then i just wanted
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
to touch base again
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the 11 or the 12 april meeting
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have as a division
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
relative to the new forensic
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
hospital just to make sure we're sharing
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
because it's a little unusual i just
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everyone's on the same
 
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.950 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everyone's on the same
page

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess at that point
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
until 2 30 and as i mentioned
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
before we started the meeting the reason
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
that i picked 230
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
is because um representatives
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
irf and wyler have a county
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
meeting that they need to go to relative
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
to the county budgets
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh and they that they should be back by
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
2 30.
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
also we've got a number of amendments
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
that we've asked
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
ols to produce for us and and
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
they're they're working on them right
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
now so hopefully they'll be done by
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
2 30. we
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
are going to talk about hb 254.
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
there's there's a concept there uh that
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about this afternoon
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
we'll need an hb2 section to have a
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive discussion so that's why
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's after 2 30 and not this morning
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk and hopefully vote
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
on sections
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
26 and uh and 34
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
34 discussion could uh take quite a
 
00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.270 align:start position:0%
34 discussion could uh take quite a
while

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
um that that'll be uh between
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee members uh then um
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
as we looked at the budget and and
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
deeper into the mmis
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
um money that was in the operating
 
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.710 align:start position:0%
um money that was in the operating
budget

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh it seemed like a big chunk of that
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
ought to be moved over to
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
sb excuse me hb2 so we'll talk about
 
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
sb excuse me hb2 so we'll talk about
that

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's a personnel hb2 to discuss
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's a back of the budget hb2 to
 
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.469 align:start position:0%
there's a back of the budget hb2 to
discuss

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
and then we just have some opportunity
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
for discussion and votes
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
if you could go back up mr ripple to
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
where you can we can see the
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
words for the tuesday and wednesday
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
there that's good
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
so uh because it's in the house calendar
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
um i have to start the meeting at 9 30
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
but we'll probably immediately go into
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
recess at two
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
to two o'clock on both days and
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
and we will only meet if we have a
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
reason to meet
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
what could cause us to have a reason to
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
meet well if
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
in our discussions it it seems to be
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
clear that we need ols to do some more
 
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
clear that we need ols to do some more
work

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
we would send the work over today for
 
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
we would send the work over today for
example

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
and and then by two o'clock tomorrow
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
they should have
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
had time to produce any results that
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
we've asked them to
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
and um and i i don't want to be doing
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
this but these
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
are these are typical project management
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
slack days that have been
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
programmed in here just so that we
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely positively know we're going
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
by wednesday the 24th and representative
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
rogers your hand is up
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes um amendment that i have is not to
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
section 34.
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
it says it's a amendment to house bill
 
00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.230 align:start position:0%
it says it's a amendment to house bill
one

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
on the funding um on family planning
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clear that up okay no
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's a good clarification
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
and and representative erf has one of
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
those as well
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
and so so we'll have an opportunity to
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
a couple at least a couple of options
 
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.430 align:start position:0%
a couple at least a couple of options
there

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
so um okay so that's the orientation to
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
are there other questions about the
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so um
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
mr ripple if you could bring up house
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
so it's while we're waiting for that
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
i'll just say
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
that this is one part of
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
why i like zoom you know
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
because if we were all sitting in person
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
in a committee it would be harder
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
for us to to have a way to make sure
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're all looking at the same document
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
time and i was on ways and means and it
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
was just really hard to follow
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
where things were that were being
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
discussed and so i
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
i like this aspect of zoom so so even
 
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.269 align:start position:0%
i like this aspect of zoom so so even
um

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
i hope that we can maintain this zoom
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
component because i think it's a very
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
powerful communication tool
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
so so that free editorial aside
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh we took testimony on
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
hb 600 last week
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
um there was a good discussion i think
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
you you may recall representative marsh
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill and
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
speaking uh at length to it and uh
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
taking questions
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
um there there was a
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that talked also about
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
um by anthem saying that they had not
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
really had an
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be informed of this issue
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that they had a point of view
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
that they were paying for this as a
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
bundled drg
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
or a bundled service and i i um
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
i i can i can appreciate that point of
 
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.069 align:start position:0%
i i can i can appreciate that point of
view

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
but um i think today
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh i'm ready to entertain a motion
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
to uh otp recommend otp
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
sorry before you do that did you want to
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
typically you would vote on the you had
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment to change the effective
 
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.629 align:start position:0%
an amendment to change the effective
date

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
typically you would vote on the
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment first and then on the bill as
 
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
amendment first and then on the bill as
amended

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
oh i thought it was the other way around
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
but but
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
okay i i just remembered it the other
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
way which is not
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
uncommon for me to be totally backwards
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
so so welcome representative weiler
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
um representative bean took a
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
role earlier and uh
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
you look busy there sir are you ready to
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be our clerk or do you want
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
representative bean to continue for a
 
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.629 align:start position:0%
representative bean to continue for a
while

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
just finding the tally sheets give me a
 
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
just finding the tally sheets give me a
sec

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
sec
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay so this was a simple amendment uh
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
to hb600 you may recall some discussion
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
of whether or not
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
60 days was sufficient for the
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
department to
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
implement a change and uh kind of the
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
thing that seemed
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
to probably take the longest in their
 
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.949 align:start position:0%
to probably take the longest in their
administrative

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
changes was that they needed to have
 
00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.389 align:start position:0%
changes was that they needed to have
some

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
code in their system
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
updated and of course when you do that
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
you have to design it you got to
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
update it you gotta test it you gotta
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
verify it and then you gotta cut over
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
and go live with it
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
in person but since we can i
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
i just like it visual information is
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll add a little discussion i i
 
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.270 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll add a little discussion i i
got

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh an email i did an email exchange with
 
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
uh an email i did an email exchange with
ms

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
ms
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
sue dunlap i believe it's dunlap not
 
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.630 align:start position:0%
sue dunlap i believe it's dunlap not
dunlop

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
dunlop
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
but but in any case
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
she said to me
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
that they think
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
anthem for example is paying for these
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
testing services
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh under a bundled service rate
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
and uh i had looked i'd listen to the h
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee hearing and to our own
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
and that point never stuck out to me
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
during testimony
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
maybe the point was made and i just
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
missed it it's a point i don't think i
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
would have missed
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
but to be fair to her and to kind of
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
complete the record
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
i just want people to know that she's
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
she believes
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
that they're paying for it as a bundle
 
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.270 align:start position:0%
that they're paying for it as a bundle
great

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
and that we didn't hear that in
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
testimony so what i told her
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
was two things will happen today
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
this will either fail and and she
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to worry about it or this
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
will pass
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
and she can work with the senate
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
to to get that part of her testimony
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh better understood than than the way i
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
understood it
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
so i i think i think that's fair to her
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
and fair to the insurance companies
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm i intend to vote in favor of
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
otpa on hb600
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
is there any other question any other
 
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.310 align:start position:0%
is there any other question any other
comment

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh not seeing any mr clerk would
 
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.070 align:start position:0%
okay uh not seeing any mr clerk would

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
is the is division three is forwarding
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
this to finance so that
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
finance will uh hold a
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
will finance have to hold another
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
meeting on this or can
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%

we we our division didn't execute we
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%

00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
to execute
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%

overview document that mr ripple has put
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%

a lot of things that we've agreed to and
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
14.5 million this first year
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
and 14.5 million the second year
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
to the county cap line we voted on that
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
seven to nothing uh when we when we
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
looked at the details
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to revisit that i think
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative rogers your hand is up
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through each of these
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
and talk about each of them to the
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
extent people want to talk about them so
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
can this be enlarged i can't read it at
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
all oh
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
kevin kevin is it possible to send this
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
to us in an email so that
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
i can print it off real quick and write
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
some notes on
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
so so let's do that it's 9 53
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
let's take a a sort of a bio break and
 
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
let's take a a sort of a bio break and
an

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
ingestion break so that people can look
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
at this and think about it before we
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
really get into it
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
so so let's uh let's take a mile break
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
until 10 o'clock i have it at 9 53 right
 
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.630 align:start position:0%
until 10 o'clock i have it at 9 53 right
now

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
and then mr ripple while you're sending
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
that would you send the second document
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.840 --> 00:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:24:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.840 --> 00:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.960 --> 00:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:32.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
hmm

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:46.830 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay i think
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
um it's 9 59 but it looks like
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
everyone's ready to go
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
so um miss ripple if you could return to
 
00:27:58.399 --> 00:27:59.430 align:start position:0%
so um miss ripple if you could return to
sharing

00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay and so for those of you that
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
worked with me this weekend you'll note
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
that the date on this version is 322
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
which is today so so some of these
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
are going to require a discussion
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
just just to get get us in sync
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
so uh we just talked about the first
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
line there it's not numbered but it's
 
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.430 align:start position:0%
line there it's not numbered but it's
the

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
14 and a half million dollar a year line
 
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.950 align:start position:0%
14 and a half million dollar a year line
for

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
the county cap and uh
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
i i need to figure out how to
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
see people and see the document
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay so um is there any discussion on
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
this i think
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
i think we we have discussed it and
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
decided on this
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone wanting to revisit it
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's okay so the next one the
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
enhanced f map for development service
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
and child health insurance program
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh this was a 12 million dollars that
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
essentially newfound revenue in the
 
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.110 align:start position:0%
essentially newfound revenue in the
estimate

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
because of the enhanced f map
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
being applied to all components of
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid and not just the main account
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
so so this is this 12 million dollar
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
increase in revenues
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
for us is is uh
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
is is basically just getting the dot of
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
the budget document to reflect
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
reality so this is kind of a correction
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
i think to the budget
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
is there any conversation around the
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap being reflected
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm only able to see like five
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
people at a time in this view so
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren i'm not
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing you i just don't want to
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
accidentally miss you if you're waving
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative waller i just wanted
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
to check kevin is and er
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
and representative edwards is that the
 
00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:15.350 align:start position:0%
and representative edwards is that the
um

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
that's the amount that karen told us
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
for the enhanced uh yes it is and that's
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
the number you did actually
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
vote on that one already last week okay
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
and to be clear that's the number we
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
so i figured out how i can see all of
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
you now by the way so if you just wave
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
all right so eliminate
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
uh sysc a one-time transition
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
costs added to hb2
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
basically this uh removes 12.3 million
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh in fy23 from the department's budget
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh the note about one-time transition
 
00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:13.110 align:start position:0%
uh the note about one-time transition
costs

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
added to hb2 i think if you look
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
down there which could you highlight for
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
us is that the 2.65 million
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
mr ripple down under hb2 adjustments
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
for the transition costs yes okay
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
so don't highlight it right here right
 
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.149 align:start position:0%
so don't highlight it right here right
okay

00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
so so so yes uh
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
the the the documents reflect closing it
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
in the second year but
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
the uh the transition costs are things
 
00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:43.990 align:start position:0%
the uh the transition costs are things
like

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
you know mock-balling buildings
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
retraining people
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh those were in doctor doctor that was
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
on mr
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
joy's uh list uh
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative wallner do you have a
 
00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:57.909 align:start position:0%
representative wallner do you have a
question

00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
i do um i wondered if
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
kevin how are we doing on the amendment
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
syc amendment is it done
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
at this point it's it's it's not done i
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
think i may have received one
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
component there were nine individual
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
components and so i've asked ols to draw
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
them as individual amendments and as one
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
comprehensive amendment because i didn't
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
know which you and representative weiler
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
would want to offer i believe i've
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
received one
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the nine but i haven't had a chance
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
to look at it yet so i'm thinking it'll
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
be this afternoon before we've received
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.430 align:start position:0%
the entire
package

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay so on this section my question
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
would you really want to be taking
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
savings and adding in house bill 2
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
until we have really made our final
 
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.029 align:start position:0%
until we have really made our final
decision

00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
on what we're going to do with that
 
00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.630 align:start position:0%
on what we're going to do with that
amendment

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
i i think you're absolutely dead on
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
there representative wallner
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
and and and what i'm looking at the way
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this document right now
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
is it's it's it's like an 80 90
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
good draft but it's good enough for us
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
to see all in one place
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
the all the issues we've talked about
 
00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
the all the issues we've talked about
and

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
and so uh mr ripple is prepared to
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
update this based on any additional
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
votes and decisions we make today but
 
00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:29.269 align:start position:0%
votes and decisions we make today but
this

00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
the the pain is not dry here
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i i would just i would like to
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
see the amendment on
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
the sununu center before i uh
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
absolutely and so so before i felt
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
really firm on these
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
on these figures and and just just to
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
flash what i think we'll probably end up
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
having to do
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
i i think this issue alone of updating
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
this document
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
is probably reason enough for us to plan
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
on coming back tomorrow afternoon at 2
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
30 just to
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
put the finishing touches on things but
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
but today i'm expecting to get through
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
is that does it is that that's clear
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh so your hand is still up but oh
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
all right so uh let's let's rewind and
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
try that
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
again the uh so we
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
are saying we're shutting down the
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're incurring a 12.3 million dollar
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.310 align:start position:0%
we're incurring a 12.3 million dollar
savings

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
in the second year and we're
 
00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:47.750 align:start position:0%
in the second year and we're
anticipating

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
one-time transition costs of 2.6 million
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the first year
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
in order to facilitate that happening
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative weiler do you do you have
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
any conversations you've had the most
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with mr de joy do you want
 
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:02.710 align:start position:0%
conversations with mr de joy do you want
to

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
speak to this at all no i think
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
i think once we see the uh the separate
 
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.270 align:start position:0%
i think once we see the uh the separate
parts

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
parts
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
that probably we could go over the nine
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
separate parts which kevin has made the
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
trouble of
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
coming in nine separate and then we
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
could if we don't have any problems with
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
any of them i'd like to adopt it as one
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment but when we see it all we'll
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
be looking at
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir yes sir okay so
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
so this is new uh to about half
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
of half of us uh as we were looking and
 
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.470 align:start position:0%
of half of us uh as we were looking and
talking

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
about the mmis line item that's
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget um and listen
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
and thinking about what we heard
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
what it it seems is that
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
the line item that is funding
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
the contractors in hb1
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's for legacy systems
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
to operate while we're phasing in new
 
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.349 align:start position:0%
to operate while we're phasing in new
systems

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and the idea is that these legacy
 
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.710 align:start position:0%
and and the idea is that these legacy
systems

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
should go away and we don't want our
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
to reflect uh a
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
tremendously high artificial rate
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
of having two systems running in
 
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.270 align:start position:0%
of having two systems running in
parallel

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
parallel
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
at the same time so so the legacy
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
systems i think should be reflected
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget because that's
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
our go
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
forward operating plan and and
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
this would move the legacy maintenance
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
costs to hb2
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
under the belief that that's the right
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
way to treat what it effectively is a
 
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
way to treat what it effectively is a
one-time

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
cost the dollar amounts
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are reflect the
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
amount of that mmis budget that was
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
related to writing checks
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
to the contractors that maintain that
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
in an ideal world with perfect
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
accounting information we could just do
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
sort and figure out how much of
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
that money is for the legacy system and
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
how much of it really is going to have
 
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
how much of it really is going to have
to

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
stay in operation after
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
after the phase phase-in of the new
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
system in other words
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
the the 12.4 million probably
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
is a is more of a hybrid than it should
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
be ideally of both
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
legacy costs and ongoing future costs
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
but we don't have the accounting data
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
to show what a better split on that
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
so in talking to kevin and
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr ripple and miss rounds
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh it just seemed like the cleanest
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
thing to do was
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
to just put the whole contractor line in
 
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
to just put the whole contractor line in
there

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
and move it to hb2 um
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
but there are could be easily different
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
points of view are there any
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
so what i'm what i'm not hearing is a
 
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
so what i'm what i'm not hearing is a
basic

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
basic
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
agreement that by moving the contract
 
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:18.790 align:start position:0%
agreement that by moving the contract
line

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
over to hb2 we're treating it as a
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
one-time cost and then
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
due to our lack of visibility in the
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
cost details
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to accept the assumption
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
that that whole line is
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
see i think i'm i think i'm saying
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
people who aren't in i.t should
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
understand and
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that i am because i've
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with i.t people so much so
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
is there any confusion about what i'm
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
saying i i don't want to just assume
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
agreement when there isn't because i i'm
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
not explaining it
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
so so mr weiler or representative weiler
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
just gave me a thumbs up i think
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
i think it's understood so uh we're
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to see an hb2
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
on this this afternoon are we not uh if
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes you will thank you
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
okay so the next line item
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
is um the the governor's budget
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
reflected a pretty significant growth
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
over the current budget in terms of the
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
number of personnel
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
assigned to the department and
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
um and then looking at the vacancies
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh i went through and um
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
anticipated that we could reduce 180
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
of them would that which would still do
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
two things
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
if we had it at 180
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
which was my initial thought on this is
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
that we would have
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
left enough vacancies in the department
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to grow continue to
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
grow some
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
and they could grow with some a little
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
bit of flexibility
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
and that it was a big enough number to
 
00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:21.750 align:start position:0%
and that it was a big enough number to
where

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
everyone who was hired today could get
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
their step
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
increases and promotions and none of
 
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:28.790 align:start position:0%
increases and promotions and none of
them

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
would have their positions at risk so
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
180 was was kind of a in my view
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
a comfortable number for the department
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
growing into albeit at a much slower
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
rate and at a much lower
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
ceiling on the ceiling issue
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem to me to be a big deal
 
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.750 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem to me to be a big deal
because

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
we have workforce shortages everywhere
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
every department is talking about
 
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.790 align:start position:0%
every department is talking about
workforce

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
shortages i have talked to people in
 
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.309 align:start position:0%
shortages i have talked to people in
industry

00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
at hospitals uh everyone is having
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
workforce shortages
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
so so that's another way of me saying
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think the governor's budget
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
on personnel was really realistic
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
because we have such workforce shortages
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
we could carry that head count on the
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
books we could budget for
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
it but because of the workforce shortage
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
we're never going to hire for it anyways
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
so so why not have our budget reflect
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
more reality so that was my thinking on
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
the 180 number
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
so for those who would like to know how
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
i got to 226
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
based on some discussions in the last 24
 
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
based on some discussions in the last 24
hours

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's been a request to
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
to do the absolute most that division
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
three can do
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
to bring the budget to a point where
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh it can be passed 226
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
i think is is that number i haven't
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
i haven't done the math or the science
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
on it but i in my
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
instinct of instincts of 40 years of
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing this stuff
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
226 i think is is kind of the
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
the lowest we can go on the personnel
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
limbo and so
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
i this morning i asked mr ripple to
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
put update the hb2 to reflect 226
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
instead of 180. so so that's new
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
information to you
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative weiler because you and i
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
had talked about 180
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
and now i'm showing you 226 and kind of
 
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:39.670 align:start position:0%
and now i'm showing you 226 and kind of
a

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
public meeting so i apologize for that
 
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.030 align:start position:0%
public meeting so i apologize for that
but

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
under given the time pressures were
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
under i i thought i should
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead and take this opportunity to do
 
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.750 align:start position:0%
go ahead and take this opportunity to do
that

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
let me ask you a question go ahead say
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
you were on mute sir okay um
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
is are we still having something saying
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the back of the budget that you've
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
got to cut more things or is this
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
yes that's the next line that's the next
 
00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:09.990 align:start position:0%
yes that's the next line that's the next
line

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
the two lines work together personal
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
reduction department wide reduction
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
so i think you're referring to the
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
second line
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
all right uh represent representative
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
rogers your hand was up
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
and then representative waller when you
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
cutting a hundred people yeah
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
the department basically said that that
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
was going to
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
going to do a lot to hurt the department
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
226 positions is going to devastate the
 
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.950 align:start position:0%
226 positions is going to devastate the
department

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
you might talk about industry and other
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
departments but here
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about staff that's dealing
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
with our most vulnerable people in the
 
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
with our most vulnerable people in the
state

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with our children
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with our elderly
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with people that have
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
serious developmental problems
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with our most vulnerable
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we're trying desperately to get
 
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.349 align:start position:0%
and we're trying desperately to get
people

00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
into these jobs and now you want to cut
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
more of them
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think that what you're doing between
 
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.710 align:start position:0%
i think that what you're doing between
that

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
and your next item we might as well just
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
shut the doors at health and human
 
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.990 align:start position:0%
shut the doors at health and human
services

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
um i i could never vote for this budget
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
with this in there
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that i can speak for a
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
number of people in our caucus
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
if what you're saying is that you don't
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
want a democratic vote
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
on this budget i think that's what
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to get with this
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
these two items thank you for that i i
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
i would just point out that the
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
department is operating
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
now and that this is leaves them with a
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
head count greater than what they have
 
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
head count greater than what they have
now

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
so it won't be here years if you do
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
i i i know it would make their job
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
more difficult and that they would have
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
to go back to the drawing board and
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
really rethink their priorities for
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
additional head count
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that they may have to go back and
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
take some head count
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
that is currently occupied and move it
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
to something that they consider more
 
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
to something that they consider more
valuable

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh or more value-added like for example
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's 96 people
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
on the staff of the sununu center that
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's 96 people that could be
 
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.309 align:start position:0%
that's 96 people that could be
reprogrammed

00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
reprogrammed
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh to um to fill positions
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
that i think would have more value to
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
the state so so it looks like a big
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
number in isolation but given that it's
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
more than they have now and that they've
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
got the 96
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
um at the sununu center that we're
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
trying to free up
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's not quite as bad you get with
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
the if you subtract the 96 from the
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
from the 226 you're getting pretty close
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
to that 100 i initially
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned so i
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
i i don't expect you to agree with me i
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't expect your vote
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
i i just my job is to be as clear
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
and transparent as i i can be on this
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative waller
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
well i was going to ask the same
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
question when i left here
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
last week i thought that karen had come
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
forth with
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
um a reluctant proposal
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
was definitely reluctant on her part but
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
she was trying to
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh she was trying to
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
be reasonable i thought and she brought
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
in um a hundred
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
a hundred positions the idea of a back
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the budget hundred positions
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
um we've now more this more than doubles
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
doubles that and you know i think that
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
year um the department
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
has really been having to to function
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
and we need to we need to help them
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
get back to where they're functioning um
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
in a non-crisis mode between the
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic and losing
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of employees i'm sure who needed
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
to be home with family
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe some who decided i've got to
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
retire i'm sure there's a whole
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
bunch of reasons why there is a very
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
large vacancy rate right now
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
but i think we need we need to all be
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
working towards helping the department
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
get back to
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
normal where they can um really
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
provide the kind of services that we
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
need in new hampshire so
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm very disappointed to see
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
the the hundred i was worried about the
 
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
the the hundred i was worried about the
hundred

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm more than double worried about
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:47:44.359 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
the um
226.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i i don't have much to
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
different to say than what i just said
 
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:53.910 align:start position:0%
different to say than what i just said
to

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative rogers similar concern i
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
i would just want to reemphasize that
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
given their vacancy rate as of the 11th
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
of march
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
that after imposing this paperwork
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
reduction because it's not a real
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
reduction um
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not a real reduction because
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
due to their vacancy rate
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
they have a a really strong number of
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
people that they could still add to
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
their payroll
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
before they hit this this new threshold
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
so so it's not crippling in the sense
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
that if they just
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
take a time out take a look at what
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
their priorities are
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
they have vacancies that they could move
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
around to priorities
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
and probably be fine and be better off
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
than they were this year
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
certainly and the pandemic will
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
eventually go away and so
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the crisis management will
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
go away and they can go back to
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
methodical uh planning and executing
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
with the higher personnel count that
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
they've had during the pandemic
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i i don't i don't view it as as as
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
bleak has been described
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren thank you very
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
much mr chair
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
um i think for the people listening in
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to explain again and
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
it could be i glazed over because
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
i was astounded at the number but
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
explain again the 226 positions are
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
some of these people already employed at
 
00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:35.190 align:start position:0%
some of these people already employed at
healthcare

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
are these people that would have been
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
new hires
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
in their budget okay
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
so uh if you if you were if we were to
 
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.589 align:start position:0%
so uh if you if you were if we were to
look

00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
at i think that's a fair question but
 
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:49.670 align:start position:0%
at i think that's a fair question but
i'll

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'll get to your your your the main the
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
main thing you're
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
asking i think is if
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
we go forward with this level
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
does this force the department to
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
terminate anyone who's been hired the
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
answer to that is
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
definitively no it would not force them
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
to do that they would
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
still have plenty of room to do that
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
would it force them
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
to forego and or make it difficult for
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
agreed upon step increases or to pay for
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
the personnel benefits
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
no it's all still in there and it's all
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
still in there
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
they had 507 vacancies department-wide
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh as of the 11th of march
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
and and so by
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and then in in
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget was
 
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget was
anticipating

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
growing the head count to 32 26
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
so this 226 cut
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
cut would take them to 3 000
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
department wide well as of the 11th of
 
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.150 align:start position:0%
department wide well as of the 11th of
march

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
department-wide they had 2646 people
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
employed so there's 400 people
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they still need to go find in a
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
situation with workforce shortages
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
and and uh on board them and and
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then and so i think they have
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
room to grow this is this is not
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
the kind of cut that that i took several
 
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:37.829 align:start position:0%
the kind of cut that that i took several
times

00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
in corporate america where
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
where you just had to cut period and
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
and government is protected from the
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
realities of the real world
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
because here we are in an economic
 
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.349 align:start position:0%
because here we are in an economic
crisis

00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
and we're debating how much we should
 
00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.069 align:start position:0%
and we're debating how much we should
grow

00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
grow
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
head count and in my proposal here
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
they're still able to grow head count
 
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.670 align:start position:0%
they're still able to grow head count
considerably

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
considerably
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i think it's probably more than
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
they'll actually be able to
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
um to hire so i
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
i i think it'll be
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
tough and from a management perspective
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
but having to be really careful about
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
what they're doing
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
but i believe that we've hired good
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
enough managers that they can
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
that they're up to the task so
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-on or well i just i
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
just wanted to maybe take
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
issue with the fact that we have an
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
economic crisis
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the ways and
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
means committee
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
is coming up with that came up with more
 
00:52:47.359 --> 00:52:48.150 align:start position:0%
is coming up with that came up with more
money

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the week and i would just
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
what think that needs to be something we
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
discuss soon
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
to see what we're doing with that money
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
um i i think there's still a large
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
number of people that became unemployed
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic that have not gone back
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
for those people were in a crisis
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative waller um yes i just
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add one thing and that
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
is it hasn't been said
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
is um the department
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
as all state government has been under a
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
um it has been lifted now but it was but
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
they were under hiring freeze
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
for probably nine to ten months
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
so their vacancy rate was sort of
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
artificially held down because they were
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
not able to recruit and hire during that
 
00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.030 align:start position:0%
not able to recruit and hire during that
period

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i also want to i'm also concerned
 
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.230 align:start position:0%
and i also want to i'm also concerned
because

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to know how this is going
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
to affect i know that
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital we started the
 
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.829 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital we started the
path

00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
path
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
program remember we moved people over to
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
the philbrook center
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
and so as a transitional housing and
 
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:03.349 align:start position:0%
and so as a transitional housing and
then

00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
used that when those folks were on
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
for children in order to start to
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
address some of those problems in the
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i know that there had to be new
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
staff hired for that
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
so when the governor had more staff
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
hired in his budget probably
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
a part of that was because of making
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
that adjustment and opening up those i
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
20 beds um
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
so i would really i when i see
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
226 positions it really concerns me that
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
um we don't have all the we don't have
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
all the information we need
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
so i i think that's a fair point and and
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
just to uh maybe uh complete it a little
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
i i would point out that uh at the end
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
of fy 19
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
2916 with these
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh reductions in the governor's budget
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
the the new authorizations would be
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
three thousand
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
which is more than two thousand nine
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixteen
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that is not even
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
counting the fact that we have 96
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
head count at sununu that can be
 
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
head count at sununu that can be
reprogrammed

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
reprogrammed
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and and given the vacancy rate takes us
 
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:35.670 align:start position:0%
and and given the vacancy rate takes us
well

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
below what was authorized at the end of
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
fy 19.
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
i think our management at dhhs
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
is good enough to have
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
these flexible resources to apply
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
to the most urgent priorities and i'd
 
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
that if we were in the room with
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
management making management
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
priority decisions i would put the path
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
center very high
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
i certainly put it higher than the
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
so i i it
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
you know we can't do their job for them
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
from here
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
but i think if we give them additional
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
resources over what they have
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh and say you need to prioritize how
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to grow
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
that that's that's not unreasonable
 
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.630 align:start position:0%
that that's that's not unreasonable
particularly

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
given what's happened to so many
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
of our brothers and sisters out in the
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just forgot to lower my hand
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative nordran do you have a
 
00:56:45.359 --> 00:56:46.470 align:start position:0%
representative nordran do you have a
follow-up

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes please um i'm looking at the agenda
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
um that you sent out and i don't see any
 
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.950 align:start position:0%
um that you sent out and i don't see any
place

00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
listed where we're going to talk about
 
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.230 align:start position:0%
listed where we're going to talk about
the

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
new money that ways and means has found
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
and how that fits into our overall
 
00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:06.549 align:start position:0%
and how that fits into our overall
discussion

00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know if representative weiler
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
has any comments on that
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
i thought we should maybe just get that
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
out on the table
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
so we know where we are with that and if
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
it can
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
maybe uh alleviate some of the concerns
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
as we look at the pages i think that's a
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good topic and i think the the
 
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.670 align:start position:0%
it's a good topic and i think the the
next

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
slide that uh kevin's excuse me mr
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
ripple is going to put up
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
that that shows that high level
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
summaries may be a good place for
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative wyler if he once can
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
talk to us about the new and improved
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
ways and means ideas now
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
keep in mind i i think until ways and
 
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:49.910 align:start position:0%
keep in mind i i think until ways and
means

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
gets an update past the house
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
technically i think we're still on the
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
same trajectory that we're supposed to
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
live within the ways and means estimates
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
but but i i will defer to uh
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
wiser souls on that issue
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh i'm so we'll so we'll talk about it
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative norgren but there's a
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
better better moment to do it than this
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
um department-wide reduction with
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
exemption for certain direct services
 
00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.670 align:start position:0%
exemption for certain direct services
areas

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
so the other day i think it was about a
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
week ago
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
when we went through an exercise of
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
reviewing medicaid reviewing chip
 
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.109 align:start position:0%
reviewing medicaid reviewing chip
reviewing

00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
um the developmentally disabled lines
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh the the the direct health care lines
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think uh
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
i think we were unanimous that
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
those direct care lines
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
were things that that that we probably
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
would all
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
support or if not all of us a majority
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
would support i think all of us actually
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
but um so so the way that hb2
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
is being written as i understand it is
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask for a department-wide
 
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask for a department-wide
reduction

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh and that um but we're going to try to
 
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.630 align:start position:0%
uh and that um but we're going to try to
exempt

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
direct care programs
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
so that we're still delivering health
 
00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.270 align:start position:0%
so that we're still delivering health
care

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
to the most needy in our society without
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
restricting them so um so i'll let mr
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
ripple talk a little bit about
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh how that might be worded for the
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
certain direct service areas
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but this is a department-wide um
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
reduction of of 50 million
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
of which i understand most of it
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
if not all of it can come in really good
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
management of the higher lag as they
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
bring people on
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
and the reduced personnel lines from the
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
reductions above so um so mr ripple do
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
you want to say something there or i
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
just i'm inviting you to
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
or here's how it's currently being
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
drafted by
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
ols no reductions
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
shall be made to appropriations in the
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
following areas developmental services
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
including acquired brain disorder
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
services and children's in-home support
 
01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:23.510 align:start position:0%
services and children's in-home support
services

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
the children's health insurance program
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
or county programs including the state
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
share of funding for nursing facilities
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
and other
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
long-term care services so those areas
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
would all be exempted by this back
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
then what about the medicaid lines
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's not being exempted um at least
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
not in this version
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of money in that
 
01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:48.549 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of money in that
line

01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the department spent significantly
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
less than their appropriation in fiscal
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
20. so including that in the carve out
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
my may hinder their ability to meet this
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
kevin have you calculated or have you
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
had the department help you calculate
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
how much federal money we will we we
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
have the potential to lose
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
when we're reducing the um general fund
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
by 50 million dollars over the biennium
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
since most of the most of the um
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
funding in the department uh
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
also receives federal federal money so
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
how much are we really cutting the
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
budget here
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
i haven't calculated that and i haven't
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
received from hhs
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
the amount that would be reduced so they
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to do that
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up could i just ask
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
really be a fairly good
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
estimate aren't most of their programs
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
um a 50-50 match with the federal
 
01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.710 align:start position:0%
um a 50-50 match with the federal
government

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
so that this 50 million really looks
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
more like
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know the 50 50 is the average
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
match rate but they certainly do get a
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds i would have to ask the
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
department for their
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
for their estimate of how much the total
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you kevin thanks i appreciate that
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
so so in theory though they have uh
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
general funds that we invest that don't
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
have federal
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
matching money because we think it's a
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
good thing to invest
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
in so we're spending general funds
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
without federal
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
augmentation but we also have those
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
programs do we not
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's true there are certainly general
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
funded uh programs only
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
it really varies across the department
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
which is why it's difficult to give an
 
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
which is why it's difficult to give an
estimate

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
right and i don't think you could give a
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
really great estimate
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
until we knew what the health what the
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
management team prioritized if they're
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
given a task to reduce general funds and
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
you know two two accounts one that gets
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
federal match and one that doesn't i
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
would think that they're
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
good enough managers to to pick the one
 
01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:19.990 align:start position:0%
good enough managers to to pick the one
where

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
i guess that's a statement and not a
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
um i guess i believe in the management
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
ability of the
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the the commissioner on down good
 
01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.309 align:start position:0%
of the the commissioner on down good
leadership

01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
team this is an opportunity for them to
 
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.630 align:start position:0%
team this is an opportunity for them to
lead

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
lead
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i think that all becomes
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
really complex
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
and you'd really have to have a lot more
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
a lot more information because some of
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
um might be 100
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
general funds and no federal funds might
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
be things that
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
um by law we are obligated to do
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
by by state law we're obligated to do so
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know it seems like i would need
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
a lot more information but
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the department could give us
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
sort of a estimate of
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
how many dollars we lose every time we
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
cut a general fund dollar i mean i'm
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
sure they have
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of an average um
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
so as i understand our role relative to
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
theirs they've been doing this since
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
july and they have been operating in
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
this environment
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
for a lot of their career so when you
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
say that they would
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
that we would need to know a lot more
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
information than we do
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
i i think the managers and leaders of
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
dhhs already know vastly more
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
than our division iii committee can
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
never know because we're not in
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
the operational flow of information
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh i and again as as they set their
 
01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:00.069 align:start position:0%
uh i and again as as they set their
priorities

01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
i would expect them to prioritize those
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
programs that have a statutory
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirement to them
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
that that would that would that would
 
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.910 align:start position:0%
that that would that would that would
exceed

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
the priority of a discretionary program
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
chose to develop and implement on their
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
own so
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
so i i don't doubt that they have a true
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
they would have a tremendous challenge
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
of rethinking
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
what they wanted to do and having them
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
think about what they need to do
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
wanting and needing are two different
 
01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.870 align:start position:0%
wanting and needing are two different
things

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
represent i'm ready to go to
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative weiler unless you have a
 
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.670 align:start position:0%
representative weiler unless you have a
follow-up

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
oh i my own my only follow-up is that
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
um i i really feel like it is
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm well aware of back of the
 
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.789 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm well aware of back of the
budget

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
reductions i i understand how they work
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually have been a part of having
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
budgets that
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
in the end had to have back of the
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
budget reductions but
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we've given the
 
01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:04.230 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we've given the
department

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
any guidance in how we as the
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
legislature we're here to speak
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
for we're here to speak for the
 
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.349 align:start position:0%
for we're here to speak for the
legislature

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
how the legislature would like to see
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
some of these reductions made
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's our role i think
 
01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:21.910 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's our role i think
that

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
we should have gone through more
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
carefully the budget and decided that
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
there were things that we didn't think
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
um needed to be done and
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
given the department some guidance i
 
01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
given the department some guidance i
know

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm very disappointed to see
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
that what you're basically
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
doing is just back of the budget
 
01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:49.750 align:start position:0%
doing is just back of the budget
reductions

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we haven't given the department no
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
guidance as to what
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
it is we would like i i personally
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
don't have a suggestion of what how we
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
would find 50 million dollars
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
in general funds but um obviously
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
um other members of the committee do
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and just to
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
clarify a a point where we agree
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
i i think i think we agree that we
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
should give them some guidance
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
and i think hb2 as we exempt certain
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
direct service areas
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of our guidance
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
and because there are set of federal and
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
state laws
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
on the books that they have to comply
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
with that's a lot of their guidance
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
so so i i would i would say
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
while i completely agree with you that
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
we need to give them legislative
 
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.430 align:start position:0%
we need to give them legislative
guidance

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
i i would i would just add that i think
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
they have a tremendous amount of
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
guidance to work with
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative representative weiler
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i think we're spending too
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
much time on this because we've
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
been doing it for years we've had back
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the budget cuts
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
for this agency as long as i can
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
remember we've done it on this agency
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
more than any other
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
because they are so big and so complex
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
and they overlap and so
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
in so many areas that we've we've
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
quite often done this and then they are
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to come back to fiscal
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
and they can reorganize and move things
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
around move dollars around move people
 
01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
around move dollars around move people
around

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i think a budget maybe the last
 
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.309 align:start position:0%
and i think a budget maybe the last
budget

01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
we had them coming back with we gave
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
them a total number that they could were
 
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.430 align:start position:0%
them a total number that they could were
allowed

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
and then when they had that were fun
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
were approved but not funded they could
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
move someone from
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
retirement or resignation or
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
reorganization they could move someone
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
from the slot that was eliminated
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
to a slot that was still there and that
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
worked we never heard any problems about
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
they had to stop
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
functioning or couldn't do some
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
particular thing
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
huge agency we've done this before and
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
this is nothing new i wish we wouldn't
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
so is there any more commentary
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the section called hb1 back of the
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
budget sections there are two personnel
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
and department-wide
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh let's talk about
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
some hb2 adjustments we have removed
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
section 37 this was
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
1.5 million that i think we voted on
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
last friday
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
where we just removed it and this is a
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
reflection of removing it this was the
 
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
reflection of removing it this was the
program

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
that that had about 800 and
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
some odd potential uh
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
applicants and no procedures for who to
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
make eligible so um so we
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
we dropped that is there any comment on
 
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
we dropped that is there any comment on
that

01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
remove section 38
 
01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.470 align:start position:0%
remove section 38
[Music]

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
we did vote on this we took the 200 000
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
out of of hb2 because
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh this seemed to be the opposite of the
 
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.830 align:start position:0%
uh this seemed to be the opposite of the
mmis

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
mmis
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
that this was really ongoing operations
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
that should have been in the operating
 
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.630 align:start position:0%
that should have been in the operating
budget

01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
so we removed it from hb2 because it
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to belong there
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
and as we talked about it and moved it
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's when we found out that it would
 
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.630 align:start position:0%
that's when we found out that it would
also

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide a six hundred thousand dollar
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
federal match
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
um so are there any comments or
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any that add the mmis
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
contract costs this is the
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
inverse of what we talked about up in
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay i don't know so we've discussed
 
01:10:55.199 --> 01:10:56.070 align:start position:0%
okay i don't know so we've discussed
that

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
so the one-time sununu youth center
 
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.709 align:start position:0%
so the one-time sununu youth center
money

01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh to help them close down
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that 2.65 million uh we discussed
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
that when we were talking about the hb1
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
appropriations but
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
is there any more comment on that
 
01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
is there any more comment on that
representative

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.709 align:start position:0%
representative
wallner

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
i just wondered are we have we're not
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
doing we're not carrying
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
any money into the into 23.
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
we we just think we
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
or is the 2.65
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
is it not is that la non-lapsing
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler you've had lead
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
on this area what
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
could would you respond yeah it wouldn't
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't last till the end of the
 
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:48.950 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't last till the end of the
biennium

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
so if if the program slides into 2023
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
the money's still available
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not so concerned i mean the program
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
would prob would end but i'm consider
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about um
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
just things like mothballing the
 
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
just things like mothballing the
building

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
the training of staff all those kinds of
 
01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.149 align:start position:0%
the training of staff all those kinds of
things

01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't necessarily be able to
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
have all of that really completed by
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
june 30th
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
so i want to just be sure that they can
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
carry that money over into the next
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
next year to use that for for that
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
well perhaps we could footnote that
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
particular one so
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that happens okay
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple would you would you take
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
a note
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
to just make sure that that 2.65 million
 
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.510 align:start position:0%
to just make sure that that 2.65 million
in

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
2022 is non-lapsing so it can be
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
invested through the 23 fiscal year
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
i will and i believe that those
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate there are four separate
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
appropriations in the house
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill 2 language for sununu center
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
transition costs totaling the 2.65 and i
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
believe they're all for the
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the total buying for the whole
 
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.870 align:start position:0%
for the total buying for the whole
biennium

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay so reducing funding in section 35
 
01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.030 align:start position:0%
okay so reducing funding in section 35
by

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
removing alvarez and marcel dd
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
redesign costs if you remember
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
there they we looked at five line items
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
and i i think there was a unanimous
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
belief that lines one through four made
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
sense because we had
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
little investment and great savings
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
and then where where we got hung up
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
and unable to move forward was uh
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
on what to do with the dd line item
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i think uh representatives rogers
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
and earth talked
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh a couple three times this weekend and
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and apparently were unable to
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
to reach a resolution so so this
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
reduced funding is the payback
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
from the investments i think it's the
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
net of the investments
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh with the paybacks involved
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
for lines one through four so so
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
can we clarify that uh first mr ripple
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
that this is just one through four
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
sorry the cost of the first four items
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
for the table that the department put
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
together last week
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
was 3.3 million dollars so the
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
amendment will contain an appropriation
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
of 3.3 million dollars so this is
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
roughly 6.7 million less than
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
is the net the 6 million minus the 3
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
million in investment for a 3 million
 
01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:53.510 align:start position:0%
million in investment for a 3 million
net

01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
net
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
no this what you say the savings shown
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
here of 6.7 million
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
from the original 10 million 43 000
 
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.750 align:start position:0%
from the original 10 million 43 000
appropriation

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
down to the new 3.3 million dollar
 
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
down to the new 3.3 million dollar
program

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay so where did oh it's down below
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
i just said okay i got it
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
so so this line is we're removing
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
line five we're not investing in line
 
01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:22.870 align:start position:0%
line five we're not investing in line
fives

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
fives
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
this shows the removal of line five
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
correct and then the net is shown in the
 
01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:30.630 align:start position:0%
correct and then the net is shown in the
other

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
those are four million and six point two
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
million because those are the savings we
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
expect to receive
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the monies that we're investing in
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
lines one through four
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
that's right all right thank you so
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
so hopefully everyone understands what
 
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
those two lines how they work together
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes i i'm really concerned that we
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
taken out from this proposal
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
the the dd redesign um
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
the 38 people we haven't really left the
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
department anything we took
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
off to keep working on
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
um the redesign for the dd
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
and what i what the part of it that
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
really concerns me is learning that
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
there are 38
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
people that developmentally disabled
 
01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:29.830 align:start position:0%
people that developmentally disabled
folks

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
that we are providing services for
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
and paying for services in florida
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding is from the department
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
that those services are costing between
 
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.790 align:start position:0%
that those services are costing between
250

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
250
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
and 500 000 per person
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and besides it costing a lot
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
the downside to me is that they're away
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
from their families
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems like we need to be moving
 
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
and it seems like we need to be moving
towards

01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
getting those folks back to new
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire where they
 
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:05.090 align:start position:0%
have family and have a support system
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:06.229 align:start position:0%
have family and have a support system
[Music]

01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
this just seemed this seems like a
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
very poor decision
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
to to not provide any funding to move
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
forward with a plan to try to bring
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
those folks back i think it would
 
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.910 align:start position:0%
those folks back i think it would
probably

01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me it would probably have um
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
been the largest savings in the end over
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
the next several years
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have some sort of a
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
network here in new hampshire for those
 
01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.390 align:start position:0%
network here in new hampshire for those
folks

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
there may be more people that we're
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
sending out of state and very expensive
 
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
sending out of state and very expensive
placements

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
placements
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm very disappointed that we did not
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
with some funding in that line to allow
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
the department to continue the planning
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
for trying to build a system that can
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
care for people here in new hampshire
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
and not sending them out of state
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's that's uh that's a
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
summary of your view point thank you i
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
from my
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
my viewpoint what has happened here is
 
01:18:13.679 --> 01:18:14.790 align:start position:0%
my viewpoint what has happened here is
that

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the a m report came very late in the
 
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.709 align:start position:0%
the the a m report came very late in the
process

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
the department had it two weeks before
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
they shared it with us
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
when the a m people came in here they
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
gave us uh
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know a decent summary and and in our
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we were able to get some
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
anecdotal data points
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
about the impact of the program
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
um but what we have not gotten is we
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
sort of a comprehensive project view
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
where we've had a chance to challenge
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
some of the assumptions like for example
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh in it's my understanding that all
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
the group homes that we have developed
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
organically within the community
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
and that the state funding is just a
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
small piece of the total amount of
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
revenue they need to operate the group
 
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
revenue they need to operate the group
homes

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
they rely on a tremendous amount of
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
charitable work that comes from the
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
community that has embraced them and
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
built them
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
and grew them and that rather than using
 
01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:15.830 align:start position:0%
and grew them and that rather than using
that

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
tried and true method of kind of organic
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
development of group homes this
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
is a proposal to do a top-down driven
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
set of projects and if and if those fail
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the community
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
charitable support
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
then the estimates of how much the state
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
would need to invest
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
are understated and then if we
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
end up paying more fully for those new
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
four group homes then what's going to
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
happen is the other 12 or so group homes
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the state i forget the exact number
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it's nine
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
but those that have been relying heavily
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
on charitable donations they'll go this
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
isn't fair
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
those four people are getting more state
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
money than we are we need our state
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
money too
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
and so there's actually a potential
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
hidden bill here that nobody is seeing
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
and looking at
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
because we haven't evaluated this as a
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
total program
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
this this feels like a really good thing
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
for all of the reasons you just
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned but
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's not right i don't think from an
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
investment decision
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so i would encourage the department
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
to really work
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
on putting this together in a more
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
programmatic view and
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking it to the senate where the senate
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of their process can
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
become begin to evaluate this
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
rather than what happened to us where we
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to even look at it until
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
we were almost done
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think it was fair to us
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
to be put in the position to have to
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
make a multi-million dollar decision
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
affecting all of these people and then
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
have it look like we don't care
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
because they didn't give us the time and
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
the program documents that we should
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
have had
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
that if the department thinks this is a
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like it is that they have
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
to go work it out with the senate in a
 
01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.030 align:start position:0%
to go work it out with the senate in a
comprehensive

01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
programmatic view that looks at the
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
long-term risks
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
associated with the project we didn't
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do that
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
so your hand your hand is up i apologize
 
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.270 align:start position:0%
so your hand your hand is up i apologize
for

01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh is there any further question on this
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none um
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
there there there will be a discussion
 
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.270 align:start position:0%
there there there will be a discussion
to

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
this afternoon on section 34 the
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
financial implications of that that we
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
have not talked about this morning that
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
will end up going into this
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's version but i know
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative rogers has
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
some input in that and i've known for a
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
longer time that mister
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
or excuse me representative earth does
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
so there's this is not complete but it's
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty darn complete
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh next next slide please
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
so do you want to walk us through this
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
sure this one is pretty simple it's
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
simply the governor's
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh recommended appropriation totals in
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 1
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
compared with the proposal that you just
 
01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.990 align:start position:0%
compared with the proposal that you just
saw

01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
saw
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
so actually i'll go back to the other
 
01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.510 align:start position:0%
so actually i'll go back to the other
document

01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
quickly because of these four
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
items the only ones that you'll see
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the house build one totals for hhs
 
01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.229 align:start position:0%
in the house build one totals for hhs
are

01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
these right here showing 9.9 million
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
reduction in fiscal 22 and a 10.8
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
million reductions fiscal 23.
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
so if we then go back over here you'll
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
see that general fund reduction
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
in 22 and that general fund reduction in
 
01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.310 align:start position:0%
in 22 and that general fund reduction in
23

01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
and there's an associated loss of
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds here which is mainly
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
the removal of mmis and the movement of
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
that appropriation to house bill 2. so
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
as you can see from the note here
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
federal funds are dropping by 32.9
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
million and 22 and 34.8 million
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
in 23 but those federal funds will be
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
authorized by the house bill to
 
01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
authorized by the house bill to
appropriation

01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
so so am i right to hear you say that it
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
while it looks like a loss on this
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
in reality it's not a loss because the
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh given that this is an hb2 can approve
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
and receive those
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
that same amount of federal funds later
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
that's true and actually the way the
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 and i
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
the way the house bill 2 language is
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
being drafted the department wouldn't
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
even need to go to fiscal to accept
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
so this this is just a sheet that
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect reality but it's the
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
sheet that reflects
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
the format and methodology we use at
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
this stage
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
right representative walner
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes kevin could you tie back
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the first page the total additions
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
reductions to the budget as introduced
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay to this
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
to this page that we are
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
looking at sure the only thing
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
so you'll see here the general fund
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
reduction in 22 of 9.9 million
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes that is the same as
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
this figure right here so the second
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
page really only relates to
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
the first part of this page the hb1
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
appropriations section
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
got it got it so it doesn't relate to
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
reductions correct because those won't
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
be reflected in the appropriations
 
01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.110 align:start position:0%
be reflected in the appropriations
totals

01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
totals
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay so this is this this uh
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
page that we're looking at here is sort
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
of artificially low
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
because it isn't the full picture the
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
the reductions are artificially low yes
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you it really isn't a very helpful
 
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.390 align:start position:0%
thank you it really isn't a very helpful
piece

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
piece
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
um you need to look at the whole picture
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
not just not just
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
so the other piece that we could talk
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
about here if you're
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
if you're ready to uh representative
 
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.629 align:start position:0%
if you're ready to uh representative
weiler

01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
we already knew that the governor's
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
budget was based on
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
an fy 22
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
77 or something 77 no it was the
 
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
77 or something 77 no it was the
biennium

01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
the biennium uh the governor's budget
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
was 77 million higher than
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
ways and means ways and means has now
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
come back
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
and informally said that they think
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
it could actually end up being higher
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
now we've not voted on that as a house
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
so we're still on the trajectory
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
from last ways and means but but just so
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
that we can anticipate and plan
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
what what can you tell us about
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
um discussing it with some of the other
 
01:26:44.159 --> 01:26:44.950 align:start position:0%
um discussing it with some of the other
divisions

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
this money that has been added
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
there's places where they took away
 
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
money that was expected to go
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities they took away revenue
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
sharing they took away state aid grants
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
and they took away the increase in the
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
delivery to the towns of cities so
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
it would seem like there were more
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
reductions in those areas than there
 
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
reductions in those areas than there
were

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
in what the governor sent us on hhs i
 
01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.229 align:start position:0%
in what the governor sent us on hhs i
anticipated

01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
he'd have more reductions in hhs because
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the huge growth it had in 21
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
but he didn't most of his reductions
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
were in other areas so if
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
if more funds are available it seems
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
like that's where they should be
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
put and also there's there's uh
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
several people that want a speed up on
 
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.270 align:start position:0%
several people that want a speed up on
the

01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
tax cuts but looking at head discussions
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
ways and means and where some people
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted the
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax to go away in
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
two years rather than five
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
but that would have taken 170 or 180
 
01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:57.990 align:start position:0%
but that would have taken 170 or 180
million

01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
to do that and we didn't have that much
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
more money
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
and money that we did have would seem to
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate going to the towns
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
and cities and the programs that had
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
been suspended
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
because that some of those towns had
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
come to to uh
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
rely on that money especially if you're
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
building a water treatment plant a
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
sewage treatment plant and you're
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
expecting some state aid grants and some
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
other distributions like that and all of
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
a sudden boom they're gone
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's more of a shock than anything
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
that happened in hhs
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
and if you're anticipating a better
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
distribution of meals and rooms tax to
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
go into your town budget
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
and boom that's gone that would seem
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
like that was a hole that had more
 
01:28:38.159 --> 01:28:39.270 align:start position:0%
like that was a hole that had more
priority

01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
than putting more money back in hhs
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
especially when they already are at a
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
point where they can't grow to the money
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
that was given them
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
so that would be a more help to more
 
01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:53.430 align:start position:0%
so that would be a more help to more
people

01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
that was that was the way we tentatively
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
decided we haven't worked it all out yet
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative waller you have
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes my question is for uh chairman
 
01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.030 align:start position:0%
yes my question is for uh chairman
weiler

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so i think on friday you told us
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
it was an additional 127 million is that
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
is that about right okay
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
and you're saying it's
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
it looks like you're looking at putting
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
it into revenue sharing
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
and the rooms and meals tax it goes back
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
to communities is that correct
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct and is that the whole
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
i mean you're going to put the whole 127
 
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.350 align:start position:0%
i mean you're going to put the whole 127
million

01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
into those two programs those are just
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
some of the ones we discussed
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
we haven't uh discussed much with
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
division two
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
what they thought as a need because they
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to talk to karen
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
but lynn and i and jess were talking
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
about some of these other things
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that's where we felt the need that
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
we had seen cuts
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
um that people on money people were
 
01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.550 align:start position:0%
um that people on money people were
expecting

01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
expecting
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
so better talk with karen about what she
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
might see in hp2 but she hasn't done
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
much in the way of cutting in hp2 there
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
might be more money going into education
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to talk about that
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay that was my actually that's what
 
01:30:16.239 --> 01:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
okay that was my actually that's what
was

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
going through my heads are you not i
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
mean are we
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
not seeing any of this 127 million
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
dollars going into education which goes
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
directly to our communities
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think i think there will be but at
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
this point we haven't
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
looked at all the figures and i've got
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
to get together i haven't had the time
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
to get together with the other divisions
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
and say okay if you had more money where
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
would it go but
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh karen and i haven't had a chance to
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
meet but i haven't met with flynn
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
and those were her big things that you
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
know here's his programs that people
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
were anticipating boom were taken away
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
from them so you gotta
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
pay attention to those and i haven't
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
talked with karen about any programs she
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
had that
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
that might have happened and i think
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
some of that would be an education on
 
01:30:57.679 --> 01:30:58.149 align:start position:0%
some of that would be an education on
her

01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
budget so just one follow-up so
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
for division one and division two you
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate them
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
having at least some part of 127 million
 
01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.830 align:start position:0%
having at least some part of 127 million
dollars

01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
to use for to
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
avoid i guess avoid uh reductions in
 
01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:18.870 align:start position:0%
avoid i guess avoid uh reductions in
their

01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
their budgets but none of that 127
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
million is coming to health and human
 
01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.629 align:start position:0%
million is coming to health and human
services

01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
if we collectively decide that
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
we need more in a certain area then
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly that will be in the
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so i have a couple questions
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
for you sir
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
i want to understand 127 million number
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
is is that 127 million
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
on in addition to what ways and means
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
had been projecting
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
and if so then they had a 77 million
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
dollar hole to begin with relative
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
to the governor does this now just put
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
us 50 million ahead of the governor's
 
01:32:02.159 --> 01:32:03.990 align:start position:0%
us 50 million ahead of the governor's
budget

01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's what i'm thinking but i
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
haven't had that clearly explained
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
by uh ways and means but that's my
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
impression that it only gives you
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
an additional 50. thank you sir and then
 
01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.070 align:start position:0%
an additional 50. thank you sir and then
the

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
second question would be um i
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's not in our division but i had heard
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
that there were
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
some critical water and sewage
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
investments that are also direct public
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
health investments
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
that isn't in our budget but as a
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
as a public health advocate i i would
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
want these sewage and water
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
projects to compete favorably
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree on that
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
do you have any clue how much that is
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
those would be
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
in i i don't want to that one
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
um no i didn't look at the cut my
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
recollection is from previous budgets
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
these run around
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
30 million a year something in that area
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir uh
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative norgren you had your hand
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
up and then representative wallner
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i'm a little worried that
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know a whole lot more from
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
about what money might come to division
 
01:33:24.719 --> 01:33:25.669 align:start position:0%
about what money might come to division
three

01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
when it appears that um you're planning
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
to vote on the budget today
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
in division three so it seems like we've
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
got a chicken and an egg
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
situation i was wondering
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
how we can somehow get some
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
more clear direction from the chair
 
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:48.709 align:start position:0%
more clear direction from the chair
about

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
what money we might have for division
 
01:33:50.719 --> 01:33:52.470 align:start position:0%
what money we might have for division
three

01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a good follow-up let
 
01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:55.669 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a good follow-up let
me

01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
let me say what i think is true
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then representative weiler please be
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to correct me
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh i i think what uh
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
what we are supposed to do per
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's statute or just the rules
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
of how we do the budget
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
is that the budget that we pass as a
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
and send to the house for a vote must be
 
01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.709 align:start position:0%
and send to the house for a vote must be
predicated

01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
predicated
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
on the ways and means revenue number
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we received
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
a month or two ago when we were in
 
01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
a month or two ago when we were in
session

01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that uh we're we're not allowed at
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
to do anything with the enhanced
 
01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
to do anything with the enhanced
revenues

01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't been passed by the
 
01:34:41.199 --> 01:34:42.310 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't been passed by the
house

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
and so it's not a chicken or egg thing
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's a sequential thing
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
it starts with the ways and means
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
then we spend it and then
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
we take our our budget to
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
the house and when we're at the house
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
ways and means may come back and say
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh we have another vote to take on
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
higher revenues
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that we would take that vote and
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
and and at that point we have a budget
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's below
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
the new ways and means estimate but but
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's the official process as i
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
what we might do is pass the budget that
 
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
what we might do is pass the budget that
complies

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
complies
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
with the revenue estimates adopted by
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
the house because that's what we're
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
required to do
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
and at the same time we could have
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
contingency things
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
so that if at the point they
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
pass in this next sessions we'll have
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
if they pass things that are um
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
reflective of this extra 50 some million
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
then at that point
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
we can we can come forward and say okay
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
now that the money has been accepted by
 
01:35:59.199 --> 01:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
now that the money has been accepted by
the

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
by the uh full body then here are the
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
contingency things that we'd like to add
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll have those ready to go forward
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
as an amendment so
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's what i foresee as happening but
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
until we have
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
an official uh appreciation by the house
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the new
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
new revenue i don't think we can do
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
anything but try to
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
to meet that first estimate we were
 
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
to meet that first estimate we were
given

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
so uh chairman weiler
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
for are we doing this on wednesday the
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
seventh is that
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
is the budget on the floor on wednesday
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think i had a schedule for the sixth
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
the budget's on the floor of the house
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
on the sixth okay right i i think the
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
six was the budget briefing but the
 
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:56.629 align:start position:0%
six was the budget briefing but the
house

01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're correct that i'm gonna brief the
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
budget on the six we'll all we'll i'll
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
be there all the divisions briefing the
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
budget on the sixth
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then we probably will vote on the
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
seventh but there's the three days there
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know when the
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh speaker will have it it may go
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
by you know alphabetically by committee
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
so we may get to it maybe get to it on
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
the eighth
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay so if we're doing the briefing on
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
the sixth
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
are we doing that we're doing that in
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
bedford at the sports plaza
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
right yes yeah on the sixth
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay so the soonest we could have the
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
budget on the floor would be
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
the eighth is that correct because you
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
have to have two days
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's what the rules say i'm
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
trying to remember that one
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
explosion that sounds familiar with what
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
got said in this division earlier
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i haven't thought about i've
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
never thought about it for two years so
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
just it seems like you had to do it two
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
days before you could vote on the budget
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
but thank you for that recollection
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
you're looking
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're in charge now you look it up i i
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
just trying to remember
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
um okay so that would be the eighth
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
so you're thinking that on like
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the seventh or
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
the morning of early morning of the
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
eighth or something like that
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
we would hear ways and means bring in
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
this these new revenue
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
estimates that's your thought and then
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
we would add to the budget you're
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for your help i'm going to gel in
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
my mind a little better yes
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to help no
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
no well it's been it's been a while
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
since i was chair of finance it's been
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
more recent
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
but yes i think that that'll be the way
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
it'll work thanks for those hints
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
so does that mean we need to recommend
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the speaker that he special order
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
the ways and means estimate to the first
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
order of business on the 7th
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
which sure makes sense or early on the
 
01:39:08.719 --> 01:39:10.310 align:start position:0%
which sure makes sense or early on the
8th

01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
8th
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
well if we have it on the seventh we
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
just have more time to think
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and and because then we have to
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
prepare our own amendment based on that
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
don't we i mean so we need ols
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes well i think we can almost
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate it being accepted
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
we can almost anticipate what we would
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
like to do
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
with the extra money so we'll have those
 
01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.189 align:start position:0%
with the extra money so we'll have those
prepared

01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up representative
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
well i guess i would just mention that
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
have made have been told that they're
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to be in the sports arena on the
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
7th 8th and 9th
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
and now we're adding the 6th and
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
um i really think that
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
that that kind of thing needs to be we
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
need to let
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
all of our colleagues in the house know
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
what's going to be expected
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
of them so thank you
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get it i'll stop helping
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'll stop helping
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
all right are there any other comments
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
or questions
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh let's go back mr ripple to the image
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the work plan for the day that was in
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
that email
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm referring to
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's 11 12 i think we've got another
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
hour let's see how we're going to invest
 
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.430 align:start position:0%
hour let's see how we're going to invest
it

01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
i think we can talk about um
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
review of the veterans home and plan can
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
you can you just
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
show that and uh and by the hand plan
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
what i meant by that
 
01:41:04.639 --> 01:41:08.470 align:start position:0%
what i meant by that
was

01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
just what we think we want to do with
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
the veterans zone
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
because we've been talking about the
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
can you bring up the just the bottom
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
line of the veterans home the budget
 
01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.310 align:start position:0%
line of the veterans home the budget
view

01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm referring to the bottom line
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay so um we've we've seen this we've
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
been briefed on it
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh the commandant went through the
 
01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.030 align:start position:0%
uh the commandant went through the
details

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is true isn't it mr ripple that that
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
personnel reduction
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
does not affect this line item
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct so what
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
what you see is what you get relative to
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh what uh i understand
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have any amendments on this do
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
you from anyone
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i i had never sensed any
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
willingness or desire on the part of
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
anyone to
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease this part of the
 
01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.750 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease this part of the
budget

01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and i had asked for you know feedback
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh last week and didn't get any on this
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
except i may have seen something that
 
01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:02.550 align:start position:0%
except i may have seen something that
suggested

01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
um that the that the blue team
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
is in favor of supporting the veterans
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
home governor's
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
proposal so
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
do we need a motion or
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
i i i would like to get us past this
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
point in saying
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
i you know i'm prepared to accept the
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
governor's budget here
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think you could make a motion to
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
accept the governor's proposed budget
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
for the veterans home and that would be
 
01:43:30.159 --> 01:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
for the veterans home and that would be
sufficient

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative i would move that we
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
accept the governor's budget
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're having a hard time hearing you is
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
the seconded by representative wyler
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anyone's hands raised
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
so um i think we're ready to call a roll
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
a motion to accept uh what's what would
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
i use for the number on this
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
is this an au kevin
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
there are multiple accounting units i
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
think it's sufficient to just say
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
the proposed budget for the veterans

home and that'll encompass everything
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so that's the motion
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.149 align:start position:0%

uh motion in a second and
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
call the roll on how you vote
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%

01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative weiler votes yes
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%

01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um all right with that
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
done we can move on to where it says uh
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
our topic was going to be hb2
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
section 35 a m but because
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
of the discussion that we had
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
during the line item review i
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that we've completed this task
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that wants to have a
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
second bite at the apple of talking
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
about where we ended up with the
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh that would take us to
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
discussion of the sysc
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
hb2s and uh i think earlier we discussed
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be nine amendments
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we may be able to review today and
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
that will do it this afternoon
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
so so i propose that we uh
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
we defer that conversation until we can
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
just have the conversation based on
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
actual amendments
 
01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
is there any disagreement anyone want to
 
01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:14.070 align:start position:0%
is there any disagreement anyone want to
talk

01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any and then on the
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
april 12th meeting this was for
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh the section of hb2 that we removed
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
from hb2 on an earlier vote and that we
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh have a meeting on the 12th of april
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
to get more information
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
i've drafted a potential amendment
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
gotten some feedback on it
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to make sure that
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
folks understood
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm actively waiting for you to
 
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.149 align:start position:0%
that i'm actively waiting for you to
submit

01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
language to me to add to it or to
 
01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.149 align:start position:0%
language to me to add to it or to
replace

01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
replace
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
lines so i'm in a weight mode
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
for input also i wanted to make it
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
clear that similar to what we did on the
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
16th of march where we had an afternoon
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
that we invited people in
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
this this is kind of that same thing
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
so like if representative rogers wanted
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
to invite
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
the water and sewer people from concord
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'd love to hear from them um or
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
or anybody wanted to bring anyone in to
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
talk about this like
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
is 25 the right number for beds or 60
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
the right number for beds who would we
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
invite to have that conversation with
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
representative walter your hand is up
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean you said something about if
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
we wanted to add language or subtract
 
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.709 align:start position:0%
we wanted to add language or subtract
language

01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't i mean this is basically
 
01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:53.189 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't i mean this is basically
an

01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
information session for us to get
 
01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
information session for us to get
information

01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
and until i i mean i would really like
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
to hear from people before i start
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
um doing any other kind of um
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to to the language that you
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
put out there
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure how we will use that
 
01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:13.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure how we will use that
language

01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's a very reasonable position and no
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that and you just gave me feedback
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
so so thank you you were unintentionally
 
01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.669 align:start position:0%
so so thank you you were unintentionally
helpful

01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
oh darn and and
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
but representative rogers specifically
 
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
called out a couple
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
areas that she wanted a tighter rewrite
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
and so i'm i'm i'm kind of hoping she'll
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
just send me some language and i'll cut
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
and paste it
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
and that's that's me just trying to get
 
01:48:42.719 --> 01:48:43.669 align:start position:0%
and that's that's me just trying to get
ready

01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
before the meeting it's not to
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
foreshadow or predetermine the results
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
but but that's kind of my way of getting
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
um representative rogers you think you
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
might send me a couple of sentences
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
um what i'm going to do is ask the mayor
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
to look at it and
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
ask the city to give me what language
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
they'd be comfortable with
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am good idea great approach
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
all right so are there any other
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
what we're trying yes sir uh mr uh i
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't know why i keep calling him
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative weiler um
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
we probably want to hear from the uh
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
corrections as well as the hhs
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
of behavioral health and how they would
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
adapt to all this because it's
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's i'm not sure what percentage of the
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit would be moved
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
corrections department over to mental
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
health some of them will still remain
 
01:49:45.599 --> 01:49:46.149 align:start position:0%
health some of them will still remain
but

01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
it may affect their uh their staffing
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
we want to hear about that yes sir since
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
those are state
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
agencies um mr ripple can you extend
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
those invitations to them
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
and what i'm looking for for the
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee is the kind of the
 
01:50:01.679 --> 01:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
committee is the kind of the
non-traditional

01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
non-traditional
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
non-state players
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay so this afternoon is
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
is a busy day still by itself
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll start at 2 30
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh and i uh anticipate going into recess
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
here in
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
just a minute until 2 30. uh
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
you're handling yes i'm sorry i missed
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
the timing on
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
on the 12th are we doing that in the
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon or the morning
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
i believe it's on it's ready to go to
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
the calendar what did we do for the
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
calendar 9
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
i don't remember okay so we'll we'll
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
find out over lunch
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
okay i i think i'm like 90 sure it went
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
if there's any way it could be afternoon
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate that but
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
well the reason i'm so sure that it was
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the at 9 30 is because i recall mr
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
ripple saying that in the long
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
long-range calendar
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
he's asked to be in the senate in the
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon that oh
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay that's what we're doing that's fine
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
we need mr ripple for sure i think so
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative nordgren and then
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%

clarification

01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
from um chairweiler
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
i think the question came up that if we
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
were executing as a full
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee on friday it wasn't in the
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
calendar so is it going to be in the new
 
01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.350 align:start position:0%
calendar so is it going to be in the new
calendar

01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
or yes we when
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
when we make sure that division two
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
division one of finished i think
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
division one has assured me i'm still up
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
to get to hold the karen
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
and uh i would be able to get it in
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh wednesday and it would still that
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
calendar would begin with friday
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
so it would be in a calendar that would
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
come out thursday
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things uh for the
 
01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.430 align:start position:0%

morning
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
agenda so this afternoon we're going to
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
start by talking about 254
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
in section 26 section 34.
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
there's actually kind of two parts to
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
that hb there's uh
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
the hb amendments that have been uh
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
offered and then there's also
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
a discussion of the family planning hb1
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh budget area that we'll we'll talk
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
about both representative irf and
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh have have some prepared thoughts i'm
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what we'll see but
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
but we they they can certainly speak and
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
show what they they've got
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh and then we'll discuss them to see if
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
there's any natural overlap
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
and and decide what to do hb
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
2 um is just is that
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
hb2 available the mmis moving into hb2
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
that amendment ready yes
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would be it's a house bill one
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
amendment but yes that one is ready
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay and then the hb2 of
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget the the 50
 
01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:01.910 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget the the 50
million

01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
biennium cut is that that's also
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's also an hb one i haven't gotten
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
that one back yet
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe you'll get it by then but
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
if we don't have them both uh on so that
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
we can kind of look at them
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
really kind of together um i i think uh
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll end up pushing those till
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow i think it's uh
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
unavoidable for us to get together at
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh get together tomorrow uh
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
at 2 p.m but but we'll see
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
and then uh it's not on what mr ripple
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
is showing
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
but um over lunch
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh we got a request to
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
consider a cfi footnote
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
that nobody has seen yet other than
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative wallner myself
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
i think representative irf may have had
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
a chance to glance at it
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that and then we'll
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
we'll see where we're at
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
are there any questions about what we're
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
not seeing any would you bring up
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
the hb2 on 254
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
share it the so by that
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
which document i mean the hb2 where
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
we took um the incarceration standards
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
of 254 and we put it into an hb2
 
01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
of 254 and we put it into an hb2
language

01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
well you haven't yet put that in and i
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think i've gotten that amendment
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
back yet
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
i think that's one of the ones i'm
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
hitting on that that happened
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
if i've not given you and i've i've
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
miscommunicated and dropped the ball
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
but um but the idea was
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
um and then it's still subject for the
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee to discuss
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
but the but the idea was that we would
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
take the meat
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the h hp 254
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
new incarceration standards put them
 
01:58:09.119 --> 01:58:09.750 align:start position:0%
new incarceration standards put them
into

01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
hb2 language consider it in
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 as an ad and then
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
then the possibility remain that we
 
01:58:19.599 --> 01:58:20.550 align:start position:0%
then the possibility remain that we
would

01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
vote to retain h.b 254
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
in case we needed to do more work on it
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
over the fall
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay right and that is the text of house
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill 254
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
is one of the amendments that i sent to
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
ols as part of the sununu center package
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
but it's one of the ones that i haven't
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
gone back
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
okay so um okay good
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
um so let's skip over that because i
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
don't think we can
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
go into 254 without that hb to
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh to discuss um hp
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
section 26 do you do you have that
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
sheet where we're showing progress on
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
can i offer an update yes sir
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead all right discussions over the
 
01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:22.550 align:start position:0%
go ahead all right discussions over the
break

01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
break
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
with the uh leadership
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
and dates so now they don't want me to
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
do the final exact session this friday
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be in the calendar for
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
four days so they want my
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
final our final exact session to be on
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
the 30th next tuesday
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's next week
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then so the 30th for the exact
 
01:59:49.119 --> 01:59:50.149 align:start position:0%
and then so the 30th for the exact
session

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
then on the for the
 
01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
joint commission or for the the
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
briefing to the house that will be on
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
the fifth because as
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative walnut pointed out to us
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
you have to have two days from the time
 
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
you brief the
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
budget until we vote on it so we will
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
brief it on the fifth uh that will be
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
probably a
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting not a meeting in the uh
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
athletic center so on the fifth it won't
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
be a meeting in the athletic center
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
or the six it won't be a meeting in the
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
athletic center it will be a zoom
 
02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:23.669 align:start position:0%
athletic center it will be a zoom
session

02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
some of us will be sitting in the house
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
chamber and doing a briefing from there
 
02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.149 align:start position:0%
chamber and doing a briefing from there
to

02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the legislature that chooses
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
to zoom
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
and as i pointed out to them we are
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
restricted at this point by law i would
 
02:00:37.119 --> 02:00:37.750 align:start position:0%
restricted at this point by law i would
say

02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
that we cannot come out with a budget
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
that is higher than
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the original estimates we were
 
02:00:44.639 --> 02:00:45.270 align:start position:0%
the uh the original estimates we were
assigned

02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
by the house ways and means even though
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
they've given us a recent update
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
but what we'll probably do we'll give a
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
we'll give a briefing based upon
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
the budget that we have to do by law
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go in on the seventh the
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
first thing will probably be a new
 
02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.030 align:start position:0%
first thing will probably be a new
estimate

02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then i think we will be ready got
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
enough days to work on this
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
to have a contingency plan okay there's
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
a budget we gave you now we have an
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
extra i think 50 million
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
here's the plan to spend it and so we
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
would bring that up then
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
after they have updated the uh the
 
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:22.470 align:start position:0%
after they have updated the uh the
income

02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue so i think that's the only
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
way we can do it i think that's what i
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
explained to leadership
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll present one budget and we'll do
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
a contingency budget on the seventh
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh thanks representative rogers
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative rogers raise your hand um
 
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
which budget will be presented in the
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
calendar and given to people then
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
the one that we're going to give them
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
first that's according to law or the
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
real budget
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
the one according to law so when will
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
they see the real budget
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
that day on the floor or well i i can't
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
think of any other way because
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
here's here's here's the numbers you
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
were given here's the numbers you've got
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
to produce a budget to
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
brief on the budget until we have an
 
02:02:11.199 --> 02:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
brief on the budget until we have an
update

02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
update
 
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
officially accepted by the legislature
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do to present
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
um an additional spending
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh plan until we have the additional
 
02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:24.709 align:start position:0%
uh plan until we have the additional
revenue

02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
accepted and presented presented and
 
02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:28.390 align:start position:0%
accepted and presented presented and
accepted

02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
so but knowing that i think i will ask
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
the lba when they print up the document
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
that will go out
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
on the screen that here's the rumor
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
if it happens here's the contingency
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
that will be added in
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
so they should probably get it ahead of
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
time then because i was just thinking
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay what do you think of that that
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
would work better because i think
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise people are going to be so
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
confused that yeah
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
why do why do you brief us on this
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
budget then you're talking at the
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
seventh about
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
the budget so yeah i could think of
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
doing it and put language in there
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
to that effect okay thank you by law
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
what i'm require what we are required to
 
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.070 align:start position:0%
what i'm require what we are required to
present

02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
but we expect to hear this because we've
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
been lifted
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
a few days in advance by ways and means
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
if that is presented accepted then
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
it'll be the new numbers and i'll try to
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
explain that in that handout thank you
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for all you people that have
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
had experience with this in that past
 
02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative nordgren i think would
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
like to ask you a question sir
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair both chairs
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
um so i i think in
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
discussions i've had with other people
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
i've wondered
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
if the fact that
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
those numbers have to be presented
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
before we can present our budget
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
is that in an rsa or is that
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
in house rules or where do we see that
 
02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.589 align:start position:0%
in house rules or where do we see that
document

02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
that that's what we have to do the
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
process is the process
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
written someplace or any document when
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
we can see tell you the truth it's what
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
i remembered from the dozen budgets you
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i have seen
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
i don't remember going back into the
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
laws and reading it it's just what i
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
recall from
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
all the past budgets that this is the
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
number you gotta you've got a budget to
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
and you know and in all those cases i
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't think we ever had a revised
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
figure that we could work from so
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
but but we don't know if it's
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
a a rule that the
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
house has established or that it's an
 
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.910 align:start position:0%
house has established or that it's an
rrsa

02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
rrsa
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
when i start working on the handout
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
that'll go out on the fifth i will
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
research it and reference the rsas or
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
the rules whichever
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
one i come up with thank you so it will
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
be published so we'll all see it
 
02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:05.589 align:start position:0%
be published so we'll all see it
thank

02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
all you uh any further discussion around
 
02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:10.149 align:start position:0%
all you uh any further discussion around
that

02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and and i think i also heard you say
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
that there will probably be a a
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
special order to have the ways and means
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
update the
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
revenue numbers like the first day of
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
the for the first moment of the first
 
02:05:24.639 --> 02:05:25.430 align:start position:0%
the for the first moment of the first
day

02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
correct and probably right
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
that we can go forward with what we
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
would have warned them on the fifth
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
may happen if that all comes to bear
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
we should in theory be ready for some
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
floor amendments that might be
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
so um did you have another question
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative norgren yes thank you um
 
02:05:53.199 --> 02:05:54.550 align:start position:0%
representative norgren yes thank you um
obviously

02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
um the democrats will be briefing our
 
02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:58.870 align:start position:0%
um the democrats will be briefing our
caucus

02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
on the budget so i assume the
 
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
republicans will be briefing
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
their caucus on the budget so we can
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
blame to each caucus the process is that
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
what you anticipate yeah i hope i hope
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
we all can explain the same
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
process and that uh everybody will see
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
it in the handout on the fifth and the
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
briefing on the fifth
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
and you know and then i'll also have it
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
as i said that
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
you and i remember there's always a
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
handout that goes out to people and
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be showing it on the screen and
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
maybe putting it up
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
on a website that here's what we plan to
 
02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
on a website that here's what we plan to
do

02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
here's what we have to do here's what we
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
plan to do we expect to
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
see a revised revenue so
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully like you say make sure
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
everybody sees it and has it written
 
02:06:44.239 --> 02:06:45.270 align:start position:0%
everybody sees it and has it written
down

02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
and we don't don't say what the hell are
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
you people doing
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
sorry hopefully it'll all work out if
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
you've got any more ideas of
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
what i can do to make sure everybody
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
knows what the
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
process is let me know okay thanks a lot
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay i'm not seeing any other
 
02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:04.229 align:start position:0%
thank you okay i'm not seeing any other
questions

02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
so i think we can uh start with the
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
agenda for the afternoon which is um
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
we okay we just skipped over 254 but can
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
you bring up
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 section 26 so we can see it
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
did you want to start with that or did
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
you want to start with the document
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
showing the
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
status of house bill 2 sections the
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
second thing you just said
 
02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:34.310 align:start position:0%
second thing you just said
okay

02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
this is one of the last hb2s that we
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
have to discuss
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment now to look at
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't we
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
you do and it would simply
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
actually hold on one second i think i
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
brought up the wrong one
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
but yes you do have an amendment and i
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
notice white space on section 35
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't have any notes on that so
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
that is the appropriation for the
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
alvarez and mars
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations we have an amendment
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
ready for that too let me just pull up
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
section 26 here
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
you think we're going to be able to talk
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
about the amendment to section 35 this
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
afternoon if so i'll add it to my notes
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
so this in the governor's recommended
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
trailer bill
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
hhs's special transfer authority would
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
have been extended until
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
july first 2023 and this would extend it
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
instead to the end of the biennium
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the section 26 that that was
 
02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:57.750 align:start position:0%
in the section 26 that that was
introduced

02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
had uh january 1 2023
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
right yes yes okay and
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
which which member sponsored this
 
02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.350 align:start position:0%
which which member sponsored this
amendment

02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
can we scroll up a little there he is
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
so just to tell you all my name is on
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
there because of protocol
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
i i actually don't support this
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendment i i don't know why
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
we would replace our judgment with the
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
governors the governor
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
office made a very specific decision
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
that january 1
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
2023 was uh
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
the right date and uh instead of
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
listening to the governor who is the
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
chief executive for
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
were listening to the department and i i
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's a chain of command and that i i
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
would tend to respect
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
so but but um i i
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
got the sense from the committee that
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
this is what you want and so um
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
so if there's an amendment to or
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
a motion to accept this um
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
amendment we we can go ahead and discuss
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
it and vote it out
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
don't move for a second
 
02:10:20.639 --> 02:10:23.910 align:start position:0%
don't move for a second

motion and a second to adopt this
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%

so next up is uh
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
hb2 section 34 um
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
and there's uh there's uh
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
two two amendments to section 34 that
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
and before we discuss that i i do want
 
02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.109 align:start position:0%
and before we discuss that i i do want
to

02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
um talk about uh all of the email that
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
we received and
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i received a lot of email
 
02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
i suppose
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
the rest of us have as well
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
and you know i i think the email that we
 
02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:32.229 align:start position:0%
and you know i i think the email that we
received

02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
by and large is uh consistent with the
 
02:12:35.119 --> 02:12:35.589 align:start position:0%
by and large is uh consistent with the
whole

02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
idea of being transparent uh and open to
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
i mean the fact that we got so much
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
email would suggest
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
there was some level of transparency um
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
but there was one email i in particular
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
read to the committee and to talk to the
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
public about for just a moment
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
um because in the last couple of years
 
02:12:57.599 --> 02:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
um because in the last couple of years
um

02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is our society and our politics
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
have been increasingly coarsened
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and we are acting less and less
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
as civilized as we should so this one
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
email i won't read who sent it
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
um writes i and 60 of new hampshire
 
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:17.910 align:start position:0%
um writes i and 60 of new hampshire
residents

02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
oppose your anti-abortion gag rule you
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
had to resort to dirty tricks
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
because for every woman you stand in
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
front of house
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
reps i can bring in a hundred and that's
 
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
no joke
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
i will get your names and addresses and
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
i will mobilize these women to protest
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
outside of your homes if need be
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
these will be peaceful protests but
 
02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:42.550 align:start position:0%
these will be peaceful protests but
relentless

02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
relentless
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
your lack of integrity is appalling and
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
you should be ashamed
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the end of the email
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
um the united states and new hampshire
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh is a nation in a state where the rule
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
of law
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
matters and we have
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
behaved as volunteer legislators
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
in accordance with that rule of law
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
there was a bill introduced
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
there was a valid amendment
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
offered we
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
heard the amendment we took testimony
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've received
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
email we've thought about it
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
our role is to
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
receive the amendment and do what we've
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
done listen to testimony
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
discuss it vote on it
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
the resorting to what
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
comes very close to an anarchist threat
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
violating the sense of security of our
 
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.310 align:start position:0%
violating the sense of security of our
families

02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
is too far and i would ask the person
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
who wrote that
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
or anyone who'd be tempted to write like
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
that to remember that we do this as
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
volunteers because we have a sense of
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
civic duty
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
and civic pride and that sort of threat
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
is just wholly inappropriate to our
 
02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:09.109 align:start position:0%
is just wholly inappropriate to our
process

02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what i have to say about that
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
so um mr ripple if you could
 
02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
bring up the original section 34 and
 
02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
bring up the original section 34 and
then

02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
be prepared to bring up the leon
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and then
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm sure everyone's had a chance
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
to look at this but
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
i did i just did want to call
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
recall have everyone recall that the
 
02:15:55.679 --> 02:15:56.870 align:start position:0%
recall have everyone recall that the
original

02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
original
 
02:15:59.060 --> 02:15:59.070 align:start position:0%
section 34
 
02:15:59.070 --> 02:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
section 34
[Music]

02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
requires us to comply with title 19 of
 
02:16:06.550 --> 02:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
the social security act
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
and with that let's look at
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
okay so it's all too big to fit onto one
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
page but
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
i i think uh i think we've all read it
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
um oh there we go all right
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
so we received a tremendous amount of
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
feedback on this
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
um the there was
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of reference to opposing a gag
 
02:17:02.469 --> 02:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
rule um i i don't know if that's a
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
pejorative or
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
a historically accurate term but but
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's been referred to as a gag rule
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
and then there was a testimony from the
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
hospital association that
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
put a burden on hospitals that provide
 
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.429 align:start position:0%
put a burden on hospitals that provide
abortions

02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
so um i think
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
history the gag rule expression came up
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
in the 1830s
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
when congress prohibited itself from
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
history indicated that the gag rule was
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
not a good thing
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay so this is an amendment
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
that um i think represents
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
the essence of what the leon amendment
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to do i think the key
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
element of this is that
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
family planning programs that receive
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
family planning money from the state
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
be physically and financially segregated
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
from reproductive health facilities
 
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that term loosely is defined in
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
statute to
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
what is the equivalent of a
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
free-standing independent
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
abortion clinic so um
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
so this is requesting that um
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
anyone providing family planning would
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
be physically segregated from abortion
 
02:19:02.479 --> 02:19:04.549 align:start position:0%
be physically segregated from abortion
providers

02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh it deletes
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions on counseling and
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
involved in this legislation so
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
um i think this is a better amendment
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's sufficient uh i i
 
02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.469 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's sufficient uh i i
think

02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think maybe what we ought to do for a
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
few minutes is to try to talk about
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
these two things
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
and uh and get a sense of uh where
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
people are at in terms of
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
um these these two choices
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um first of all um
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think we all got the emails that you
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
talked about and it was no one that i
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
had ever heard of before
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
and um i think that um from someone that
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
gets these kind of emails quite often
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
um i too am alarmed by getting emails
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
like that and so i appreciate what you
 
02:20:05.359 --> 02:20:06.309 align:start position:0%
like that and so i appreciate what you
said

02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and i do appreciate you attempting to
 
02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:09.670 align:start position:0%
um and i do appreciate you attempting to
um

02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
come up with a compromise amendment here
 
02:20:12.399 --> 02:20:13.429 align:start position:0%
come up with a compromise amendment here
however

02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
the physical separation is something
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's quite impossible to comply with
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
by a number of the health centers we're
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
these health centers are not um in any
 
02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
these health centers are not um in any
way

02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
um rich i guess is the first word that
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
comes to my mind
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're not not blessed with a large
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
amount of money they live day to day
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
quite often
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
the money federal monies that they've
 
02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
had to do without in the past couple of
 
02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:41.349 align:start position:0%
had to do without in the past couple of
years

02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
has been quite difficult for them one of
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
the amendments you'll see later that i'm
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
bringing in talks about that funding and
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
how to deal with it when we force the
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
health centers to
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
um to basically redesign their buildings
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
maybe even build separate buildings
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
so they can offer people the ability to
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
obtain an abortion
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
um and i understand that some people
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to have that that ability
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
there that's understood
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
people have disagreements but by this
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
amendment what you're doing is
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
is forcing these facilities to um
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
either stop accepting any kind of money
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
for the other services they do which is
 
02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:19.910 align:start position:0%
for the other services they do which is
providing

02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
health care to a larger number of people
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
of state
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
or to stop offering abortions which is
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
something that a lot of people
 
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
do need to have in the state for
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that may be
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're making it basically totally
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to comply with this
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
and you're forcing them to redesign
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
their entire health center
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i've got to remind you that these
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
health centers
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
provide services to the state that are
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
that are very important
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
in fact in during the pandemic time in
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year fiscal year 2020
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%

testing

02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
testing
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
in the program that health and human
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
services offered was completed by these
 
02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:04.630 align:start position:0%
services offered was completed by these
providers

02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i know you served on health and
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
human services before coming to finance
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
so you're well aware that those two
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
diseases and stds in general
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
are in an epidemic proportion in the
 
02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.469 align:start position:0%
are in an epidemic proportion in the
state

02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%

02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%

breast exams
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
are done by these providers our
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
low-income women
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
um go to these providers for their
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
health care
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have other places to go so by
 
02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.030 align:start position:0%
they don't have other places to go so by
forcing

02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
forcing
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
all of these centers to make a decision
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
basically what you're doing is telling
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
them that
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
either abortions will not be available
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
or that they have to stop serving the
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
clientele that they serve
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that's really an impossible decision
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's a sophie's choice
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
where many of our legislators are what
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
you would call
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
pro-life or anti-choice and many of us
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
are what you would call pro-choice or
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
they would say anti-life
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's a split down the middle on this
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't think the finance
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee should be in a position of
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
saying whether the legislature is
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
either anti-choice or anti-life or
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
whatever label we want to put on it
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
the language that's been in here for a
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
number of years is probably equally
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable for both sides
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
but it's a compromise that's been
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
reached and we've all learned to live
 
02:23:24.319 --> 02:23:25.030 align:start position:0%
reached and we've all learned to live
with

02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are no state or federal monies
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
that go towards
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
performing abortions and that's
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
something that's been made clear over
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
and over again
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
why we need to take it to the next level
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
why we need to have the finance
 
02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:39.750 align:start position:0%
why we need to have the finance
committee

02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
make a policy decision on probably
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
next to gun positions
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
one of the most controversial things
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
this house deals with
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
i don't see why we want to put ourselves
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
in that position god knows we have
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
enough things else we can disagree on
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm asking is that we
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
not deal with either of these amendments
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
find both of them inexpedient and we
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
stick with the language that's there
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'm as equally as unhappy with
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
the languages there
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
as you are but at least isn't that what
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
they always say a good compromise is
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
is something that both sides aren't
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
happy with but they get up with
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um are there any
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh other comments i i i have
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
comments to make but i i want to not
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
exceed my privilege here i i think we
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
this family planning money is in the
 
02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:50.389 align:start position:0%
this family planning money is in the
budget

02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
the family planning program is something
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on and in an effort to
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
agree on what we agree on i think
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
we all agree that um
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
having accessible and that means
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
financially and physically accessible
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh std checks and
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
family planning counseling for uh for
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
birth control
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh and the like are those are those are
 
02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
uh and the like are those are those are
good

02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:24.450 align:start position:0%
societal investments
 
02:25:24.450 --> 02:25:25.750 align:start position:0%
societal investments
[Music]

[Music]
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
i think the that most of the
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
clinics that accept the family planning
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
program money
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
historically have not also operated
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
under the same roof
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
as the i i
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
i i will refer to it as a reproductive
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
health facility even though personally i
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
think that's a tremendously orwellian
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
and inappropriate term for what
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
but abortion is a constitutionally
 
02:26:01.439 --> 02:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
but abortion is a constitutionally
protected

02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
medical procedure and although i'm
 
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
pro-life i'm also very pro-constitution
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
i i am not wanting to attack
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
the right of a woman to have an abortion
 
02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:17.190 align:start position:0%
the right of a woman to have an abortion
because

02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh the constitutional arguments have
 
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:20.309 align:start position:0%
uh the constitutional arguments have
been

02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
weighed and have held that a woman has
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
that right
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
certainly in the first trimester and so
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i was very comfortable with removing
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
what referred to as the gag order
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
because i
 
02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
i i think it would be totally
 
02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:39.590 align:start position:0%
i i think it would be totally
inappropriate

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
to have a medical counselor presenting
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
a woman with all of her options on birth
 
02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
a woman with all of her options on birth
control

02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
and prohibited by the state
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
to speak about one of the options that
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
she may have should she
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
become pregnant so um
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i i i'm i'm on board with the notion
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
that it would be inappropriate to try to
 
02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:06.710 align:start position:0%
that it would be inappropriate to try to
ban

02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
ban
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
those kinds of communications
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
so where am i falling on this i'm
 
02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:13.750 align:start position:0%
so where am i falling on this i'm
falling

02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
falling
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
on my background in radiology
 
02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:18.309 align:start position:0%
on my background in radiology
administration

02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
and understanding the stark act
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
and the purposes of the stark act dating
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
back 40 years
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
as kind of an anti-kickback program
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the basic premise of the
 
02:27:32.399 --> 02:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
and the basic premise of the
anti-kickback

02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
anti-kickback
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
law was that if a provider
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
was going to profit from the medical
 
02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:42.469 align:start position:0%
was going to profit from the medical
referral

02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
referral
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
then that provider should not own
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
the facility that they refer to
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
and clearly planned parenthood
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
does not fall under the stark act but
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm using it as an example to explain
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
the principle
 
02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:03.910 align:start position:0%
the principle
that

02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
the organization that's doing the
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
medical counseling
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
should not have a financial incentive
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
to skew their recommendations
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
towards one medical procedure over
 
02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:20.150 align:start position:0%
towards one medical procedure over
another

02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
and i think the value of a physical
 
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
and financial segregation is to
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that medical counseling
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
is done with the full focus on the woman
 
02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:33.190 align:start position:0%
is done with the full focus on the woman
and

02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
her and her family's needs without
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
being jaundiced possibly
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
by a profit incentive of referring
 
02:28:43.439 --> 02:28:44.070 align:start position:0%
by a profit incentive of referring
somebody

02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
over to the abortion wing of the
 
02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:47.750 align:start position:0%
over to the abortion wing of the
facility

02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so for
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
the principles of anti-kickback in the
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
principles of the stark act although not
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
legally applicable
 
02:29:00.389 --> 02:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
the principle i think is still there and
 
02:29:00.399 --> 02:29:00.790 align:start position:0%
the principle i think is still there and
so

02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
i am actually in favor of this
 
02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:04.790 align:start position:0%
i am actually in favor of this
stripped-down

02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
stripped-down
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
amendment and um
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that uh
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
some current historical providers may
 
02:29:14.399 --> 02:29:14.950 align:start position:0%
some current historical providers may
choose

02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
choose
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
not to provide continue to provide
 
02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
not to provide continue to provide
service

02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
they may choose not to compete for these
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
family planning dollars
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
but as we heard there were alternative
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
medical facilities
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
within two miles of every reproductive
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
health facility
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
taking a family planning contract and so
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
we have good reason to believe that
 
02:29:42.150 --> 02:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
substitute providers will enter into the
 
02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:43.590 align:start position:0%
substitute providers will enter into the
competition

02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
competition
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe given that there's fresh
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
competition we might
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually benefit from
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
free market competition a little bit to
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
see if we can get
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
better overall services so i
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
i do think that this is a legitimate hb2
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
although there is a big policy issue
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
here i think there's also the financial
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
issue the financial issue is
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know should we accept
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah which what do we believe do we
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
competition will increase and improve
 
02:30:19.439 --> 02:30:20.070 align:start position:0%
competition will increase and improve
services

02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
or do do we think that maintaining
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh what's become sort of a hardwired
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
non-competitive environment is the right
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
way to go
 
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
so so i i would i would like to
 
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
ask for support for this uh this
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
amendment zero nine
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
four zero h representative
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
rogers your hand is up yes i have a
 
02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
rogers your hand is up yes i have a
question

02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that you actually
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
family health clinics are making a
 
02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:50.550 align:start position:0%
family health clinics are making a
profit

02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
profit
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
off abortions and so they're counseling
 
02:30:53.359 --> 02:30:53.910 align:start position:0%
off abortions and so they're counseling
people

02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
to get abortions as a form of birth
 
02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:57.510 align:start position:0%
to get abortions as a form of birth
control

02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's that direct i think
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
there's wide belief
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
that money is fungible and that the
 
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:04.630 align:start position:0%
that money is fungible and that the
money

02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is funding the the
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
the side of the accounts dealing with
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
family planning and family planning
 
02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:15.190 align:start position:0%
family planning and family planning
counseling

02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
are not directly paying for abortion but
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
given that they're being offered by the
 
02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
same provider
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
it is recognized in the principles of
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
the stark act that there should be uh
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
separation within the referral pattern
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
and and i i think that's been accepted
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
for 40 years
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's barred orthopedic surgeons for
 
02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:39.750 align:start position:0%
it's barred orthopedic surgeons for
example

02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
from owning their own radiology services
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
so if somebody comes in with a broken
 
02:31:44.399 --> 02:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
so if somebody comes in with a broken
arm

02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
arm
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
the orthopedic surgeon needs to refer to
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
an independent radiology
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
business and not just refer to
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
themselves in their own
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
owned equipment and so
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i think the spirit of
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
of separating an orthopedic surgeon from
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
owning radiology equipment
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
is not that different in
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
concept from requiring a separation from
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
a family planning
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
counselor from um the provision of the
 
02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.750 align:start position:0%
counselor from um the provision of the
abortion

02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
that that that's what i believe i would
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
just caution you
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
um if i could follow up on this um yes
 
02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:25.110 align:start position:0%
um if i could follow up on this um yes
yeah

02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
no we're having a conversation neither
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill has been introduced so we're just
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
we're just talking i guess i would would
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
ask you to
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
to go to one of these clinics first of
 
02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:37.110 align:start position:0%
to go to one of these clinics first of
all

02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you if you've ever not if you've ever
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
been to one
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
um i'd ask you to go again and talk to
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
some of the women that are patients
 
02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
some of the women that are patients
there

02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
um if you have an abortion it's far
 
02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:48.790 align:start position:0%
um if you have an abortion it's far
different

02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
than having an orthopedic surgeon work
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
on your arm or your
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
leg it's a far harder decision
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it's a far different feeling than
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
having someone
 
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
operate on you as as any other thing
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
that would happen it's something that
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
fortunately representative edwards
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
you would never have to deal with but um
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
people that work in these clinics first
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
of all have to suffer with wondering if
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to be bombed
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if someone's going to shoot
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
them when they leave often going through
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
picket lines when they get in to go to
 
02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:23.590 align:start position:0%
picket lines when they get in to go to
work

02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the people that they deal with they
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
work very hard to counsel them with a
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
lot of things
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i assure you that abortion is one of
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
the last things
 
02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
that a woman does when they're under
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
these situations
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not something that they counsel
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
someone to do
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
to make a profit um there's a lot of
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
other things
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
that goes on at this clinic other than
 
02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:47.349 align:start position:0%
that goes on at this clinic other than
abortions

02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other things to save
 
02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
women's lives that happen
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
and to have an abortion and to liken
 
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
having abortion
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
having surgery on your arm is is
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
very very wrong kind of
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
likeness it's very different
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate that as an attorney you
 
02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:09.830 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate that as an attorney you
understand

02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
that probably understand the distinction
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the analogies
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
my analogy is for the anti-kickback
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
incentive of the counselor not
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
the very difficult decision of the woman
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm perfectly good with
 
02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:28.070 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm perfectly good with
removing

02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
removing
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
the gag order so that they can receive
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
women can receive counseling on their
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
full range of options so that they can
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
make that very difficult decision in an
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
informed way what i'm what i think this
 
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it removes
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
the the hidden finger on the scale of
 
02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:47.750 align:start position:0%
the the hidden finger on the scale of
counseling

02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the counseling is
 
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
offered without a profit
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
incentive to bias their
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
counseling potentially but what if you
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
ask me
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
you asked me to go visit a
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
family practice or excuse me a
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
reproductive health facility and
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
and i did as a member of hhs go spend
 
02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:11.030 align:start position:0%
and i did as a member of hhs go spend
time

02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
with uh on the honorable pauli
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh campion and i think
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh mary kay
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
um oh god it's killing me that i'm
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
missing their last name
 
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
but anyways i have gone and i met
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
miss kyla montgomery there and we spent
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of time
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
talking about it and if as i remember i
 
02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
recommended to them that they do a much
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
better job
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
of advertising and marketing the fact
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
that they're providing std services
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
and to report to the public in a more
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
transparent way
 
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
what the trends were so that people's
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
behavior could be modified by the
 
02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
information i
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
gave them some advice on how to make
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
their services
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
more useful to the society so i've been
 
02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:00.630 align:start position:0%
more useful to the society so i've been
there

02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
and although i'm pro-life
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
i am also sworn to protect
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
this medical procedure so um
 
02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
on on a personal level the first time i
 
02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
went into an abortion center was as a
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
young man
 
02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
and when i was a never mind i'm going to
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
tell that story but
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's a personal story where this is a
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
very real
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
issue to me and as a father of two
 
02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:30.950 align:start position:0%
issue to me and as a father of two
daughters

02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
daughters
 
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's a brother of four sisters i don't
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
i don't minimize or take lightly the
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty of the decision
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
that the woman has to make what i'm what
 
02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
that the woman has to make what i'm what
this

02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it doesn't affect the
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
woman's choice
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
at all it affects
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
who is providing the family planning
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
counselor and it's doing it on the basis
 
02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:58.389 align:start position:0%
counselor and it's doing it on the basis
of

02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there is no financial
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
incentive to counsel more in one
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
direction than another
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
your hand is up dude yeah if i could
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
make this one last point is
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
i said it's not just the woman that's
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
there the counselors
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to work in an environment that is
 
02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
have to work in an environment that is
as

02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
we can see from around the country quite
 
02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
often a target
 
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
for not only protests but violent
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
protests for bombing
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
for all kinds of things so they are
 
02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
under a lot of pressure
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
and they are not given an incentive they
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
do not make bonuses for the amount of
 
02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:34.950 align:start position:0%
do not make bonuses for the amount of
abortions

02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
that they they counsel people to have
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
told to counsel people to have abortions
 
02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's no finger on the scale
 
02:37:46.150 --> 02:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
these are counselors that are committed
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
to being
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
um helpful to women they're committed to
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
their cause so to speak
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
for women's health so um it's not a
 
02:37:54.399 --> 02:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
for women's health so um it's not a
business

02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that they are
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
committed to and they're committed to
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
women's health
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
so um that's why i have a little bit of
 
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
a problem with this and i also do think
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's an impossibility for the ones that
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
exist to ask them to build a new
 
02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:09.510 align:start position:0%
exist to ask them to build a new
facility

02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
so that it's physically separate is an
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
impossible situation for them to make
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
so while i appreciate your intent i
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
think that this will in fact
 
02:38:21.030 --> 02:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
put some people out of business and i'm
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
not so sure that there will be other
 
02:38:22.479 --> 02:38:23.429 align:start position:0%
not so sure that there will be other
competition

02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
competition
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
or that we will not limit women's
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
accessibility in other states this kind
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
going into statute has in fact limited
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of places
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
and in some states actually um and i'm
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
forgetting the state right now but it's
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
one state that it and my understanding
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
is it
 
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
actually um took away any center where
 
02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:45.910 align:start position:0%
actually um took away any center where
someone

02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
could get an abortion in the state they
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
had to go elsewhere so
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
i thank you for for your intentions and
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
i guess we just have to agree to have
 
02:38:56.309 --> 02:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
opposing views here
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
right and and um i
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
obviously no one is going to change
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
anyone's mind
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
in this discussion you know that i think
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
our objective
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
is to be clear on our own positions so
 
02:39:10.319 --> 02:39:10.870 align:start position:0%
is to be clear on our own positions so
that

02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
that those positions can be understood i
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
i think we're long past
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
changing anyone's mind on this
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
particular topic
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
and you've twice mentioned the threat of
 
02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:21.830 align:start position:0%
and you've twice mentioned the threat of
violence

02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
in um and the threat of violence in any
 
02:39:25.359 --> 02:39:26.790 align:start position:0%
in um and the threat of violence in any
situation

02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
is is potentially there and
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh many years ago in another part of the
 
02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
country there
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
there was in fact some violence but i
 
02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
think we're very fortunate that we've
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
never experienced that sort of thing in
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
so at least not that i know of rep
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren
 
02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would just um
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
piggyback on what representative rogers
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
is saying
 
02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i think one of my big concerns will
 
02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:56.070 align:start position:0%
and i think one of my big concerns will
be

02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
the north country and the parts of the
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
state that are
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
already underserved by all medical
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
professions and i think that could this
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
could bring an
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
extra burden to that part of the
 
02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:11.030 align:start position:0%
extra burden to that part of the
population

02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so i think that should
 
02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
be a concern in our discussion
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you can i share your concern
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and it was my understanding from mr
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
tierney's uh
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh the the
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
what we'll call the northern providers
 
02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:30.230 align:start position:0%
what we'll call the northern providers
uh

02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're not also providing um
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the reproductive health facility
 
02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
services i.e
 
02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
outpatient abortion centers that they
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
they that they were providing family
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
planning without the abortions and if a
 
02:40:46.399 --> 02:40:47.110 align:start position:0%
planning without the abortions and if a
woman

02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
woman
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
chose an abortion the referral would
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
have to be down to concord or
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
another place performing the procedure
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know that this is is a risk
 
02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
to those facilities because they've been
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
receiving family planning money they'd
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
continue to get family planning money
 
02:41:05.439 --> 02:41:06.070 align:start position:0%
continue to get family planning money
and

02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
potentially because we're reopening this
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
up to a more
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
aggressive competition you know maybe
 
02:41:14.830 --> 02:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have more money to stretch
 
02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:17.590 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have more money to stretch
further

02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up i don't know if
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
you want to respond
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
could i just please react to your
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
comment i resentment
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
no we're having a conversation please do
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay i resent
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
your characterization of
 
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.429 align:start position:0%
your characterization of
abortion

02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
buildings i mean i think that's
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
not the context we're talking about
 
02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i i i accept your resentment
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%

02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
no need
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
to discuss or vote on the
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
leon amendment we could having passed
 
02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment we can
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%

not seeing any um i think what we can do
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
is move on to hb1 to take a look at the
 
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
family planning lines
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh in general we have representative irf
 
02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh in general we have representative irf
who's

02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
who's
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
done some analysis representative rogers
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
who's done some analysis
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
and in general what what i understand to
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
be the case
 
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
is that when the previous federal
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
administration was in
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
office they
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
removed funds from
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the federal level and that the state
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the current budget year decided that
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
good to invest enough money
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
to fill that gap and
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that the current
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
federal administration
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
will return to the previous policy of
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
direct funding
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
um reproductive health facilities
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh and so so there's an issue
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
of what should we be doing with the
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
given that the availability of federal
 
02:45:12.399 --> 02:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
given that the availability of federal
funds

02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be different in the current
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
in the next budget that we're working on
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the current budget that
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so with that as a backdrop uh
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative ruer for you
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
um can you are you able to share your
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
screen as mr ripple let you
 
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
do that or is he sharing your screen or
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
how's that working
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
mr ripple has all the information let me
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
just pull it up here
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
did you want me to start with the
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
amendment itself representative
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes please miss ripple
 
02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:45:53.429 --> 02:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
this might be yeah this is the wrong one
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
hold on a sec
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
so this proposal funds the family
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
planning budget
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
at what it has been historically
 
02:46:07.269 --> 02:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
preceding bienniums
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
and accounts for the actual spending in
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
2016 the actual spending was one million
 
02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
one hundred sixty eight thousand four
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
hundred and twelve dollars
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the actual spending was one
 
02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:19.670 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the actual spending was one
million

02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
two hundred sixty thousand nine hundred
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
forty six dollars
 
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
this budget is one million forty two
 
02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
this budget is one million forty two
thousand

02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
six hundred forty three dollars in fy
 
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
twenty two
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
and one million fifty four thousand four
 
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
and seventeen dollars
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
in fy twenty three the federal title ten
 
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
allotment for new hampshire
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
is 800 000 while recent budgets have
 
02:46:42.389 --> 02:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
included a much
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
much larger amount six hundred thousand
 
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
dollars of that
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
has not flowed through new hampshire but
 
02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
went directly to planned parenthood
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire title 10 funding can be
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
used for overhead
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
and pharmaceuticals in addition to
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
family planning services
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the recent past medicaid funding
 
02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
for family planning services was
 
02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:04.950 align:start position:0%
for family planning services was
expanded

02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
miners now qualify for medicaid family
 
02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:08.790 align:start position:0%
miners now qualify for medicaid family
planning

02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
planning
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
funding based on their own income and
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
not that of their parents
 
02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
this means essentially all miners
 
02:47:18.150 --> 02:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
qualify for medicaid
 
02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
family planning services which are
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
independent of the title 10 services
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
at the same time the income threshold
 
02:47:27.990 --> 02:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
for adults to qualify
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
for medicaid funding for family planning
 
02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
for medicaid funding for family planning
services

02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
increased in a manner similar to that
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the expanded medicaid for health
 
02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:36.230 align:start position:0%
for the expanded medicaid for health
care

02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
this means many more adults also qualify
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
for medicaid
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
family planning services this means
 
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
clinics have two
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
revenue streams supporting family
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
planning services medicaid funding
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
which comes directly from the federal
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
government and title 10 funding
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
which in new hampshire can come by the
 
02:47:55.439 --> 02:47:56.389 align:start position:0%
which in new hampshire can come by the
state

02:47:56.389 --> 02:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
or planned parenthood medicaid funding
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
covers family planning services without
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
limit while clinics can use their title
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
10 funding
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
to cover their overhead and
 
02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:07.349 align:start position:0%
to cover their overhead and
pharmaceuticals

02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
this can be seen in the recent family
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
planning contracts approved by the
 
02:48:11.990 --> 02:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
but the services component of the
 
02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
contracts has trended down
 
02:48:18.389 --> 02:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
as that is covered by medicaid in
 
02:48:18.399 --> 02:48:19.269 align:start position:0%
as that is covered by medicaid in
addition

02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
addition
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
recent changes allowing for the use of
 
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
telehealth and providing family planning
 
02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:24.469 align:start position:0%
telehealth and providing family planning
services

02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
and a change in prescribing
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals allowing for 12-month
 
02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:28.950 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals allowing for 12-month
prescriptions

02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
rather than three months means cost of
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
services have decreased as well
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
the net effect is that new hampshire
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
need not be as financially involved
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
with the provision of family planning
 
02:48:42.309 --> 02:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
services as it has been
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
in fact our neighboring state of maine
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
in our neighboring state of maine the
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
state is not involved at
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
all with title 10 funding that funding
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
flows directly to family planning
 
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
association of maine
 
02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:01.429 align:start position:0%
association of maine
inc

02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
and there is the budget that you could i
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
just described to you that kevin's got
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
up on the uh
 
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
screen so i'm i if you could mr rip will
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the key numbers here
 
02:49:13.269 --> 02:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
so we
 
02:49:19.190 --> 02:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
so in fy 22
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like the governor's bill is
 
02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
introduced to the house
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
had 2.977 million dollars in the
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
is am i reading that right yes
 
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative irf is recommending a
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
reduction of 1.934 million
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
for a net of 1.042 million in general
 
02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:47.590 align:start position:0%
for a net of 1.042 million in general
funds

02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
for fy22
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's the total appropriation the
 
02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
general funds are
 
02:49:57.990 --> 02:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
down here do you
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
so so representative erf i i
 
02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
i can understand the basic construct
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
that the federal money was not available
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the prior in the current budget and
 
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
stepped up its contribution to make up
 
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
for the gap
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i can accept the concept that now
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
that the federal
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
government's going to step back in with
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
its funding new hampshire no longer
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
needs to continue to provide that gap
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time seeing these
 
02:50:57.990 --> 02:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
numbers and
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
matching it to those two concepts
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
can you help me with that
 
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
i no i don't understand what you're
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
asking so
 
02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
if you go back as i said to 2016
 
02:51:15.269 --> 02:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
and 2018 the family planning budgets
 
02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
were comparable to what
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
i have there in that budget if you're
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
only looking at the current biennium
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
you're looking at basically you'll
 
02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
notice there's two lines there now 102
 
02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
and 103.
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
103 did not exist prior to this current
 
02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:32.469 align:start position:0%
103 did not exist prior to this current
biennium

02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
and what happened was in when we
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
as you indicated the at the time
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
the federal government was preventing
 
02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
monies going to planned parenthood
 
02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
through title 10 funding
 
02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
you'll notice though that the number
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
there for the 102 line
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the same in other
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
words that didn't change
 
02:51:58.230 --> 02:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
from other from the biennium before from
 
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
the years by name before or
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
to my proposal in this biennium what
 
02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
happened was 1.6 million dollars was
 
02:52:07.429 --> 02:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
added in per year
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
to get around the federal title 10
 
02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:10.710 align:start position:0%
to get around the federal title 10
restrictions

02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
02:52:13.830 --> 02:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
now in fact i think we may recall that
 
02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:14.150 align:start position:0%
now in fact i think we may recall that
miss

02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
miss
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
rounds told us that in fact that 1.6
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
million is not
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
what flowed through the state of new
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire eight hundred thousand dollars
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
flows to the state of new hampshire same
 
02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
as the eight hundred thousand dollars on
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's in the budget that i've proposed
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
the other money and i don't actually
 
02:52:32.230 --> 02:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
even believe it was necessarily a
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars i think it might have
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
been 800
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
600 000 but in any case that money went
 
02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
directly to planned parenthood
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
so it's a little difficult to compare
 
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
apples to apples for on the one hand
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
on the other hand the budget doubled
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
essentially even if you exclude the 600
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
directly to planned parenthood the
 
02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
budget doubled
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
in this most current biennium from the
 
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
biennium's prior to that
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
and all we're doing all i'm proposing is
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
that we bring it back to
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
the way it was budgeted prior to the
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
current biennium
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative question
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was wondering if
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe kayla from planned parenthood
 
02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
is on
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
if she could comment i i thought there
 
02:53:16.479 --> 02:53:18.710 align:start position:0%
if she could comment i i thought there
was

02:53:18.710 --> 02:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:23.030 --> 02:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
a large gap between when our funding
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
ends and the feds take over again
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
so i'd just like a clarification on that
 
02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:30.469 align:start position:0%
so i'd just like a clarification on that
please

02:53:30.469 --> 02:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
so so let's let representative rogers do
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
her her piece and if we still need
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
somebody so a participant then then we
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
can consider it that
 
02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
at that point because representative
 
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
rogers may have the answer you're
 
02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
hey thank you representative rogers
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
are you and mr ripple prepared to
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
to show your version i believe he has
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.349 --> 02:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
basically what my amendment does is um
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
fills the gap that representative earth
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
says doesn't exist
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
um it is true that the federal monies
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
the biden administrationist says that
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
that the federal gag rule is going to be
 
02:54:11.439 --> 02:54:13.030 align:start position:0%
that the federal gag rule is going to be
lifted

02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
lifted
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
and the federal monies will in fact come
 
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
back however
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
the federal monies won't flow back into
 
02:54:20.230 --> 02:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
the state for
 
02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
probably approximately nine months so
 
02:54:24.630 --> 02:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
there will be a nine month gap so the
 
02:54:26.230 --> 02:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
amount that i've put in here in the
 
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
um would certainly get us through those
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
nine months
 
02:54:33.429 --> 02:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
when the federal monies will not be
 
02:54:33.439 --> 02:54:34.950 align:start position:0%
when the federal monies will not be
coming

02:54:34.950 --> 02:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
and that's why i've increased the lines
 
02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the general fund to cover that amount
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
of time
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
and two years ago yes it's true we did
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
increase the general fund
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
but that was in his in the anticipation
 
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds
 
02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
decreasing and also as i said
 
02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
previously the fact that we are in the
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
midst of
 
02:54:58.890 --> 02:54:58.900 align:start position:0%
and we were two years ago
 
02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:00.630 align:start position:0%
and we were two years ago
[Music]

02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:55:04.710 --> 02:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
epidemic of stds and these
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
family planning clinics were doing as i
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
said 97
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
of the testing on these stds and
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
they in fact had grown at the amount of
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
exorbitant i can't remember the exact
 
02:55:18.710 --> 02:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
percentage two years ago but
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
the stds had grown an exorbitant amount
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
very fast
 
02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
and the department was quite concerned
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
about this epidemic of the stds we
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to get a handle on it
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
and there was no funding in any place
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
else for it
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to try to deal with that
 
02:55:35.190 --> 02:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
which is part of the reason
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
that we increased the funding um was to
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
deal with that that epidemic that was
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
so there was a large jump to deal with
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
those two things
 
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
along with the anticipation of the
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
cutback in the federal funds and in fact
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
those federal funds did decrease and
 
02:55:54.389 --> 02:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
were not
 
02:55:58.070 --> 02:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
gained during that time if you recall
 
02:56:00.469 --> 02:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
carrie runs did tell us that the federal
 
02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
money actually
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in this budget that it goes
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the centers directly
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
and she'd put it in here for us to see
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
what it amounted to
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
but it does go to the clinics all
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
separately as my understanding
 
02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
but this figure that i've got is for a
 
02:56:22.230 --> 02:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
nine-month period of time
 
02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll cover the clinics
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
until that federal money
 
02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
comes in can you ask your question about
 
02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
comes in can you ask your question about
that

02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:33.110 --> 02:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure i'll try to answer okay so
 
02:56:35.590 --> 02:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm trying to process what you're
 
02:56:38.230 --> 02:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
saying and what i would expect
 
02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
to see on line 103
 
02:56:45.550 --> 02:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
is that first
 
02:56:49.830 --> 02:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
1.6 million we're thinking
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
isn't going to start well wait a second
 
02:56:58.389 --> 02:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
if 1.6 million is a year why would nine
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
months be 1.2 million
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
these are the numbers that i got from um
 
02:57:08.230 --> 02:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
the the folks in the family planning um
 
02:57:09.670 --> 02:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
clinics that this was the amount they
 
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
would need to get through the nine
 
02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:13.429 align:start position:0%
would need to get through the nine
months

02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
i got numbers from them for three months
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
six months and nine months so
 
02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and i decided to go for nine months
 
02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
since it was the time i needed
 
02:57:25.990 --> 02:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
um so i can't break it down for you this
 
02:57:28.469 --> 02:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
was the number i reached out to get
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
and this is what i came back with and
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
so do we expect the current
 
02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:37.429 align:start position:0%
so do we expect the current
administration

02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be more generous in its family
 
02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:40.790 align:start position:0%
to be more generous in its family
planning

02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
planning
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
spending than what occurred before the
 
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
previous administration i i don't know
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
whether they will be or not i think that
 
02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's something we're all waiting to
 
02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:51.269 align:start position:0%
that's something we're all waiting to
see

02:57:51.269 --> 02:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:57:53.990 --> 02:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
um i think it'll be more more generous
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
obviously than the
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
um last four years but if you're asking
 
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
me if it will be more generous than the
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
four years prior to that
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
i i think that that would be just
 
02:58:03.359 --> 02:58:07.190 align:start position:0%
i i think that that would be just
conjecture

02:58:07.190 --> 02:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
if you have questions representative
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
verb i'm sorry
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
i heard some speaking but i said it
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
would just be like
 
02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
blind guessing on my part to answer that
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative questions
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
well just a couple of points i actually
 
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't understand what this gap is that's
 
02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
being referred to
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
but the current title 10 family planning
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
grants made in 2019
 
02:58:37.269 --> 02:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
apply through march 31st of 2022 that'd
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
be next year
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's one point so i'm not sure what
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
what what the gap is
 
02:58:45.190 --> 02:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
the other point though is that all std
 
02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:45.670 align:start position:0%
the other point though is that all std
testing

02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
testing
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
is free under medicaid which is
 
02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
completely independent
 
02:58:55.429 --> 02:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:01.510 --> 02:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
i think i would benefit if
 
02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative rogers and representative
 
02:59:06.479 --> 02:59:07.429 align:start position:0%
representative rogers and representative
irf

02:59:07.429 --> 02:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
irf
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
talked to each other and bounced their
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
numbers around and then we revisited
 
02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
this tomorrow
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
i i i i i i'm not really doing a good
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
job with sort of the dueling
 
02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and i have to look at them
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
both and
 
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
think about them as representative irf
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
and representative rogers
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
are you willing to spend some time today
 
02:59:29.279 --> 02:59:29.990 align:start position:0%
are you willing to spend some time today
to

02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:59:33.030 --> 02:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
to try to compare notes and figure out
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:37.439 --> 02:59:40.469 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to speak with
 
02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative rogers we're in
 
02:59:46.150 --> 02:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
two very different places just beginning
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't begin from the same place
 
02:59:50.070 --> 02:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes sir that that's why i asked you to
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
figure out what you can agree to agree
 
02:59:51.920 --> 02:59:53.670 align:start position:0%
figure out what you can agree to agree
on

02:59:53.670 --> 02:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:59:56.950 --> 02:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay so uh so i
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
i just i i unders i take it as a given
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be disagreement
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think it would benefit the committee
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
if you guys were able to explain to us
 
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
what you can agree to agree on on this
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then what the distinctions are
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
between you and and then i think we'd be
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:20.950 --> 03:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.269 --> 03:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
03:00:35.110 --> 03:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're ready to look at that
 
03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're ready to look at that
hb2

03:00:38.950 --> 03:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
on um on the legacy of the mms legacy
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
okay and this is not numbered this would
 
03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
be a new hb2
 
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative norgren did i miss you
 
03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
well i think i may have misnumbered the
 
03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
well i think i may have misnumbered the
mmi
