okay um
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
as i said this uh we had three bills
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
that were all related to uh
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the workplace
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%

12 10
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
and 13 51
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
so what we did is the subcommittee was
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
formed and
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
i had the three prime sponsors of the
 
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.189 align:start position:0%
i had the three prime sponsors of the
bills

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much get together
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
with a few of us occasionally
 
00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.189 align:start position:0%
with a few of us occasionally
and

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
attempt to come up with an amendment
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
that would encompass
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
what we thought or what the
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
taking the good out of them and
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
releasing some of the bad in them so
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
what came out of that was
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative lang i'm going to have
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
him speak to it he uh did the majority
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
of the work on it so
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative um
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
so on on this amendment we did we took
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
those three bills we found segments of
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bills that we thought all thought
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
were worked well um the first of which
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
is the the general findings section i'm
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
just making a statement a fact about the
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
general what what we believe as a
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
general court
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
um in speaking with both ols you know as
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
we were this is like the fifth draft of
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment um as we were working
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
with everybody and speaking a less we
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
felt it was important to separate out
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
the business aspect from the educational
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
aspect and put the business and labor
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
law and the labor law statutes and put
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
the educational laws
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
into educational statutes rather than do
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
it as one
 
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.870 align:start position:0%
it as one
simple

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
one bill that encompasses both in in a
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
single paragraph so you'll see
 
00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.150 align:start position:0%
single paragraph so you'll see
um

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
we we brought out in uh in 275 78
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
we we talk about the exemption vaccine
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
mandates public and private employers
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
um we change this to do um to talk about
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
only businesses that take federal
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
federal estate funds is the first thing
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
we set a qualifier so it doesn't apply
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
to all businesses that if you have a
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
private business 100 private doesn't
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
have any governmental interaction other
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
than paying taxes then they would would
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
not be subject to this law if they take
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
federal money or take state money in any
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
way shape or form then they would be
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
subject to this this new new rule
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
um and the rule does the same thing as
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
we talked about before it creates uh the
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
law creates a simple form allowing the
 
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.830 align:start position:0%
law creates a simple form allowing the
uh

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
employee or two or student in the second
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
half of the bill to um choose that they
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
they fall within one of three categories
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and then on the employer side we made a
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
significant change where before we had
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
we talked about reasonable
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
accommodations and that's a standard
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
practice in business that they do even
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
currently now
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
we said that originally in the original
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
amendment we talked about the word will
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
where it says the employer on line 22 of
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
the first page the employer it now says
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
may then work with an employee and we
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
had will originally kind of like a
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
forced mandate on the business and we
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
chose not to do that we chose to
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
back that off and change it to may so if
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
there's a way for the employer to work
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
with the uh employee we want to see them
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
do that if possible
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
there may be certain terms and circumst
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
or certain circumstances where that's
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
not possible um and so we left that
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
provision to the to the business
 
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.309 align:start position:0%
provision to the to the business
um

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
we created a separability clause so if
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
anything in this uh section three of the
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill page one um that if any
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
portion of this law is uh deemed
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um then only that
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
segment of the law is strict not the
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
entire law
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
um and then we do the same thing we go
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
into the education statutes and we have
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
the same exact terms and conditions
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
again if it's a if it's a school that
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
takes federal or state money um and then
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
we have the same process for the student
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
submitting a request for an exemption in
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
the post-secondary education
 
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
the post-secondary education
um

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
i think this is a ex you know we again i
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
worked with the prime sponsors i i
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
worked with several members um i thought
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
this was a reasonable um amendment to
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
kind of consolidate everything down you
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
know it's a real delicate balancing act
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
protect the business right to do
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
business and protect a citizen's right
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
to be a citizen and not be imposed upon
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
unreasonably and so i think this bill
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
does that
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
balances those two to rights so to speak
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lang do we have
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.030 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
committee

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative blang i you pointed out
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
the um
uh

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
statement in line 22 the employer may
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
then work with the employee to see if an
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
agreement for reasonable accommodation
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
can be reached
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
what do you envision as being a
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation in this
 
00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.870 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation in this
situation

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
um and two if the accommodation cannot
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
be reached what happens
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for your question and and
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
what i'll say is that this is current
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
business practice already so they do
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
this already um prior to coving the
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
politization of covid and and everything
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
businesses routinely dealt with
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
exemption requests um so i'll give you
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
examples i'm subject to him to a vaccine
 
00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
examples i'm subject to him to a vaccine
mandate

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
i chose i didn't want to give my data to
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
my business so i told them that i said
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not telling you my vaccines it's
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
none of your business i said but i'm
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
willing to accept accommodation and you
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
can treat me as if i'm unvaccinated
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of what my status is and my
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
business chose to ask me to test
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
whenever i go into the office if i'm
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
gonna be around other fellow employees
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
or i'm gonna be backstage because i
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
happen to work in a concert field and i
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
felt that was a reasonable accommodation
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
i said i'll accept that because my
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
infection status is more important than
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
my vaccine status so in this case i
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
chose to accept that accommodation i
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
felt it was reasonable they have they
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
have a significant business interest
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
that i recognize and i felt that my
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
my accepting the testing was a
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable response so
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
there may be other circumstances and
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
again i'll go back to what i said in the
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this bill you know we
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
use uh in nursing right which is where
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
this this most often comes up
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
in a cancer ward
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
right i think it may be and i'm not
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
saying it is because i don't know all
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
the case law behind it but it may be
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable for a hospital say there are
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
no accommodations that you can make that
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
would that could reduce the risk
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
significantly enough to protect our
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
cancer patients so therefore if you
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
refuse to get uh
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated then we're gonna move you
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
into a different ward you cannot work in
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
oncology that may be a reasonable i
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if it is again but i could
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
understand why a hospital may want to
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
make that statement and be allowed and
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
then it's up for them to defend that if
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
the employee says that's unreasonable
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
and they can file a wrongful termination
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
suit um but again i think that that's
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
again current law this is currently
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
what's happening already um i mean when
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
i say current law it's current practice
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
in businesses we're just putting it into
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.829 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:02.550 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think what i heard you say wrongful
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
terminations so i believe that implies
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
that if the employer and the employee
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
cannot agree on an accommodation then
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
the employee would likely be terminated
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
the employer has the right to terminate
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh where the employee is the right to
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
quit either one
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative bouchard
 
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.269 align:start position:0%
representative bouchard
um

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
question

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm pretty clear about what a
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
medical exemption is
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption is
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
define to me what the right of
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
conscience exemption is
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
my most favorite question i get asked
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
right now most recently
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
um so the right of conscience is a um is
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
a moral objection so i'm going to give
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
you an example and it's it's a little
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not off topic so to speak but i
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
found it when i was researching uh bills
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
on it like this
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
is that doctors enjoy the right of
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
conscience when it comes to abortion
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
a doctor can refuse to perform a
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
procedure and is protected by federal
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
law if they declare a right of
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
conscience that they find it morally
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
objectionable to perform an abortion and
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
they cannot be discriminated against if
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
so there's an example of a moral belief
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
that someone may have
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
that gives them the right not to do
 
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.710 align:start position:0%
that gives them the right not to do
something

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's any more
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to join and give
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
doctors that right of conscience and say
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
that they can choose more what is
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
morally repugnant to them
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
and and and don't want to do it and not
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
be discriminated against we should be
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
able to give our citizens that same
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
follower

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
how could you
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
relate a right of conscience
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
for a vaccination
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
how do i relate to two yeah sure so if i
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
think it's it's morally wrong to inject
 
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.550 align:start position:0%
think it's it's morally wrong to inject
myself

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
with a chemical right i i believe it
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
hurts my body in some way shape or form
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
and that's my moral belief then why
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
should i be forced to do that
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
if i you know
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's a body of evidence you know
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
around that there are implications of
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to people
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
they may be minimal it may be small it
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
may be infidesimal but if a person
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
honestly believes that it they've made
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
the decision not to inject those kind of
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
chemicals into their body and usually it
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
can be from birth you know i know
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
families that none of their kids have
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
ever been vaccinated because the parents
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
believe that it's not a good thing
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
um that's their moral belief are we
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to judge them on their moral
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
belief for that and tell them that
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
they're not entitled to their moral
 
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
they're not entitled to their moral
beliefs

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you

um
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
last year year before we had the main
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
street grants
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
sent out by the state to
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that were affected by the
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
covet 19 shutdown
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
does that make them public employers
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if i heard your question right
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
if they received
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
any covet funds would they be considered
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
a public employer is that your question
 
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.550 align:start position:0%
a public employer is that your question
correct

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
representative selma
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up to what uh
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative avalani was just saying
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
um so a restaurant that receives um
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh coveted funds as well would be um
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill correct
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
that would be my interpretation yes
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
any business that received federal funds
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
a business that chose not to receive
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds would not be subject to
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
i have uh one question representative
 
00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
i have uh one question representative
link

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
link
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
question that was was asked the right of
 
00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:20.150 align:start position:0%
question that was was asked the right of
conscience

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that that
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
we talked about it's a moral issue would
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
we would it be fair to say that the
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
right of conscience is similar to the
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
religious exception without
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
the tag of religion
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'd say that's
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
exactly correct i would say probably the
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the people that currently
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
are fall underneath the right of
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
conscience are using the religious
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions anyway so i don't think it's
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
a necessarily significant number that
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that would
 
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that would
differentiate

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
differentiate
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
for representative lange
 
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.829 align:start position:0%
for representative lange
um

00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
the other difference um when you look at
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption and the medical
 
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.150 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption and the medical
exemption

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
in adding the conscientious objection
 
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.150 align:start position:0%
in adding the conscientious objection
exemption

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
the other difference however is that all
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
they have to do is say i object
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
and there's no further questions no
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
further justification no further
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
explanation is that correct
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
if the law if this amendment is adopted
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
on all three circumstances again this
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
comes back to the question of whether or
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
not you think it's appropriate for
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
businesses to ask for medical data even
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
though they're not asking for
 
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.630 align:start position:0%
though they're not asking for
um

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
they're not asking for necessarily an
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
accommodation they're not saying i want
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
you to change my work habits because i
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
have this medical condition it's not a
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
reflective phrase i'm saying a true ada
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
requirement on religion it's even easier
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
is do we really want our businesses or
 
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
is do we really want our businesses or
um

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh you having to say tell them what what
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
religion you are what tenant of your
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
faith is and then have them check to see
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're religious enough
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
to be entitled to the exemption so in
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
all of these i don't think we should be
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
checking we self-attest to more things
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
in our society
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
on almost everything when you go into
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle you give them a driver's
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
license you give them a birth
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
certificate and some other form of id
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
social security card neither one of
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
which has your picture on it and you
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
sign a form saying this is who i am
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
right we we regularly self attest with
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
some basic information
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
and in society when you register your
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
kid for school i actually don't have to
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
show a driver's license to register my
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
kid to prove who i am so we regularly
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
believe and take on faith within the
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
government our citizens answers to
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
things and i don't think this should be
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.150 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
however at present it is different and
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
an employer is entitled to ask
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
for backup information about the medical
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
or the religious exemption correct
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct and and again one of the
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
reasons this bill came forward is is and
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
i i spoke about this i think my original
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony was on 9 12 of 2001
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
um the attorney the the surgeon general
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the united states said that he was
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to start checking into employers
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
employees whether or not they were
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
abusing the religious exemption
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
and if that doesn't take a bone-chilling
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
effect about the fact that
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
a a senior member of our government is
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to start measuring
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
our citizen spirituality
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know what is government has no
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
you can i've never done this so i'm just
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
somebody else told uh
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
i caution you mr chairman
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
mr chairman my uh
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
my opinion of a subcommittee is usually
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
what you're doing now the subcommittee
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
has their debate they discuss it okay um
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions are asked of the subcommittee
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor uh the subcommittee can
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
then ask questions of any particular
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
person out there whether it be a
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or the department you know and
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
then that would be my
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
my assumption only i was told something
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
differently by the uh
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
our administrator this goalie said
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
something different but that's fine go
 
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.190 align:start position:0%
something different but that's fine go
ahead

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
he's chairman of the subcommittee can
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
act representative
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
i have two questions one of which i just
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to follow the bouncing ball here
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
because i want to make sure you use the
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
right term you mentioned a situation
 
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
right term you mentioned a situation
where

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
someone chooses to be any of these three
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
take the vaccine
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
they tell their employer the employer
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
will endeavor to
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
provide some kind of accommodation if
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
accommodation cannot be made
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
you then said i believe you said then
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
they could file suit
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
the the procedure it is now and the
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
procedure you're continuing to go with
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
is if they cannot get
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
an accommodation they can either quit
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:23.190 align:start position:0%
they can
contest

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
contest
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
to the department of labor
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
the department of labor then
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
investigates looking at whether the
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
accommodations that were offered are
 
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
accommodations that were offered are
consistent

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.149 align:start position:0%
consistent
with

00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
past practice
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
consistent with past practice then it
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
would be fine no no problem if not then
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
the department of labor could then step
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
in and say no that's inconsistent
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
with past practice
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:51.430 align:start position:0%
and then
whatever

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
either force the employer to be more
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
consistent or then find against the
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
employer is that your understanding of
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
the way it is that is my understanding
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up please mr chairman
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing that concerns me that's
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
not been brought up thus far
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
is all these fear-mongering emails and
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
calls i've received in the last three
 
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
calls i've received in the last three
days

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
days
that

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
because this does not fit some
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
federal guideline
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars from
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes whether it be the county
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
nursing homes private nursing homes
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals associated with getting
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
interfere with that and negate that and
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
they will no longer be able to receive
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
those monies
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i can tell
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
you that this is a similar concern that
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
was brought up in in florida when they
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
they amended their their exemption
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
statutes and to date cms has done
 
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.390 align:start position:0%
statutes and to date cms has done
nothing

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the government is not acting on this
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
they recognize that exemptions um are
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
allowed um probably the biggest concern
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill is the fact that we've
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
added the right of conscience compared
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
to other than that this bill would
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
conform with all of the cms rules um the
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
the right of consciences though in new
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire has been extremely like like i
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
said in my testimonies called out
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
various explicitly is unalienable that
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
our citizens have the right um and i'll
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
be honest with you they'll be happy to
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
remove uh
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
the uh right of conscience uh in this
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
bill if someone could tell me how i can
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative lang i'm going to make
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a comment and
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
speaking to the importance of the
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
in line 22 the may versus will
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i can give you a
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
much like yourself um i've been directly
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
affected by this the whole vaccine
 
00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.470 align:start position:0%
affected by this the whole vaccine
mandate

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.870 align:start position:0%
mandate
situation

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
examples of where may
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
is much more beneficial than will only
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
because there may actually be some
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
businesses out there
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
that want to be able to point to this
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
and go write a conscience right of
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
conscience i'm going to give you the
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
exact example myself okay
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
initially last fall
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
pilots at american airlines and all of
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
the major airlines
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
fell under the
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
mandate that president biden put down on
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
we received
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
an email from our chief pilot saying you
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
have such and such amount of time to get
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated otherwise you're going to be
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
terminated for myself after 37 years of
 
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.909 align:start position:0%
terminated for myself after 37 years of
service

00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
long story short our company did not in
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
the least want to eliminate
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
20 of their workforce uh pilots you're
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to run an airline
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
when you you know get rid of 2500 pilots
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
out of 14 000.
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
so this to me when i look at this this
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be american airlines management
 
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
would be american airlines management
going

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
now we don't have to fire our pilots we
 
00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
now we don't have to fire our pilots we
don't

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
we don't want to require them to get the
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine the feds are telling us this but
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
here we get the right of conscience and
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just using my airline as an example
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
this could apply to you know
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know different businesses but would
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
you see that as a fair point
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
i do an extremely fair point again i i
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
look to use one of the governor's
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
favorite words flex right this allows
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
business to flex and manage their
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
business so they choose to manage it
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're not putting uh in that ability to
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
work or to choose to work if they need
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
to but they also may say there's no
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation necessary we don't need to
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
do anything you're fine
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
and so this allows for that in either
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
direction you can either choose to let's
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
work with it work with you and find an
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
accommodation or after reviewing in your
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
thing based if you're a home-based
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
employee there's no accommodation
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
necessary so just continue working at
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
home we don't need you to do anything so
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
again i think that this is a flexibility
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
bill it allows the flexibility for
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
businesses to be able to operate um and
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh again it's a great
 
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
balancing act between the rights of the
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
citizens and the rights of the
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
businesses thank you
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
 
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.110 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
members

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.789 align:start position:0%
members
representative

00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.430 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
and this is just
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
just for clarification for myself
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
it says on line 17 shall offer
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
the employee the opportunity to submit
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i'm driving at here is
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
is that this says that they will have to
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
have the um
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
employee know that they can uh
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
give an exemption request
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the exemption request would come in
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
that they may
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
decide to work with an agreement but
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
there aren't the the employer is under
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
no obligation
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
at all to
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
so i'd have you take a look at line 21
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
under section two where it says such
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
requests for exemption shall be granted
 
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.630 align:start position:0%
requests for exemption shall be granted
okay

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then we go into the main i withdraw
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
my request my question thank you
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
representative lang would you be willing
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
to take questions from anybody out there
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
if they have them absolutely mr chairman
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
and i don't know uh
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner ogden would you like
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
to say come up to the mic make some
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
comments and then we'll open if anybody
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
else in the
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turcotte um and
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lang in terms
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
of questions the only thing i would
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
provide is just some general uh
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
commentary specific to some of what
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
we've heard today i would just want to
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
point out relative to representative
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
avalani's question about receiving
 
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
avalani's question about receiving
funding

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
absent additional clarification we the
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
department would look at
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
lines 13 and 14 where it says any public
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
or private employer that receives public
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
funds we would look at it as something
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
of an ongoing that there is a receipt of
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
public funds if the intent is to say
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
that had they ever received public funds
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
they would fall under this umbrella i
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
think perhaps that should be clarified
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative infantine had made the
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
comment about reasonable accommodation
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
or reviewing the reasonableness of
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
accommodations i do want to be clear
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire department of
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
labor does not typically engage in that
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
type of analysis specifically when we're
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
talking about reasonable accommodations
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
most often i think most folks understand
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
it coming up in the context of
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
ada requests or things of that nature
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's all under federal purview so i
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that that type of
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
analysis does not typically fall with us
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
saying that in practice i believe how
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
the department of labor in new hampshire
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
would interpret and apply this law would
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
be mainly that we see that there is now
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
a requirement
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
that if someone files one of these forms
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
it shall be granted it done does say
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
that the parties can work together we
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be looking to say okay it's
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable if the parties have agreed to
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
that because again the text of the uh
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
provided legislation says that uh the
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
employer may then work with the employee
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
to see if an agreement for a reasonable
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
accommodation can be reached essentially
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
i will tell you in practice i think what
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
we would do is we would say did the
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
parties come to an agreement if they
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
came to an agreement that works if they
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
didn't come to an agreement
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh and it led to termination
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
we would then probably look at that and
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
say okay
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
the exemption was then not fully or
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
granted in some form and i don't i don't
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
know if we're misinterpreting
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do here we would
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
look at this as saying employers
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
requiring this exemption shall be
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
granted meaning they should not require
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
it they can then try to work to some
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
type of accommodation
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
if they work to the accommodation and
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
agree to it fine if they don't
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
and then the person was terminated and
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
someone then complained to us we would
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
likely look and say okay
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
exemption not granted
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
employer you should grant that exemption
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
they would get 30 days because sitting
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
in 275 this would be under our general
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
penalty powers so there'd be 30 days for
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
the employer to correct it and namely
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
correction i imagine would be saying
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
you should have granted the exemption in
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
both you know form and you know actually
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
if they don't do it then
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
after the warning period expires the 30
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
days we would be able to impose a
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
penalty of up to 2 500 dollars um i see
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
it as more of a deterrence factor than
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
anything is we would say you're supposed
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
to do this if you don't do this you
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
should be penalized the only other thing
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
i would point out is this does not
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
clearly give us job restoration
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
authority um you know when it was talked
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
about wrongful terminations and things
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
of that nature that's not something that
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
comes to us or or is administered by us
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i just want to be clear that the
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
department's application of this law
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
would most likely be in the form of
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
deterrence saying you should be granting
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
this if you're not granting this you
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
could be penalized so i'm happy to take
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
questions and as you guys know it's not
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
us putting forth policy or in any way
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
trying to advise what should be done i
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that's how we
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
would interpret or apply this
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to be very clear on that
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation that's not
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
analysis we do so we would be looking
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
did the parties come to an agreement or
 
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.230 align:start position:0%
did the parties come to an agreement or
not

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take any questions thank
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
you anybody on committee representative
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner ogden
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
line 13 was
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad you brought it up would you
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
of a change that would clarify
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
an ongoing use of public funds for daily
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
operations or a one-time
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
or a segmented or relief fund or
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
something like that how would you
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the two
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
so that a
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
one-time grant to a
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
place of business that they don't become
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
automatically become a public employer
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
again i think there should perhaps be
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
clarity in terms of if you're looking
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
for one-time recipients to uh fall under
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
this i think you would want it to say
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
something akin to receives or has ever
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
received if you want it to be an ongoing
 
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
received if you want it to be an ongoing
thing

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
it should probably be clarified to say
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of regularly
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
receives or receives uh on a
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
schedule basis or something of that
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
nature i apologize i don't have the
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
words immediately at mine but i would
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
just suggest that you do perhaps look to
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
clarify that depending upon what the
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
intent is i don't know what the uh clear
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
intent is there if it's ever or ongoing
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you debbie
 
00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:47.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you debbie
commissioner

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
one question on that
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
the ongoing versus uh one time other
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
than can can you think of any
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
instances other than
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic can
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
are there any other instances you can
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
think of where there have been one time
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
mass influxes of
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
capital to businesses
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
um not off the top of my head but one i
 
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.549 align:start position:0%
um not off the top of my head but one i
mean

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the language here where it
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
talks about federal contracts i guess
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
one way to look if they ever
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
had done a federal contract or had ever
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
touched it but i'm not um i think covid
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
is unique in the sense of i think all of
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
a sudden there were a lot of businesses
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
um receiving an influx but i can't
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
think of many other examples so
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
 
00:33:48.399 --> 00:33:49.909 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
no

00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%

we
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition to the original
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
bill and we remain opposed to this bill
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
and i will outline for you why
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
how important
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
our medicaid and medicare funding is and
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
that in fact it would be in jeopardy if
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass it is in direct
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
violation of the cms requirements i am
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
happy to share with you some documents
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
from cms
 
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:47.349 align:start position:0%
from cms
but

00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
i know it was cha it's been challenged
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
and questioned um not in only in this
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee but other committees um
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
um whether or not
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
federal funding would be in violation
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
am happy to share with you but um
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's um one
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
faq which i think is very um informative
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to share it with you how
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
will this new requirement which is the
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement be enforced then
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
they talk about state surveys which are
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's a very pro it's a
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
very significant process that state
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
surveyors um in our case it's under
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
health facilities that they would be
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
surveying the um for compliance of
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
nursing homes not only private but also
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes as well as new
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and all hospitals and
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
anyone that's actually any facility that
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
falls under health facilities
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
how do the penalties work
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid certified
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
facilities are expected to comply with
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
all regulatory requirements and cms has
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
a variety of established enforcement
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
remedies for nursing homes
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
home health agencies hospice
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
this would include civil monetary
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
penalties denial of payment and even
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
termination from the medicare and
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid program as a final measure the
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
remedy for non-compliance among
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals and certain other acute and
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
continuing care providers is termination
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
however cms goal is to bring health care
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
facilities into compliance termination
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
would generally occur only after
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
providing a facility with the
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make corrections and come
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
into compliance that answers the
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
question about florida i've heard that
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
numerous times in numerous committees
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
florida has a law that is in
 
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.950 align:start position:0%
florida has a law that is in
direct

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
direct
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
conflict with cms federal requirements
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason probably nothing has
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
happened it's either the facilities are
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
already um following the cms
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
requirements and um or
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
they um they're just cms has not gone
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
into those facilities in florida but i
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
would contend that that is not something
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire wants to actually
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
challenge because that would put our
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals um in direct conflict and then
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
you're you have this this issue with
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
what the other is the other question
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
that continually comes up is well new
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire law would would supersede
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
federal law according to cms the the
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
answer is quite different what happens
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
if state law prohibits vaccine mandates
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
how does how can cms expect a facility
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
to follow its requirements if the state
 
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
to follow its requirements if the state
prevails

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
prevails
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
prevents them excuse me from
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
implementing this rule under the
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause of the u.s constitution
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
this regulation preempts any state law
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
to the contrary so that is directly from
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
cms in addition conscientious objection
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i will direct you to a letter and i
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
know david juve from the bia is here so
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to speak for him but he
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
wrote a very compelling letter to on
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
dated february 10th to this committee
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
relative to conscientious objection and
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
why it is not um
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
it should not be included relative to
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
this vaccine or
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah vaccine exemptions the hospitals
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i obviously represent hospitals so
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
hospitals have routinely and have for a
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
long time allowed for medical and
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions the right of
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
conscience is not contemplated never has
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
been and continues not to be and cms
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
does not allow for that conscientious
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
objection as the bia letter indicates is
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
is um is not contemplated um so that
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's another cms um violation the
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
other part where um you allow for a
 
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
other part where um you allow for a
simple

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
submit a request which is um as
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative lang said very simple the
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
pot the hospitals must have policies
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
relative to medical and religious
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions have forever um they've
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
allowed they've required flu vaccines
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
and other vaccines as i've i think my
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
testimony in prior um hearings have
 
00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:00.870 align:start position:0%
testimony in prior um hearings have
stated

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
they have a policy they have a very con
 
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.950 align:start position:0%
they have a policy they have a very con
very

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
significant process that they go through
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
for reviewing every medical and
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
so again um that
 
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.470 align:start position:0%
so again um that
that

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
line 20 um
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
just submitting a request and stating
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
that you have a conscientious objection
 
00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:23.430 align:start position:0%
that you have a conscientious objection
effectively

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
nullifies the entire vaccine
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
requirement because again that is not
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
you raise your hand and you say i object
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
um that that is not contemplated by cms
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
so so the hospitals cannot
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
cannot meet that requirement um the
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
shall again you cannot have a review and
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
render a fair and reasonable um review
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
and and process for the employee you
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
just shall be it shall be granted and
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
then the accommodations um i um i i've
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
heard this is stated for that it's
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
current business practice but um i would
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
um not i would contend that you can't
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
just re um
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
reallocate resources if you will if a
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
nurse if an icu nurse is on is unwilling
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
to follow this and and indicates they
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
want an accommodation
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
there are very
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
important considerations relative to
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
patients and their vulnerabilities i
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't care if they're if you are an icu
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
patient or if you're a podiatry patient
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
underlying health conditions you are at
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
risk and and our hospitals have contend
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
that that is not a risk that they are
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
willing to take so they that is why they
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
have put in this policy
 
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.910 align:start position:0%
have put in this policy
um

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
i mean it's restated again as
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative lang said under the
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
education relative to
 
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.910 align:start position:0%
education relative to
students

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i know there are others in the
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
audience that actually teach nursing
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
students so perhaps it would be best to
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
have them speak to this but
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
it is our understanding that the um the
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
nursing programs they have really not
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
had a problem relative to ensuring that
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
um those that go into a hospital for a
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
rotation are um following the the
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
requirements of that institution and
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
again everyone that's in a volunt then
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
again it's cms requirement volunteers
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
contractors employees unless you're 100
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
remote must follow the cms mandate and
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
when you have a student come in for a
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
rotation in a hospital
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
they are rotating throughout every
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
department including labor and delivery
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
so again unwilling the hospitals are
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
unwilling and will not put those
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
patients and and certainly those
 
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.430 align:start position:0%
patients and and certainly those
unvaccinated

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
newborns in in harm's way um i think
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's it for my comments happy to
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody have any questions
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
this bill does not specifically address
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
covid uh it more generally uh addresses
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines you're right can you
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
tell us how big a problem it would be if
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
someone refused to take any vaccinations
 
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
someone refused to take any vaccinations
whatsoever

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
that is a very um astute point and
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
you're right it's any vaccine um so
 
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.710 align:start position:0%
you're right it's any vaccine um so
again

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
currently um hospitals um and i probably
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
have it in my testimony there's a whole
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
list of um vaccinations inoculations
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
that are required i don't think it's in
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
this testimony but it was in another
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um so um
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's and again there's a nurse
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
sitting in the audience she knows pam um
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
dinopoly i think can can cite those but
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
there are a whole list of vaccinations
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
that are required as a condition of
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
employment pre-covered and continues to
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
be you're right those are also would be
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
in jeopardy um
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative lang thank you if i can
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
ask questions i'm looking at this bill
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
and we we're looking at potential you
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
know using this as a basis and maybe
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
mending so having inputs important
 
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.309 align:start position:0%
mending so having inputs important
um

00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is my intent to
 
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.670 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is my intent to
this

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill with the exception of the
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
new ad of right of conscience um
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
was to put into law basically current
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
procedures my understanding currently
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
that hospitals do allow for both medical
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions and they do if
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility of
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
of accommodations uh grant
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
accommodations is that not accurate
 
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.550 align:start position:0%
accommodations is that not accurate
um

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
that's that is accurate the
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection is the problem
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's the only only problem you have in
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
here is the right of conscience that
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
issue of adding the right of conscience
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.790 align:start position:0%
is that
so

00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
that is again one violation that would
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
be in direct
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
contradiction with cms so the right of
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
conscience is definitely an issue um the
 
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.550 align:start position:0%
conscience is definitely an issue um the
um

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
the written request shall shall simply
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
state like i said the policy is is
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise um there is a form and there's
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
a process that there's a policy and a
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
process so that is makes it a little
 
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.109 align:start position:0%
process so that is makes it a little
less

00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
and again this is also cms in indicates
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
this and then it says
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
such requests for exemption shall
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say may it says shall again
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
if you follow this
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
each word that indicates that you it
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what
 
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.309 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what
is

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
what the process is that you it shall be
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
granted if you put it if you sign a
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
piece of paper it shall be granted
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's the way i read it maybe that's
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
not your intent but that's the way i
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
read it so if i can follow up something
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out how i might
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
reword this to make it more palatable
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
for people
 
00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:01.589 align:start position:0%
for people
um

00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.670 align:start position:0%
so again
the

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
if anything what this law would do is
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
simplify the process rather than
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
complicate the process in that
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
you would not have to investigate
 
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.230 align:start position:0%
you would not have to investigate
medical

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
exemption requests you wouldn't have to
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
investigate religious you don't find out
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
what person what a person's religion is
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
what tenant of their faith is it that
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
requires them not to get the vaccine you
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to look at past practices of
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
the patient of the worker so this would
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
simplify that process dramatically for
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
the business would it not
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think it would actually make it more
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
challenging because um
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
you're again
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
what's the point if there is no due
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
process the employer owes that employee
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
due process if you just say i want a
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
medical re exemption and that shall be
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
granted that ex that exemption there is
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
no process so that's the problem i
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
understand what your concerns are but
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
again cms requirements actually do
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
require that you document it because
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
again the surveyors remember the
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
surveyors the hospitals are
 
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.109 align:start position:0%
surveyors the hospitals are
under

00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
cms survey
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
and they have to be ready at all times
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
so health facilities comes in and this
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
is a survey requirement they say what is
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
your policy
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
you have to give it to them and show me
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
what the process has been have you
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
treated employees fairly have you given
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
them that due process and if you did
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
what is outlined in this i appreciate
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be simpler it just
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in viola it would not be
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
surveyable if that's even a word you
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
could not the surveyor could not
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
check the box and say you met the cms
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
requirements you're now in jeopardy your
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
conditions of participation in medicare
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
and medicaid could be are in jeopardy
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
they could cite you and then again the
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
process as i outlined would start this
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
is this is
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
i know i heard representative infantine
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
say fear-mongering it's not it is this
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
is serious
 
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.589 align:start position:0%
is serious
sam

00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
sam
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
60 to 80 percent of hospitals
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is medicare and medicaid
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
60-80 80
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
in they would lose their cm their
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
federal and state funding this i am not
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
this is not fear-mongering i i promise
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
you it's not this is this is serious and
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's why the the
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
administration went to the supreme court
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
and asked for a ruling so that it could
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
be clear i also hear from other
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
legislators that don't think that it
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the final word but it is it's the
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
supreme court and no one is no other
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
lower court is
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
going into appealing that it is
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
cms mandate is
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
is being implemented it's just it's just
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
being implemented now that's why we're
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
not hearing from
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think i think the first state is
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
probably florida um but we we should not
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
we should not put those our hospitals in
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
all yours
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.109 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
question for you about i think we heard
 
00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:22.470 align:start position:0%
question for you about i think we heard
from

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh mr lavers in the unemployment section
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
a little while ago this committee did
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
about health care workers where their
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
exception was granted
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
but their employer made the
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
determination that no accommodation was
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
possible given the nature of their work
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
do you see this bill changing that
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh in any way that that that that
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
balancing could still be made where you
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their exemption as and
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
granted but still have to make the
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
determination of whether an
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
accommodation is possible under the
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances of their employment
 
00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.309 align:start position:0%
circumstances of their employment
i

00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i i'm remembering the
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
same testimony from
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
mr lavers but i
 
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.589 align:start position:0%
mr lavers but i
believe

00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
employment security was talking about
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
those that were not granted an
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
exemption and went to employment
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
security looking for unemployment
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
benefits and his statistics indicated
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the i can't remember i i have it
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
written down somewhere that out of 90 um
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
80 were upheld or whatever i i i
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even state the stats but i
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding is they were
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
challenged they wanted unemployment
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
benefits because they
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
they they left employment
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
because their exemption was not granted
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not um but i apologize i don't i
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
don't i think i'm might be remembering a
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
different um testimony i'm not sure
 
00:49:47.839 --> 00:49:49.270 align:start position:0%
different um testimony i'm not sure
representative

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you actually it was the inverse
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
of that i think it was something like
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
90 were denied and i think you're
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
talking about that 90 was denied i think
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
that but the 10 percent that were
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
granted i believe were employers that
 
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
granted i believe were employers that
acknowledged

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledged
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
and accepted either their medical or
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
religious exemption as valid
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
but then found through the circumstances
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
their employment
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
there was no possible way to accommodate
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
them in this situation and that was the
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
minority that was their unemployment was
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
granted and paid oh okay thank you thank
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
you that's that's the group i was asking
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
about okay and whether this would change
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
any existing practice because i think it
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
it would short circuit the first step
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
with the exception and the the exemption
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
would be acknowledged as granted but i
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't think that the intent of this bill
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
is to short circus that secondary
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
investigation of whether an
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
accommodation is possible given the
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the work and i was
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you saw it differently
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
than what i just said or not i guess
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
question if
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
if this is current law why do we need
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
this because if the the employer may
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
then work with the employee to see if an
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
agreement for a reasonable accommodation
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
can be reached
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
and like you said i think that's what
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
they try to do
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
if um the um exemption is granted and um
 
00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.470 align:start position:0%
if um the um exemption is granted and um
and

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then they try to accommodate or yeah
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so that like you said that minority
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
piece probably a good idea to have mr
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
lavers come back and talk about that um
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
but again if they're they're already
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
making accommodations so i'm not sure
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
why we would need that stated in law i
 
00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:31.589 align:start position:0%
why we would need that stated in law i
guess

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative bouchard
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering of course
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
when you read this bill
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
do you interpret it
 
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
do you interpret it
that

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
anybody can walk in an employee
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
to the employer and say
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
i do not want to be vaccinated
 
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.470 align:start position:0%
i do not want to be vaccinated
and

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's because of
 
00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:57.910 align:start position:0%
it's because of
religion

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
religion
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
or medical
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
or conscientious and then you have to
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
grant it
 
00:52:03.839 --> 00:52:04.630 align:start position:0%
grant it
yes

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative bouchard that's how i
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
interpret it it is an automatic um
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
because of the shall be granted um and
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is of course when
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
if they require a vaccination
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
requirement and
 
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.829 align:start position:0%
requirement and
yes

00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
how is that different from
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
what's happening now
 
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.710 align:start position:0%
what's happening now
so

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the hospitals have a
 
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.870 align:start position:0%
the hospitals have a
requirement

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
they impose the requirements starting in
 
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
they impose the requirements starting in
august

00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
august
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
long before
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
came down with their cms
 
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.670 align:start position:0%
came down with their cms
requirement

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
so they determined that based on the
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
safety of patients and their employees
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
and because of the nature of the work
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
that they do that they needed to impose
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
these vaccination requirements for covid
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
before that again there's a whole litany
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
of other require employee employment
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
related vaccinations that hospitals have
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
imposed for years
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know flu vaccine is is the most
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
common but there are a whole bunch of
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
them mmr and a whole bunch of um
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
i think well again um there's a list i
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
have it written and i'm happy to share
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
it with you
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.309 align:start position:0%
um so
they

00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
require it and if someone were to say i
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
cannot get the flu vaccine i because i'm
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
allergic to
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
what's in the flu vaccine for instance
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
um and my so they would they would
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
request a medical
 
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.470 align:start position:0%
request a medical
exemption

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a policy a written policy
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then you fill out a form and then it
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
goes to a committee um with clinicians
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
at the hospital and they review that
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and it's a signed document from the
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
patient from the patient's physician or
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
provider stating why they cannot have
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
then the then that's reviewed and if
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's accommodated then um
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
if it's agreed sorry if it's accepted
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
then the accommodation may be full ppe
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
um you know prior to to covet we weren't
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
all wearing masks but the hospitals um
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
during flu flu season they certainly do
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
um but they might have to wear um
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
additional protection because of the um
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know how how highly contagious the
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
flu virus is
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
so um that's what would happen they
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
would make an accommodation like that so
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
during flu season
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
you must wear a mask if you or other ppe
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
if you are not
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
able to get the flu vaccine did i answer
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
your question thank you okay you're
 
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.470 align:start position:0%
your question thank you okay you're
welcome

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
i have a series of questions for you
 
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.309 align:start position:0%
i have a series of questions for you
sure

00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
the last one you just uh the comment you
 
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:52.950 align:start position:0%
the last one you just uh the comment you
made

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think actually plays to what uh
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative lang's trying to do here
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
you just said that reasonable
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
accommodation is made for the flu on an
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
annual basis by
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
requiring the individual to wear a mask
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
or some other thing i mean uh
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it some of my other
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
comments go to
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
covert versus everything else we've ever
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with and
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
you're the reason we're seeing a lot of
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
this stuff is because of that
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
um first question
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
well let's start from the back forward
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned um when we were talking
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
about the conscientious objection versus
 
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.870 align:start position:0%
about the conscientious objection versus
religious

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give you example
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative huff here we work for the
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
same company
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what it is
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
he submits a religious
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
he submits a religious exemption
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i submit a relig uh
 
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.670 align:start position:0%
and i submit a relig uh
an

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector or whatever the
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
wording is in here
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
because i can't truthfully
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
what is the difference
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
net outcome
 
00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:06.230 align:start position:0%
net outcome
between

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
when he is granted his exemption and i'm
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
not in your
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
bus not in in the nursing or hospital or
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
that but in general what's in that
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
effect is there any difference in the
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
outcome of
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative huff and myself
 
00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.589 align:start position:0%
representative huff and myself
mike

00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
mike
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
so the policy
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
again i can't speak for other employers
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
but for hospitals they allow for medical
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions so you go
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
through the process and then
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative huff's um religious
 
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.349 align:start position:0%
representative huff's um religious
exemption

00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
would be considered by the committee and
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
either granted or not granted and then
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's communicated let's get way beyond
 
00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:45.109 align:start position:0%
that's communicated let's get way beyond
that

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've already gotten through all of this
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there any difference in
 
00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.109 align:start position:0%
is there any difference in
how

00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
either one of us are going to be handled
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
the conscientious objection is not a is
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
not on the list i understand that i'm
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
saying under this bill if it passes what
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be the difference
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
between how he is handled and i'm
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
handled the hospital would be in direct
 
00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:14.710 align:start position:0%
handled the hospital would be in direct
um

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get it away from the
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
hospital scene because this but i
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
represent hospitals so so maybe it'd be
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
better for david somebody else okay uh
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the very beginning you
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
were reading some faqs from cms what
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
date were those put out they were put
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
out they were updated hold on i and
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
again i'm happy to send this
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
they were new
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
some of them were were new in um
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%

2022.
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
they were new a couple weeks ago
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that you read were new on the
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
22nd um they were initially
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
issued on november 5th 2021
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
and have been updated as of january 20th

2022.
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and the title is um faq you could
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually look this up um if you wanted
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
and googled it um cms omnibus covid19
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare staff vaccination interim
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
final rule and it's the external faqs
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
and it's 15 pages long again i'm happy
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
to send this but i didn't want to bog
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
what percentage of your hospital workers
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
or the people you represent took the
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
took the job voluntarily
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
how many resigned because they refused
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
and how many what percent were actually
 
00:58:47.119 --> 00:58:48.390 align:start position:0%
and how many what percent were actually
terminated

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
terminated
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't have those numbers right in
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
front of me but i would say um
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
well the hospitals aren't required to
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
report that so i we just have anecdotal
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
information but um some have actually
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
come out um dartmouth hitchcock
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
did a press release that they had over
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh well over 90 95
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
um of their employees are vaccinated or
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
have um received an exemption um so
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
i i can try and get some of that
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
information it's completely anecdotal
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
nothing is required to be submitted and
 
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.349 align:start position:0%
nothing is required to be submitted and
then

00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
employment security as representative um
 
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.390 align:start position:0%
employment security as representative um
um

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
was saying um
 
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.150 align:start position:0%
was saying um
mr represe

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
mr represe
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
i think is best to answer the question
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
about um those that were fired and um
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
or were let go and then were went to
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
employment security and went through
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
that process so
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
i don't have those actual numbers but i
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
can i can see what i can get but
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
what has been reported by hospitals is
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
well over 90 95 of their employees
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
actually higher than 90. uh 95 plus
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
are either fully vaccinated or um have
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
i understand that number but that
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't really get to the heart of what
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get at and that is how
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
many took it voluntarily and said yay i
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
want to take this
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh jab how many were forced to take it
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
under threat of losing their jobs
 
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.190 align:start position:0%
under threat of losing their jobs
and

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh how many were actually terminated
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
because they refuse again i'll use my
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
company as an example we started off
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
with about 25 of our pilots who said i'm
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
not going to do it
 
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
not going to do it
they

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
president biden put in his federal
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
contractor mandate and under the threat
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
of termination
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of them ended up getting it our
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
company can now come out and say with
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
the same statistics you just said
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
95 of our company has
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh either received an exemption
 
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.109 align:start position:0%
uh either received an exemption
or

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
has had the vaccine five percent of us
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
have done nothing didn't request we
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
didn't get the vaccine
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
so but that number at 95 percent does
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
not speak to how many did it only under
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
the threat of losing their job and i can
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
tell you in terms of the pilots it was
 
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.789 align:start position:0%
tell you in terms of the pilots it was
probably

01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know 1500
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
1500 under the threat of their job and
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
we can go into anecdotals and how many
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
of our pilots have passed away due to
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know immediately following the the
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
implementation of the taking the backs
 
01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.150 align:start position:0%
implementation of the taking the backs
but

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
but
so

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
the the numbers i'm looking for is how
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
many people are actually saying yay i
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
want to take this experimental
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
drug where the uh it's not experimental
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
but um that i think we'll agree to
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
disagree on that but it's not
 
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.829 align:start position:0%
disagree on that but it's not
experimental

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
experimental
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
um it's fully approved by the fda
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have those numbers
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative um so i don't i don't
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
know that i'll be able to um
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
satisfy your your question um the vast
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
vast majority of healthcare workers
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
support the vaccination and and
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
willingly had that um had that
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
they chose to do it um they were not
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um they did it well before their
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
employer um ever imposed um the
 
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.589 align:start position:0%
employer um ever imposed um the
requirement

01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other question mr
 
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other question mr
chair

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
i want to restate one of your questions
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
i think i can get the right answer i i i
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
think the question the chair was trying
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
to get to earlier about accommodations
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
was if you
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
assuming this law went into effect and
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
you had to grant an exemption and create
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
a reasonable accommodation for those
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
three categories whether it's medical
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
religious or conscientious objector
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
would the accommodation be different
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
based on the the reason they chose the
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
exemption or is it
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
i that's a hypothetical that i can't
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
answer because again that's not what the
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
hospital's policy is now
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't know
 
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.309 align:start position:0%
so i don't know
again

01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
relevant i guess i don't know if that's
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
the right word what's more
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
concerning is that they would be in
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
direct violation of cms that's cms
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
requirements so they cannot
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
make that accommodation without risk of
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
losing federal funding that's the
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
concern one more follow-up let's go back
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
to just the cms rules then so if you had
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
a medical exemption a religious
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
exemption employee and your goal is the
 
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
safety of the
 
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.309 align:start position:0%
safety of the
patient

01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
in the hospital
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
you had said that they would be required
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
to mask or wear full gown ppe but that
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
exemption would that that accommodation
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be different it's
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
you're giving the exemption because of
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're not taking the vaccine so
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
therefore the accommodation should be
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps i i don't know what the
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
accommodation is but if you're
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated and you're treating
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
patients i would believe again the
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals have policies and they do
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
they they would have to
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
make sure again that the patients are
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
fully um protected um as and other staff
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so so i think what you said was that
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
an unvaccinated person is treated the
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
same as it relates to accommodations
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
whether regardless of the status the
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
reason for the reason of the
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
unvaccination is i i don't i don't have
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
specifics but i it makes it certainly
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan did you have
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
anything no good
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
anything else from miss minihan
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anybody else in the
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
audience like to talk
 
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.069 align:start position:0%
audience like to talk
okay

01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah come on up and then uh
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
david giuve will be next and then
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
whoever else
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
can you turn on your mic please
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
pam dinapoli i'm a nurse and i taught at
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
unh for 20 years in the department of
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
nursing and now the executive director
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire nurses association
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
and i just i understand this is a labor
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee but i think that
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
you have to talk about human costs and i
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
think the representative's comment about
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
this applies to all vaccines is really
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
an important point and the issue with
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
conscience objector is that it broadens
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
the exemption so anybody and we've seen
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
this over time so we've seen what
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines have done in terms of disease
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
so we have a period where
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
within the last 10 years there was a lot
 
01:05:23.359 --> 01:05:24.230 align:start position:0%
within the last 10 years there was a lot
of

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
disinformation about
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines causing autism and other things
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
and there were more people requesting
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions and at that time we saw an
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
increase in communicable diseases so we
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
know that vaccines work and we want to
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
limit the number of people who can claim
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
an exemption because as we broaden it
 
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.190 align:start position:0%
an exemption because as we broaden it
out

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
so now you don't need to have your mmr
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
because you don't want it for your
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
children so now we have a measles
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
outbreak in the city of manchester so
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
then you have to figure out who's
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated who's not vaccinated so it
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
puts the human cost of
 
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.309 align:start position:0%
puts the human cost of
eliminating

01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
a vaccine requirement is huge to
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
a community to the health care
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
profession and to to the population in
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
general so i just think that the problem
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
with this bill is broadening the
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
exemptions and just remember
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we're in a cove at times we're
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
talking as if this is just about cove
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
this is about human disease and we know
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
what vaccines have done to decrease
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases so i think this is
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
a scary bill
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
from a health perspective and i think
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
from a labor perspective there's a lot
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
of cost to to human capital so i just
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
want you to consider that when you're
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
cms costs this is really human costs
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about and in terms of
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education none of our
 
01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.549 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education none of our
students

01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
cared whether or not they had to get the
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
vaccine they wanted their life to be
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
back so they line up for vaccines all of
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
our nursing students have had to have
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines to come into the program
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
for 20 years so you know the whole issue
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
that that they're going to be
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
that that they don't want to take it
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
then that impacts their clinical
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
experiences and that's always been the
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
case so you know and hospitals consider
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
medical and religious exemptions very
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
carefully so everybody gets due process
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
so you know i think that that you don't
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
want to open this up to to raise your
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
hand and say i don't want a vaccine it's
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
mr chair can i just make one comment
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely so you know we talk a lot
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
about the right of conscience and again
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to i'm literally on
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
the hhs.gov federal website and when it
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
talks about health care providers and
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
their right of conscience
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
is that specifically written right into
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
the law under conscience and religious
 
01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.190 align:start position:0%
the law under conscience and religious
freedom

01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:01.750 align:start position:0%
it says
con

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
con
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
conscience protections apply to health
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
care providers before who refuse to
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
perform accommodate or assist
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh with certain health care services on
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
religious or moral grounds federal
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
statutes protect health care providers
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
conscious rights to prohibit recipients
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
of certain federal funds from
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
discriminating against health care
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
providers or refuse to participate in
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
these services based on moral objections
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
and religious beliefs so we extend this
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
right of conscience to health care
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
providers that we have the same health
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
care providers refusing to extend those
 
01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:32.789 align:start position:0%
care providers refusing to extend those
same

01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
privileges they have to our citizens and
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
i just find that hypocritical
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
mr du jouve how are you thank you
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte mr chair members
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee for the record my
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
name is dave giuve i'm a senior vice
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
president for public policy with the
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
business and industry association
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
we serve as new hampshire statewide
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce we have over 400
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
employer members with over 80 000
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
employees in the state i primarily just
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to some questions that
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
came up that i felt
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
there was still some vagueness as to the
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
answer and i'd like to start with
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative lang you were
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
asking about reasonable accommodations
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
and whether it would differ
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
depending on the
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
exemption that was being taken if i
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that correctly my belief is
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
it would not differ a reasonable
 
01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.510 align:start position:0%
it would not differ a reasonable
accommodation

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
is a either a verbal or written
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
agreement between the employer and the
 
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
agreement between the employer and the
employee

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
for the and it relates directly to the
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
employee's ability to do the job so
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
whether they
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
chose a religious exemption or a medical
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
exemption or this new conscientious
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
objector exemption i don't believe that
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
would be a part of the discussion
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the employee
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
about their ability to do the job
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte you were asking
 
01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.189 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte you were asking
if

01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
from a practical point of view or from
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
the employer point of view does it make
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
any difference whether
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's a medical exemption or a
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection
 
01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection
exemption

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess my response would be for
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
some employers
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
who are not actually it was
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh conscientious versus
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
religion okay yeah thank you for
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
correcting me
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
for some employers and i'm going to talk
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
about employers who are not a part of
 
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.189 align:start position:0%
about employers who are not a part of
the

01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
the cms mandate because i do agree with
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
paula that those employers are under um
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
stricter rules than than other employers
 
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
stricter rules than than other employers
so

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
most i shouldn't say most some employers
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
if a if a religious
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
or medical exemption is requested or a
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
new conscientious objection if this
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill is passed
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
take it any further they will just grant
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
it so in that case there would be no
 
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
it so in that case there would be no
difference

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
other employers handle it differently
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they do and there is a process an
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
in-house process where they will try and
 
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.189 align:start position:0%
in-house process where they will try and
evaluate

01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
that exemption being requested the
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
medical exemption is fairly
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
straightforward um
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's not 100 fool proof but it's fairly
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
straightforward they check with you know
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
the individual's doctor and you know you
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
can come to a pretty quick determination
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption is a little bit
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
vaguer and a little bit
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
more difficult for an employer to engage
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
in a discussion on because obviously
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
part of an individual's life
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
however some employers will
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
at least a conversation to take place
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
what is it about your
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
religious that would not
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
allow you to feel like you could take a
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine and that individual would have
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
to respond
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the response is so there is
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
some level of discussion that takes
 
01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.350 align:start position:0%
some level of discussion that takes
place

01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see how you could have any
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
discussion about a conscientious
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
objection other than i just want to make
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
sure you have a conscientious objection
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
check mark it off so there is a subtle
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
religious and conscientious objection
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
discussions that take place for those
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
employers that want to have the
 
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.870 align:start position:0%
employers that want to have the
discussion

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
it seems like there might have been
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
another question asked but those are the
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
two that are at my top of mind but i'm
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any other
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
questions i i do want to
 
01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:41.669 align:start position:0%
questions i i do want to
emphasize

01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
emphasize
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
um it i guess i should also say that
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
that representative lang and myself and
 
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.430 align:start position:0%
that representative lang and myself and
two

01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
very savvy very experienced federal
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
labor law attorneys had a conversation
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
it was cordial i thought it was very
 
01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.669 align:start position:0%
it was cordial i thought it was very
respectful

01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
respectful
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
but we did come to different conclusions
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
about whether the federal government
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
would recognize a conscientious
 
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.270 align:start position:0%
would recognize a conscientious
objection

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
exemption and whether the federal
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
government requires some documentation
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
on the the part of the employer
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
we both believe we have the
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
research to back up where we are at but
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
we differ on that
 
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
we differ on that
opinion

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
in any event i'm happy to try and answer
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
you described under the religious and
 
01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.229 align:start position:0%
you described under the religious and
medical

01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
exemptions the process that employers go
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
through but some employers go through
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
would you agree that under the language
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill those procedures would be
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
eliminated because all they have to do
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
is sign a piece of paper saying i have a
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
medical objection i have
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
a medical i
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
need a medical exemption i need a
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
religious exemption or i need a
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection um and that's it
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
i i would agree with your analysis of
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
the bill that would render those types
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
of uh conversations irrelevant the
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
employer is required to grant the
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
exemption upon the request not not only
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
not only irrelevant but um
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
well i mean from
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
i i suppose i would answer yes but from
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
an employer perspective if there's
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
if there's no point in having the
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
conversation because of what the law is
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have the
 
01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have the
conversation

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
i do remember what the other issue was
 
01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.470 align:start position:0%
i do remember what the other issue was
mr

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
mr
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
chair and you had asked about
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
companies how many
 
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.270 align:start position:0%
companies how many
people

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
how many how many unvaccinated employees
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
in companies if you can sort of
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
suss out how many got the vaccination
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
because they were forced to
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
i only have anecdotal information on
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
that but it's but it's pretty good
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information at the point last
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
fall where the um
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
presidential executive order required
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
private sector employees of a hundred
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
and more to require vaccinations
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
we heard from
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
a number of our manufacturing members
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
that they were very concerned about this
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
mandate uh because they estimated they
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
would lose 20 to 25 percent of their
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
employees now that was before the
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
mandate was implemented so there was no
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have mandates in their
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
workplace so there's no reason to
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
believe anyone had been forced to take a
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
vaccination but their estimate in
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
and this is by the way consistent with
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
talked to me around the state they
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
estimated 20 to 25 percent of their
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
employees would be lost
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that would go almost
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh exactly in line with my personal
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
situation with our pilots it was about
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
the about the same percentage
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
now i guess i should balance that and i
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
know this wasn't what you were asking we
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
had other employers
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
of a hundred or more who
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
actually implemented the vaccine mandate
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
before it went into effect
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
and so there were some employees
 
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.229 align:start position:0%
and so there were some employees
uh

01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
faced that vaccination perhaps
 
01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
faced that vaccination perhaps
unwillingly

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
unwillingly
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
and those employers reported that there
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
was some resistance in some grumbling
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
but more often than not people chose to
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine rather than lose their
 
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.149 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine rather than lose their
job

01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
key point let me ask you something on
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the religious uh
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
religious exemption versus the
 
01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:44.310 align:start position:0%
religious exemption versus the
conscientious

01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
conscientious
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh exemption
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
if there's any individual who can't
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
but that can that person still be
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
certainly i probably fall into that
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
category myself as would i so
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's one of the points i was trying to
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
get asked before is what is the net
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
effect difference of a person who claims
 
01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.830 align:start position:0%
effect difference of a person who claims
a

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh religious exemption versus
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
a religion uh conscientious objection
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we understand the how the bill is
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
written i get all that
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
but i've yet to see
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
hear anybody who's opposed to this say
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the net effect on the individual
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
i guess i would suggest that
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to go down that road you
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
could simplify this bill by just saying
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh private sector employers or
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
educational institutions that accept
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
federal and state uh
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
money are prohibited from implementing
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates and just leave it at
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
that because the reality is
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between what is
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
commonly accepted as a religious
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
exemption where an employer has the
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
right to
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
query about that and a conscientious
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
objection where there's no query that
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay we're getting a little
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
philosophical here but again
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to my personal case
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
because that's what i know when they
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
came out with these the federal
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
contractor mandates and i was given the
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
choice of
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
get a medical
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
or get a religious exemption
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
and our company was pushing it just do
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
it do it do it
 
01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.430 align:start position:0%
it do it do it
right

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'm healthy i couldn't claim a medical
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
i couldn't claim truthfully or religious
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
well just go put one no i'm not going to
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
i need that other category personally
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
because i don't fall into that
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
religious or medical
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
so i think that's the importance of
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
it makes sense but it also renders any
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because there is no band-aid
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
if a person just says i don't want to
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
get it that there's no mandate that
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
takes place
 
01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.550 align:start position:0%
takes place
exactly

01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else just a chair yes
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
so just one thing into this point you're
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
talking about conscientious objector
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
versus religious and probably an
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
interesting statistic is
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is considered the top
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
non-religious state in the entire
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
country a lot of people consider
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
themselves spiritual but don't consider
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
themselves religious and and to a point
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
where you run into some problems with
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption and claiming one
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use catholicism as a great
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
example is that the catholic church has
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
come out and said
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to get the vaccine the
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines it's okay but also we recognize
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
that there could be some moral religious
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions relative to the stem cell
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
research that's behind it so we also
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
agree that if you don't want to get it
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's okay too so where does that
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
person fall is it really a religious
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
exemption when the church says yes you
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
can but also says no you can't how do i
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
how do you claim i'm not going to get it
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
because the church hasn't taken a
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
position so i don't know how this is
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
where conscious objector falls in or the
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
right of conscience falls in and says
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
well my church doesn't explicitly
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
prohibit me from getting the vaccine i
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
have a moral belief that i should not
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
get it because it's based on stem cell
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
research and this is why the right of
 
01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
research and this is why the right of
conscience

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
is so important yeah i would
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree at the point
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
i was with you up until the point where
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
you said
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
my church or my religion has said
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
i can get the vaccine if i want to
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
however i also as a part of my religion
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
have strong feelings about stem cell
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
research and my
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
in my church has
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
made me aware of that also i would think
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
that would be for most employers a
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
two questions for representative lange
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
if you have a moment um
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
do you know when the conscientious right
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
of conscience was added to the new
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
i will say the first time it was used
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
conscience objector most people equate
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
it with law
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
with war and the right to the conscious
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
objective right now bear arms it was
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
actually that's not true the first time
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
it was used was relative of the vaccines
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
in england
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
in 1895
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it was the in in england they had a
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccine requirement prior to
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
that in 1888 i think they put it in
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
there was so much objection that they
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
put another law in that granted the
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
right of conscience to people to not get
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that was in 1895. um to
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
answer your question about the right of
 
01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.350 align:start position:0%
answer your question about the right of
conscience

01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
june 2nd 1784.
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that sounds like it was part of the
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah june 2nd 1784. that sounds like it
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
was part of the original draft um
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
do you think that what we're talking
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
about the difference between a
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection a religious
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
exemption is
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
just a difference in you know the modern
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
way we've evolved and viewing it as
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to how they viewed it back then
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
and back then as they were trying to
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
talk about it conscience objection and
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
weren't as clearly delineated and were
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
really the same thing they were trying
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about is that do you think
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overlap there or not
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
again i'm not a historical expert by i
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
do know that again based a lot of my
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
readings that again a lot of the
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
founders were deities types that
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
believed in some sort of spiritual being
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
but didn't necessarily believe in a lot
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
of religion you know religious you know
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
specific churches so to speak so i think
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
they were recognizing the fact that
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
there is a there are there's morality
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
and there's religiousness and that those
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
two things can be the same can also be
 
01:22:58.639 --> 01:22:59.830 align:start position:0%
two things can be the same can also be
separate

01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i could make one more
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
comment since the subject about
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
conscientious objections that come up in
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
line six
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
where it says the state of new hampshire
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
has affirmed in statute the natural
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent right to
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
individual bodily integrity
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
i am sure that's true but the state of
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has also affirmed in
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
statute the right of employers
 
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
statute the right of employers
to

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
implement health and safety regulations
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
in their workplace for example
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
you can't
well

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
for most places of employment
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
if you show up
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
work high as a kite from smoking
 
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.189 align:start position:0%
work high as a kite from smoking
marijuana

01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
you won't be prohibited you won't be
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to do your job and you may be
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
subject to discipline the same holds
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
true for drinking
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh again those
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
by this i think would be natural
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
essential or inherent rights of
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
individuals or to right to individual
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
body integrity and yet
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
we do have in statute the ability for
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
i would not disagree
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
i will make the point that legislative
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else for mr juve
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
my name is kate fry i'm from new futures
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not in front of this committee very
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
often um but we are a public health
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
organization that works on public health
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
policies and the health and wellness of
 
01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents and i'll be very
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
brief i just did want to underscore a
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
little uh what pam dinopoli said so well
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
is i think one of the
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
issues here is really understanding the
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
public health importance of vaccines and
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
i'm particularly concerned with the part
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill that focuses on colleges and
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
universities and just offering a
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
conscientious exemption
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
on all vaccines
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
most colleges
 
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.950 align:start position:0%
most colleges
require

01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine and meningitis
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
meningical meningitis vaccines hepatitis
 
01:25:31.679 --> 01:25:32.390 align:start position:0%
meningical meningitis vaccines hepatitis
b

01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
b
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
and this is really understanding the
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
college nature and i just sent my
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
last child to college and you know how
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
close um
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
kids are on campus and sharing a room
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
and i i can testify to that my husband
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i had to take turns in and out of
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
their tiny room we really have to
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
understand that environment to
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of these
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines and
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's well noted that any time you offer
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
conscientious or philosophical it's
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
usually called personal exemption
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
anytime you offer that the rates of
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinations just go down and you do
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
start to see the outbreak of diseases
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
for those of you that
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know don't know but meningitis is a
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
very real concern on college campuses
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
and the outbreaks are almost always
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
deadly so i just think we really need to
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
be aware of this and when we talk about
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
conscientious we have to understand that
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are people who can't get vaccines
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
for medical reasons and no one has the
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
right to infect other people
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
and it just it really we have to keep
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
that in mind that these diseases are
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
deadly and they can be in most cases
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
they've been completely eradicated but
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
once we bring down that firewall
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
we will start to see increase outbreaks
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
i just have one you mentioned meningitis
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't know the answer is that a
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
required vaccine it is required at most
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
universities and i did just check before
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
it came up it is required at unh um now
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's almost always required since that
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine has been approved and i will say
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
most universities and colleges have um
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
also mandated the covet vaccine and i
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
know both my daughters were thrilled to
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
be able to get that vaccine and hope for
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
life back to normal at college
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh the meningitis vaccine once that is
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
taken does that
 
01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.550 align:start position:0%
taken does that
prevent

01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
that individuals from getting that
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a very foolproof vaccine i
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
mean there's a no vaccine is a hundred
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
percent but it's um made a huge
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
difference in outbreaks uh in colleges
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
and universities and i can get you more
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
information on that and as far as covid
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
is that a foolproof vaccine like
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
meningitis vaccine um i you know i think
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're still learning about covid and the
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
different it's a little bit different
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
because we've had so many variants
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
um but again going back to this bill
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's not just covet it's all vaccines so
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
we should be concerned about that thank
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
you anybody else
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
if i may yes just an interesting fact
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
point that i think is important to this
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
discussion especially now that we're on
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
the topic of schools
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
was you know
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to vaccinations one of the
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
big questions around herd immunity right
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the for public health purposes herd
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
immunity is important to make sure we
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
reach hurt immunity hurt immunities
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
established at a baseline of 70 that was
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
the number that that is generally said
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's the baseline of of where herd
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
immunity begins and it gets better with
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
as your percentage increase would
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
anybody care to has their guess what the
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of inoculations are and
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are in our public school
 
01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.350 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are in our public school
system

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
even given we allow that we allow for
 
01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.950 align:start position:0%
even given we allow that we allow for
exemptions

01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.790 align:start position:0%
exemptions
94

01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
94
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
right 94 of the students have agreed to
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated the parents have agreed
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated so we're well beyond
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
the hurt immunity so sometimes we talk
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
about this public health concern we
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
recognize that
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
we heard from mr duvet you know 80 to 95
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
95 percent of their employees chose to
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine so we're not talking
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
about a herd immunity problem here right
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the fact that
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
we're not mass outbreaks nobody's ever
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to get it the reality is that new
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire well before covert and well
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
before these had a one of the top
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
nations for people just choosing to get
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine what we're recognizing here is
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
that has an objection for one reason
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's a small minority of our of our
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
population but it's still a population
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
that deserves protection so that's what
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about thank you
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none any other
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
some

01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.470 align:start position:0%
some
comments

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
i don't care for this bill um i don't
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
intend to support this bill
 
01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.070 align:start position:0%
intend to support this bill
um

01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
there are limits on rights
 
01:30:00.639 --> 01:30:01.910 align:start position:0%
there are limits on rights
um

01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
for example we all know you can't
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
yell fire in the uh movie house
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
um that's a limit on the first amendment
 
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.110 align:start position:0%
um that's a limit on the first amendment
rights

01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.550 align:start position:0%
rights
um

01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that um
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
crying fire or refusing to get a
 
01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.830 align:start position:0%
crying fire or refusing to get a
mandated

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination in a medical facility ought
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
to be an exception
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
i would say the same for
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
a college
 
01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.070 align:start position:0%
a college
environment

01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
same for a county nursing home
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
and and same as well for state or
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
federal um
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
um or county
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
so i would suggest that
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
although i don't support this bill in
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
any form
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
it could be improved by carving out some
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
exceptions for those categories
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
those categories that we've received a
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
lot of uh
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
testimony about
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
especially the medical if we're only
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to choose one the medical one is a
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
critical one because of the
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
the medicare and medicaid aspect
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
i think this bill could be vastly
 
01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:14.229 align:start position:0%
i think this bill could be vastly
improved

01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
improved
 
01:31:14.239 --> 01:31:15.189 align:start position:0%
improved
by

01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
making sure that um
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
these conditions do not apply
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
to medical related employment
 
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
to medical related employment
um

01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
if the committee is interested i would
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
be willing to uh
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
try to put together a new amendment to
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
that effect again i probably still
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support it but it would be
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
better than what we have now
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative avilani
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would just want
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
clarification on the public funding
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in uh line
 
01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.070 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in uh line
13

01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
13
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
one time versus ongoing and that kind of
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
thing yeah
 
01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.350 align:start position:0%
thing yeah
okay

01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay see no more uh comments or
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
questions i guess what we sh
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative avalany
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
just a question for representative lang
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
if it's appropriate absolutely
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative lang could the
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
under the medical exemption
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
could that include
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
the right of of conscious exemption so
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have a third leg so we could
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
actually expand the definition of a
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry can you receive the question i
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you
 
01:32:40.159 --> 01:32:41.189 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you
medical

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
given that doctors have the right of
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
conscience exemption could we expand the
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
definition of a medical exemption under
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
the medical exemptions are governed by
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
the ada by ada
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
as a general rule of thumb um so i'm not
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
sure that we could expand medical
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
exemptions to include the right of
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
conscience if that's what you're asking
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct we has that has that
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
been flushed out at all
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
if it could be expanded
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
under the medical exemption to include
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
right of conscience correct yeah again
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
right the medical exemption and maybe
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
someone mr duvet may have a better
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
answer that but my understanding is
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
medical the medical exemptions are
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
driven by
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
the ada law the religious exemptions are
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
driven by the civil rights act law
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
and conscience objections are driven by
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:46.910 align:start position:0%
okay so coming out of the subcommittee
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:48.310 align:start position:0%
okay so coming out of the subcommittee
[Music]

01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
i guess we will take a
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
vote on recommendation uh whether or not
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment proceed or we recommend
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
it when we get back to full committee
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
um i know we've talked about uh
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative avalani
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
has talked about the
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
wording in line 13 i'm thinking we can
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that before we bring an
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to the
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
full committee if we do that
 
01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.470 align:start position:0%
full committee if we do that
so

01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
secretary to
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
take a vote i guess or call a roll call
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
vote on a recommendation to proceed
 
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
vote on a recommendation to proceed
yes

01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes so this will be for a recommendation
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
to proceed
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
before you do that i want to make one
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
we need to recognize that
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
there is a severability cause in this in
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
and i think it's fair to say that the
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
ultimate determination on a lot of this
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
stuff regarding covet is still in the
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
courts the supreme court has
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
heard arguments they've
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
placed a lot of their decisions back on
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
the federal courts so a lot of this
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
stuff is still yet to be settled and
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
it'll probably be a while before it is
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
and the reason we're going through a lot
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
of this is because i think of the
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
covet itself and all the things that
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
have happened so
 
01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.590 align:start position:0%
have happened so
um

01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'll call it roll
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
represent sullivan i would just want to
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
point out i hear what you're saying
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
about the severability i think it's good
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's in there
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
however with the cms questions and
 
01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.590 align:start position:0%
however with the cms questions and
concerns

01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
no one says we have to take uh funding
 
01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:40.950 align:start position:0%
no one says we have to take uh funding
from

01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
the medicaid and medicare
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
so essentially it's not illegal
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
to uh have this this bill
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
it would simply cause us to forfeit all
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
of that funding
 
01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.790 align:start position:0%
of that funding
so

01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think potentially
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
but potentially yeah but
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
but the risk is there and i don't think
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
the courts are going to say the courts
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
might say um yes you're going to lose
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
the funding but i don't think it would
 
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.510 align:start position:0%
the funding but i don't think it would
say

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
the bill is uh unconstitutional or
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr you guys want to be clear
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
on what you're voting on so i know what
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
i have to do so it sounds like we're
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
vote if the vote would be to recommend
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
otpa but the amendment may be slightly
 
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
adjusted to deal with the language
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
regularly versus one-time language i
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
don't think we can
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
vote the amendment ought to pass i think
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
we can vote to recommend it to the full
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
labor committee is that correct yes
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i i believe the form has um a
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
emotion on it does it not it's been a
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
while since i looked at it
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
i have never done one of these so
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
you can be as formal or informal as you
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
want you can make a recommendation
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
each of the members of the subcommittee
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
are going to have their right to discuss
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
their opinions of what went on in the
 
01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.109 align:start position:0%
their opinions of what went on in the
subcommittee

01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
when they testify so
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
this is not as formal as our other votes
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to get more
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
detail flush out possible amendments and
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
possible problems to bring a better
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
answer to the
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
other representatives that were not here
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
better answer and possibly a better
 
01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.950 align:start position:0%
better answer and possibly a better
product

01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
it would just be helpful if we know
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're voting on okay so we
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
i will make the motion that we uh
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
support the amendment when we meet as a
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the labor committee uh with some
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
possible changes clarifications to the
 
01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.709 align:start position:0%
possible changes clarifications to the
amendment

01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.719 --> 01:37:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
just a question as to why the
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry can you say that he ended up
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
being an answer the severability is
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
so again i think the severability is in
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
two different locations
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken let me just confirm
 
01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:15.430 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken let me just confirm
that

01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's in online 24 on page one if
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
any provision of this section which
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
deals with the labor laws and then if
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
you scroll down under the
 
01:38:23.119 --> 01:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
you scroll down under the
um

01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education there's also a
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
several bit of clause so there's two
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
different several
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
should they yes the follow-up yeah
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
should there be one under the medical
 
01:38:37.679 --> 01:38:38.629 align:start position:0%
should there be one under the medical
side

01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
or dhhs side
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
for severability if something like this
 
01:38:42.239 --> 01:38:43.430 align:start position:0%
for severability if something like this
happens

01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
the severability would have to stick
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
with the chapter of law that you're
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
referencing it to so in this case we're
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
referencing uh 275 78 and that's the
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
chapter of that's the
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about severability of
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
that chapter of law or that specific rsa
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
so if any provision of that rsa is
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
deemed unconstitutional
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
only that provision is struck from the
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
law not the entire law thank you
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
so the motion made is there a second on
 
01:39:11.119 --> 01:39:13.830 align:start position:0%
so the motion made is there a second on
that

01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
and colorworld
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.870 align:start position:0%

it is
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
three to two the motion passes
 
01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:51.510 align:start position:0%
three to two the motion passes
okay

01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%

02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
due to productivity quotas um and i
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
think this provides a lot of
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
transparency to new potential employees
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh as to what productivity quotas they
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
would be subject to
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh with that being said um i move otpa

workplace and expedient to legislate i
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
ask that my motivation is seconded and i
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
asked to be able to speak to my motion
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative warden you're
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
recognized to
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
speak on your motion
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
while i applaud the author's attempt to
 
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
grant people the freedom to be
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and or use ppe in the
 
02:12:08.639 --> 02:12:10.310 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and or use ppe in the
workplace

02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
such freedom already exists and it is
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
not the government's purpose to grant or
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
would seek to disallow discrimination of
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
which we see no evidence of here in new
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire furthermore it does not
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
address discrimination in accordance
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
with like protected classes finally
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is an at-will state
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
as far as working
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
and this bill is just not necessary
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
folks can get a vaccination and they see
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
as they desire so
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
i ask that you itl this thank you
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to um oppose the itl motion
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the basis that
 
02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
on the basis that
they're

02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
very well could be some employers out
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
there who would um
 
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.109 align:start position:0%
there who would um
uh

02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
ask their employees not to wear
 
02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:11.430 align:start position:0%
ask their employees not to wear
pppe

02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
pppe
 
02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.629 align:start position:0%
pppe
um

02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think someone should have a right to
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
put on a mask if they're trying to
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
protect their health
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
so um i
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
sullivan representative seaworth
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i am going to
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
stated while he was advocating for his
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
bill that it was
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
possibly unnecessary or at least
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
probably harmless
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a couple of sentences
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's very broad it applies to everybody
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know what what are we missing
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
in not giving this a lot of thought i i
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
certainly agree uh with the previous
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
speaker that
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
um an employer probably is wrong to
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
to take an employee who wants to wear
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of protective
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
face mask or whatever and say you know i
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
don't like that you can't wear it but
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
what if it's a safety issue what if the
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
kind of paper fibrous masks
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
are a risk because of the temperature of
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
the machines that that you're operating
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
in have we
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
in this language made the kind of
 
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.669 align:start position:0%
in this language made the kind of
exceptions

02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
that we usually do
 
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
when we consider a bill of that's this
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
sort so i would support the itl if for
 
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
no other reason then i don't think this
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
language is yet fully formed and if we
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
were to go down this road i think we'd
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
spend some more time doing it right
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:11.589 --> 02:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
the chairman will um
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
the the the bill is written um has
 
02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.830 align:start position:0%
the the the bill is written um has
inconsistencies

02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
i don't see it
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
passing any muster of law or have
 
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:29.430 align:start position:0%

very convoluted if you all recall

if you were on your way to
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
the drugstore to get a vaccine because
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
your local bakery wanted you to have a
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine before they would let you into
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
their bakery and you got into a car
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
accident in a way
 
02:23:08.479 --> 02:23:09.349 align:start position:0%

get your vaccine
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
you could
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
have a cause of action
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
against a bakery
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
because you had to go get a vaccine
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
as well as against the bakery uh if you
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
somehow became ill because of the
 
02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:26.630 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
from this committee as to how this would
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
be beneficial
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
given the fact that there was
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
nothing that the labor department could
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
bring to us that it was a problem so um
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.190 --> 02:28:59.200 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:19.110 align:start position:0%
um
as

02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative avalani stated during the
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
testimony the sponsor
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
said that he wasn't aware of an employee
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
who had an issue with this in the course
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
of employment he just thought the lack
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
of this protection might
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
deter people who would consider
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
volunteering from volunteering so i
 
02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
agree that this is
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
possible problem but i'm i'm not sure
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're fixing a problem that's actually
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
and again it's kind of general language
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
meant to apply to everyone
 
02:30:54.399 --> 02:30:55.429 align:start position:0%
meant to apply to everyone
um

02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:57.910 --> 02:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
and and we're not considering
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
the exceptions that would need to be in
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
such a law for example if i look to my
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
right here
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
what would happen if one day
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
my friend
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
called in
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
10 minutes before his flight was
 
02:31:13.270 --> 02:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to take off and said you know
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
what could you hold my flight i'm going
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
to be an hour late because i was on a
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
fire call
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just not going to be able to get in
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
on time
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
some jobs that works and i think there's
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of employers out there that really
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
support the need
 
02:31:31.359 --> 02:31:32.230 align:start position:0%
support the need
um

02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
for volunteers
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
in in these services but there are other
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
jobs that it just can't work it's
 
02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:40.389 align:start position:0%
jobs that it just can't work it's
incompatible

02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
incompatible
 
02:31:40.399 --> 02:31:41.190 align:start position:0%
incompatible
uh

02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
with the business model and i think that
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
we as legislators need to leave it up to
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
the employers to figure that out and
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
make the decisions of how they will
 
02:31:53.439 --> 02:31:54.550 align:start position:0%
make the decisions of how they will
support

02:31:54.550 --> 02:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
their their employees who also volunteer
 
02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
president of cahill
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
i understand the example that my friend
 
02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
from pembroke has given and i i don't
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
know that uh
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
i i think we can rely on the just on the
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
judgment of people who volunteer for
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
these roles that they would know that
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
the job that they have or may take
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent and i would expect that
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know a person
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh would
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
would take that into account when
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
applying for a job and understand that
 
02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
being a volunteer fireman is an
 
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
important role in the community
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
if they need to have a different job
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
then i that can't accommodate the
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
schedule such as an airline pilot or
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
many others i suppose it would be to
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
their judgment so i would
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of the amendment if we get
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
as representative
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
seaworth mentioned uh i think this bill
 
02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
seaworth mentioned uh i think this bill
is

02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
trying to fix a non-existent problem the
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
question i did ask representative
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
des was how many times was he aware of
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
this actually being a factor and the
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
answer was zero
 
02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:16.150 align:start position:0%
answer was zero
um

02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
also as representative c was
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
points out that
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
you can't apply
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
a broad
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%

or employee out there

i believe we have a system that works
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
fine i don't believe we need to be
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
putting our
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%

to join the force a lot of
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
employees who serve on volunteer
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
departments could
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
if they're called some period of time
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
prior to their shift
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
and if it is reasonable under the
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances could decide they can't
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
afford to go to the call because of the
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
fact that they would have to report
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
subsequently to work so it's for that
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
reason also that i support the amendment
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
in 1970
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
my family moved into the little sleepy
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
town of amherst new hampshire
 
02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
where there were more hunters and cows
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
than there were people
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
we had a volunteer fire department
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
and later on we got our own ambulance
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
and our own volunteer rescue squad
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
and it was the pride of the town
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the individuals that would become
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:55.510 --> 02:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
it was one gentleman who was the chief
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
who was uh
 
02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:58.630 align:start position:0%
who was uh
would

02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
deliver your laundry to you your dry
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
employers

02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:07.349 align:start position:0%
employers
wanted

02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
02:36:07.359 --> 02:36:09.670 align:start position:0%
wanted
volunteers

02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be firefighters
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
and emts they wanted it because if it
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
ever happened to them
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
if they had a heart attack they wanted
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure someone was coming if there
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
was a fire they wanted to make sure
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
someone was coming
 
02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:24.230 align:start position:0%
someone was coming
and

02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
it was never a time that i can recall
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
any problem with employers
 
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
not wanting to give people time off to
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
be able to offer that service
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with the concept of the
 
02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:39.750 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with the concept of the
bill

02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
but our job here in my opinion is not to
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily just agree to a concept but
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
look at what the need is we have had
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
many bills come in front of us regarding
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
talking about why it's a good idea
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
and then we get letters and we get phone
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
calls and we get emails
 
02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
as to why they want that bill passed
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
it should be noted
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
that one individual came and supported
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill that was a sponsor
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
not one
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer fire chief
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
has contacted me
 
02:37:26.309 --> 02:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
or written me an email or written to the
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
so how important is it how much of an
 
02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
i do not believe we should be
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
passing legislation
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
where no one has come to us other than
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
one individual
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
saying that they should have this
 
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
i just don't think we should do it i say
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
i'm all in favor of the volunteer fire
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
department again i just told you this
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
lengthy story about my little upbringing
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
in amherst
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
okay it was important
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm glad we had it i have fond memories
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:08.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a problem
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
and there's not
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
i i also haven't heard that we don't
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
have enough volunteer firefighters or
 
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer emts in these towns because of
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.429 align:start position:0%
their jobs
um

02:38:21.429 --> 02:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:21.439 --> 02:38:24.469 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just i can't see supporting
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
something that we don't have a problem
 
02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
is anyone else willing
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
like to speak on this motion on this
 
02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
like to speak on this motion on this
bill

02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just a question for
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
anyone who can answer it i assume
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
the idea also comes from
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
how um national guard folks are treated
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
i know that i believe there's a law
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
protecting them
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
and their jobs or at least there have
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
been bills to say that
 
02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
been bills to say that
um

02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
was that part of the since i missed the
 
02:39:05.670 --> 02:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
hearing is that part of the
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind this if there
 
02:39:11.429 --> 02:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
weren't any specific incidents incident
 
02:39:11.439 --> 02:39:12.870 align:start position:0%
weren't any specific incidents incident
incidences

02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
incidences
 
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
is that what
 
02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
the impetus behind the bill is
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
the um i will answer the uh there was
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
nothing related to anything to do with
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
the national guard or such the
 
02:39:27.510 --> 02:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
belief was that sponsor put the bill
 
02:39:29.670 --> 02:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
forth that he had a feeling and a
 
02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
discussion with at least
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
a potential
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
individual who was considering being a
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter and felt that
 
02:39:39.439 --> 02:39:40.469 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter and felt that
um

02:39:40.469 --> 02:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
unless there was a bill that would
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
protect them for being late or not
 
02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:45.510 align:start position:0%
protect them for being late or not
missing

02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
missing
 
02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:47.349 align:start position:0%
missing
um

02:39:47.349 --> 02:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
that they needed this to be able to feel
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable with volunteering
 
02:39:55.270 --> 02:39:55.280 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think the sponsor had an interesting
 
02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
idea here and he tried to write an
 
02:44:53.359 --> 02:44:54.870 align:start position:0%
idea here and he tried to write an
amendment

02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
02:44:58.469 --> 02:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
tone it down and do something that we
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
could support the amendment didn't come
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
out of ols as i discussed with him
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh on him to
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
continue to let that idea percolate and
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
bring it back next year
 
02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
if it's something that
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
he can
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
crystallize and get us in a form we'd
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
want to move forward with but for right
 
02:45:17.359 --> 02:45:18.710 align:start position:0%

representative warden you're recognized
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear a lot of testimony on
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
this one and the bill frankly does have
 
02:50:03.429 --> 02:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
a couple good points to it
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
such as permitting an employee to opt
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
out of medical mandate but unfortunately
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
there were too many fatal flaws in this
 
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:09.670 align:start position:0%
there were too many fatal flaws in this
bill

02:50:09.670 --> 02:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
the term medical mandate is central to
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
it but it was not even defined well it's
 
02:50:16.230 --> 02:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
too vague and then this bill is the one
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
that would require
 
02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:19.190 align:start position:0%
that would require
employer

02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
to pay severance equal to two-thirds of
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
the value of the employee's total
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
compensation if you guys remember that
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
there were some questions about whether
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
bonuses or commission for those people
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
who are on full
 
02:50:33.750 --> 02:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
full commission
 
02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:35.429 align:start position:0%
full commission
and

02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
whether it would run alongside
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so with all those
 
02:50:39.359 --> 02:50:40.389 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so with all those
flaws

02:50:40.389 --> 02:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
flaws
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
i think in excluding to legislate is
 
02:50:44.230 --> 02:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this and if there's a
 
02:50:45.429 --> 02:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
problem in the future they can come back
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%

occur with the e-verify system
 
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
and could
 
02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
force somebody out of work for uh
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and we've got an i9 system
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
that's effective it works and
 
02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
it assures that
 
02:52:58.230 --> 02:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
are not qualified to come to work are
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
not allowed to work
 
02:53:04.389 --> 02:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
so um i think this is a bill that's
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and
 
02:53:11.110 --> 02:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.269 --> 02:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
i will rise in opposition to the itl
 
02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
motion um
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
i i have to admit i'm a little bit
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
conflicted on this because there are
 
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
some um
 
02:53:24.309 --> 02:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
pluses and minuses that go along with it
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
one of my
 
02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
very big concerns right now is the
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration issue
 
02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
and this i believe would
 
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
have some effect on
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
slowing that down i do see the the
 
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
downsides um as representative sullivan
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
spoke to uh spoke to we don't like
 
02:53:44.399 --> 02:53:45.590 align:start position:0%
spoke to uh spoke to we don't like
putting

02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
putting
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
mandates on businesses
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
once in a while
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
we have to go against the 100 percent
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
nothing could be 100 percent and for me
 
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
this is one of those
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i will vote against the itil motion
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative schultz thank you mr
 
02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
chair i have a question for you and by
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
the way for the record i really want to
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
be on this committee in the future so
 
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
next time if i'm re-elected i'm going to
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
put it down because we're the cool kids
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
so see this is my warm-up you know not
 
02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
just the bills i've brought to you
 
02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:25.349 align:start position:0%
just the bills i've brought to you
um

02:54:25.349 --> 02:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how many people signed in
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
in favor or against the bill
 
02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm also curious to know among those
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
who testified
 
02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
did anyone from the bia or any of our
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
business leaders address this because
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i will just make a point
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
it is definitely my impression given how
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
awful our current immigration visa
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
status is
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
our businesses do not have enough
 
02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:54.630 align:start position:0%
our businesses do not have enough
employees

02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
to match the number of visas that we get
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:55:03.110 --> 02:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
and it is a huge problem and as i
 
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
understand it and maybe i should let you
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
answer the question but
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
as i understand it from my conversations
 
02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
with business leaders
 
02:55:12.479 --> 02:55:13.510 align:start position:0%
with business leaders
uh

02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
especially in our tourism industry in
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
the summer and in our tech sector
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
especially in the southern part of the
 
02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
state this is enormously difficult
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
and anything that would be in the
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
category of quote
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
addressing undocumented immigrants in a
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
negative way actually also hurts the
 
02:55:32.479 --> 02:55:33.830 align:start position:0%
negative way actually also hurts the
existing

02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
workers that they do rely upon and we
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
actually do too by way of eating the
 
02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
food or being in a room that was clean
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
or using the software
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
i should have let you
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
answer my questions first
 
02:55:48.790 --> 02:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
no worries you're allowed to make your
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
comments as everyone else have an answer
 
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
to your question on house bill 1124 who
 
02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
signed up online 93 opposed for support
 
02:55:58.870 --> 02:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
one neutral and there were six
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh my recommended notes here six
 
02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
individuals spoke against it i believe
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's only one who spoke in favor of
 
02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:07.030 align:start position:0%
there's only one who spoke in favor of
it

02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:09.030 --> 02:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you mr
 
02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:09.990 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you mr
chairman

02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
i i want to uh respond and nothing
 
02:56:16.309 --> 02:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
against your comment i i think
 
02:56:16.319 --> 02:56:17.190 align:start position:0%
against your comment i i think
um

02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:19.830 --> 02:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
what you said i heard from some of the
 
02:56:22.230 --> 02:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
public testimony that we had
 
02:56:24.469 --> 02:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that some of those who
 
02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
testified against this bill did a
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
disservice to their cause
 
02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:30.469 align:start position:0%
disservice to their cause
as

02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
as representative sullivan said when he
 
02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
made the motion
 
02:56:36.630 --> 02:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
we do have a system
 
02:56:40.630 --> 02:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
that prohibits employers from hiring
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
employees who are ineligible to work by
 
02:56:46.469 --> 02:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
whether an employer uses e-verify or
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
whether they use the i-9 system that
 
02:56:55.349 --> 02:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
does not change who is eligible and who
 
02:56:57.269 --> 02:56:57.279 align:start position:0%
is ineligible to work
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i was a little concerned that some
 
02:57:01.429 --> 02:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
people who spoke uh during the testimony
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
gave the impression that we shouldn't
 
02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
pass this bill because they wanted more
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
people who were ineligible to work to
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
actually be eligible
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i just think that
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
whether they
 
02:57:20.230 --> 02:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
they believe that as a matter of policy
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
or not i don't think that's relevant to
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
this bill and i think it does a
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
disservice to our debate on this bill to
 
02:57:27.359 --> 02:57:28.389 align:start position:0%
disservice to our debate on this bill to
imply

02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
imply
 
02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that's a factor as to whether you
 
02:57:32.230 --> 02:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
should support or oppose this
 
02:57:32.240 --> 02:57:33.910 align:start position:0%
should support or oppose this
legislation

02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:35.190 align:start position:0%
legislation
thank

02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:38.389 align:start position:0%
thank
thank you

02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:40.309 --> 02:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
i personally support
 
02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'll go ahead representative smith i
 
02:57:44.150 --> 02:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
didn't see your hand
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think what we
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually heard was in the testimony that
 
02:57:51.190 --> 02:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
there are people who are new to our
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
country who are perfectly legal and
 
02:57:55.830 --> 02:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
ready to to work here
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a lot of
 
02:57:59.269 --> 02:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
folks coming in from other countries
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
looking for what new hampshire offers
 
02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:03.030 align:start position:0%
looking for what new hampshire offers
and

02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:58:06.070 --> 02:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
they aren't in systems yet they need to
 
02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
start working immediately and running
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
them through a second database not just
 
02:58:13.030 --> 02:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
the i9 but the federal database that
 
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
keeps track of all of this it takes time
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
and it's something that a lot of
 
02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
families do not have
 
02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
my biggest issue with this is it's
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
another mandate on businesses small
 
02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
businesses do not have personnel um
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
folks to do all of this work for them
 
02:58:31.830 --> 02:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
this this is intrusive in small business
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i really think that this is
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because i-9 operates very
 
02:58:38.150 --> 02:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
02:58:41.190 --> 02:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:58:47.269 --> 02:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
one of my big concerns with this is
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
i believe we had discussions around
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
how practical it is to repeal this
 
02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
leader if we find it's not working
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
once a business is required to sign up
 
02:58:58.790 --> 02:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the federal e-verify program by the
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's unclear that they can actually
 
02:59:03.510 --> 02:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish that
 
02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:04.309 align:start position:0%
accomplish that
and

02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
withdraw from the system
 
02:59:07.990 --> 02:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
and so the prospect that will be
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
entering into something that we don't
 
02:59:09.359 --> 02:59:11.030 align:start position:0%
entering into something that we don't
have

02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
a way to tweak or modify or change the
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
scope of later
 
02:59:17.670 --> 02:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
is of great concern to me and that's why
 
02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:24.550 --> 02:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
i support e-verify but i will be
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the testimony the thing that bothered
 
02:59:32.469 --> 02:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
me probably the most
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
was the comment was made about how
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
some individuals who are not legal to
 
02:59:39.510 --> 02:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess you know you have to be
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
careful use the right term people that
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
are not able to um
 
02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
what was it what was the term i don't
 
02:59:49.830 --> 02:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
undocumented thank you
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
undocumented workers
 
02:59:55.590 --> 02:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
are treated poorly
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
that aren't paid well
 
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
they're in unsafe situations
 
03:00:02.630 --> 03:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
so it behooves the fact that why would
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
we want them to work
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
here if they are undocumented and
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
subject to poor wages and unsafe
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
working conditions so we verify would be
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
a good thing
 
03:00:15.279 --> 03:00:16.469 align:start position:0%
a good thing
however

03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:00:18.870 --> 03:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
while we were sitting here
 
03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
mr berkey
 
03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
was just able on his cell phone to get
 
03:00:25.830 --> 03:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
flowers for his wife
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
make dinner reservations check out
 
03:00:29.910 --> 03:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
flights and what they were going to cost
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
so he could take her someplace nice
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
but we can't do that with the effervite
 
03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:35.830 align:start position:0%
but we can't do that with the effervite
system

03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't know a two-letter last name
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't understand
 
03:00:42.550 --> 03:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
maybe some
 
03:00:44.230 --> 03:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
situations where someone
 
03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
their culture has three names
 
03:00:49.110 --> 03:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
and that's ridiculous
 
03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:51.190 align:start position:0%
and that's ridiculous
because

03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
amazon can get something here tomorrow
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
or anywhere in the country and it seems
 
03:00:57.910 --> 03:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh but we can't seem to figure this out
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
so while i do support the system i sure
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
hope someday it gets fixed
 
03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:03.670 align:start position:0%
hope someday it gets fixed
um

03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
and it was disturbing to hear that in
 
03:01:09.429 --> 03:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
a minimal 20 some percent 30 of the
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
people are utilizing it
 
03:01:15.750 --> 03:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i do support some kind of a system
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
but just just not quite this bill the
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
way it's been
 
03:01:20.950 --> 03:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
presented so
 
03:01:26.309 --> 03:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:31.349 --> 03:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
come on your wife is watching she's
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
expecting flowers she's she's expecting
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:41.429 --> 03:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional comments mr clark

uh
 
03:02:51.590 --> 03:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
who would like either just a uh a 15
 
03:02:54.309 --> 03:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
minute break or 30 minutes uh who would
 
03:02:57.190 --> 03:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
like 15 minutes and to go on
 
03:02:58.870 --> 03:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
it would like 30 minutes and then we go
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
on okay we're gonna take 30 minutes
 
03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
we'll be back here at five minutes after
 
03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:02.469 align:start position:0%

one

03:03:02.469 --> 03:03:02.479 align:start position:0%

i'll i'll give you a few i just figured
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
maybe by this time the uh the cafeteria
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be overly crowded so you
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
can grab something
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%

first bill is
 
03:39:32.070 --> 03:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%

i move an expedient to legislate on hp
1053

03:39:43.189 --> 03:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
1053
 
03:39:43.199 --> 03:39:44.389 align:start position:0%
1053
second

03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
motion is inexpedient to legislate by
 
03:39:46.239 --> 03:39:47.269 align:start position:0%
motion is inexpedient to legislate by
warden

03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
warden
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
seconded by abalone
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative warden you recognized if
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
you all may recall this
 
03:39:55.990 --> 03:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill would have required an employer to
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
pay wages and an hourly rate equal to
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
time and a half to any employee
 
03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
if the employer called them into
 
03:40:04.870 --> 03:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
work hours not previously scheduled
 
03:40:07.189 --> 03:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the employer's normal
 
03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh scheduling procedure
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
so it was a little bit unclear
 
03:40:13.349 --> 03:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
what the normal scheduling procedure was
 
03:40:14.550 --> 03:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
and of course this is going to yet
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
another mandate on
 
03:40:18.710 --> 03:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
employers who have all sorts of
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
different arrangements depending on the
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
industries they're in and the timing and
 
03:40:22.319 --> 03:40:23.110 align:start position:0%
industries they're in and the timing and
the

03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:23.120 --> 03:40:24.070 align:start position:0%
the
shifts

03:40:24.070 --> 03:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
shifts
 
03:40:26.070 --> 03:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
and the size of the company we did hear
 
03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
from a number of associations
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
representing employers and businesses
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
who were opposed
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i have to agree with them and their
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you would anyone else like to
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
while i kind of like the idea of the
 
03:40:55.199 --> 03:40:56.070 align:start position:0%
while i kind of like the idea of the
bill

03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
um i think we heard enough
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
testimony over how
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
difficult it would be to implement
 
03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:05.030 align:start position:0%
difficult it would be to implement
that

03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:06.469 --> 03:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's a way to do this but
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to be it so i would
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%

me a second here it was uh moved by
warden

03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes one of the issues i had with it is
 
03:41:32.950 --> 03:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
well it seemed to have a good concept
 
03:41:36.150 --> 03:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
paying time and a half for someone who
 
03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:37.830 align:start position:0%
paying time and a half for someone who
um

03:41:37.830 --> 03:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.150 --> 03:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary time
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know you
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
if you're not scheduled to come in you
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
can't come in you're not going to come
 
03:42:00.550 --> 03:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
in you're away you have plans you're
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
doing whatever
 
03:42:04.389 --> 03:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
and trying to entice someone with a time
 
03:42:05.670 --> 03:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
um to possibly give up their plans
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
again we always talk about
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
trying to be
 
03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
fair with the workers i just i just
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
thought it was a dichotomy
 
03:42:15.199 --> 03:42:16.309 align:start position:0%
thought it was a dichotomy
anyway

03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:42:16.319 --> 03:42:18.309 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
03:42:21.910 --> 03:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
with emotion on the floor is
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
it expedient to legislate it's been
 
03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
sorry for the confusion as i mentioned
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
earlier uh this morning this is one of
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
two bills that dealt with a
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
i think the same problem
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
this intersection between
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:53.429 --> 03:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
and non-compete agreements
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
for those of us who were present for the
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing i think we
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
had during that discussion there were
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
some concerns about the original
 
03:45:02.399 --> 03:45:03.670 align:start position:0%
some concerns about the original
language

03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
and uh mr chairman i would like my
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
motion to be to offer an amendment
 
03:45:14.070 --> 03:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
right um your motion is
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
moving amendment number
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
amendment number zero three seven six
 
03:45:24.790 --> 03:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
i kind of miss that
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
all this confusion and uh for members of
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
the committee i don't know if i
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned this to all of you i sent an
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
email out with a copy of this amendment
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
earlier this week if you got it
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
electronically there are also some
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
copies on the table
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
this was it's the audience that you
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
could get it was also handed out to each
 
03:45:48.150 --> 03:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
individual member
 
03:45:55.830 --> 03:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
and i will speak to this amendment
 
03:46:00.389 --> 03:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
when you're ready just want to get to
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone has a copy of the
 
03:46:06.150 --> 03:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.590 --> 03:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
president of fellows and schultz you
 
03:46:07.600 --> 03:46:12.389 align:start position:0%
president of fellows and schultz you
have

03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
all right representative seaworth you
 
03:46:13.680 --> 03:46:14.710 align:start position:0%
all right representative seaworth you
recognize

03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
so as i said in the in the original
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
testimony i think there were a number of
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions some concerns about the
 
03:46:23.590 --> 03:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
original language and
 
03:46:25.189 --> 03:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
we offered that we'd work with the
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor to come up with some better
 
03:46:26.960 --> 03:46:27.990 align:start position:0%
sponsor to come up with some better
language

03:46:27.990 --> 03:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
i actually did
 
03:46:32.229 --> 03:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
work with him directly as he was
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
drafting the amendment that we now have
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
before us and
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
i i do think this makes the bill better
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
i i think this makes it a a bill that we
 
03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
can get bipartisan agreement
 
03:46:49.349 --> 03:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
that it will be a positive thing
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire workers
 
03:46:55.030 --> 03:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
briefly briefly i'd like to go a little
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
bit into the context of this because i
 
03:47:00.150 --> 03:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
think it is important the chairman has
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
explained to us on
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
in an earlier meeting
 
03:47:04.800 --> 03:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
in an earlier meeting
that

03:47:05.910 --> 03:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
this is an area the area of non-compete
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
agreements that a few years ago
 
03:47:10.880 --> 03:47:11.590 align:start position:0%
agreements that a few years ago
the

03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:13.990 --> 03:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state supreme court came
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
down with a ruling that essentially said
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
that a non-compete agreement cannot take
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
away an individual's right to earn a
 
03:47:23.439 --> 03:47:24.389 align:start position:0%
away an individual's right to earn a
living

03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
living
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
and so that sort of hemmed in
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
the possible scope of non-compete
 
03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
agreements from what maybe someone like
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
me remembers from the 90s where a lot of
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
companies would just throw these things
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
at you and they'd be very limiting and
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
frankly a lot of people said well
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
most of that's unenforceable anyway
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
the supreme court ruling uh delineated
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
some limitations to that and then
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that we passed a couple of
 
03:47:56.550 --> 03:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
laws that further limited it
 
03:47:56.560 --> 03:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
laws that further limited it
um

03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:57.520 --> 03:47:59.429 align:start position:0%
um
in

03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
2014 we passed a law that required
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
disclosure so you cannot enforce an
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
agreement unless you've provided the
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
full language of that agreement to an
 
03:48:13.590 --> 03:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
employee before they agree
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
before you bring them on as an employee
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
then in a couple years later and it was
 
03:48:22.389 --> 03:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you were not in the house
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
but you came to us as a
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable citizen and helped us get
 
03:48:29.110 --> 03:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
the language right we passed another
 
03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:30.070 align:start position:0%
the language right we passed another
bill

03:48:30.070 --> 03:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:31.349 align:start position:0%
bill
that

03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:34.309 --> 03:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.309 --> 03:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
non-compete agreements were
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
unenforceable for low-wage employees and
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
we defined in that law what we meant by
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
low wage it was up to double the federal
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
poverty level
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
and in additionally we had a we passed
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
another more narrowly targeted law
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the medical industry to deal with
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
some very specific issues they were
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
having there
 
03:48:58.000 --> 03:48:59.269 align:start position:0%
having there
so

03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's the context in the state law
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
we've kind of
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
walled in when you can
 
03:49:08.229 --> 03:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
apply a non-compete agreement as the
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
chairman mentioned
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
in an earlier session it's it's kind of
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
at a good balance now
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
during the testimony it was explained to
 
03:49:16.880 --> 03:49:17.750 align:start position:0%
during the testimony it was explained to
us

03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:49:17.760 --> 03:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
us
that

03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
even the original bill language the
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor thought it was merely restating
 
03:49:27.269 --> 03:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
what case law already applied and in
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
this case he cited the the federal law
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
and with the federal law there's this
 
03:49:35.189 --> 03:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
term material change the terms of
 
03:49:35.199 --> 03:49:36.830 align:start position:0%
term material change the terms of
employment

03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
employment
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
that will result in nullifying a
 
03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
pre-existing non-compete agreement
 
03:49:44.160 --> 03:49:45.510 align:start position:0%
pre-existing non-compete agreement
and

03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear i am not an
 
03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
expert in this i'm i'm not a labor
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
lawyer i
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
please take everything i say
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
as someone who has tried to
 
03:49:59.349 --> 03:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
research this on their own
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
but if i understand this the example
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
that i found was so someone's hired and
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
for for a
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
nice salary and part of that is that
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
they sign a non-compete agreement and
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
and you may make the decision that yes
 
03:50:17.030 --> 03:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
for for this amount of money i'm willing
 
03:50:19.189 --> 03:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
to potentially
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
sign away my rights for a couple of
 
03:50:21.040 --> 03:50:21.990 align:start position:0%
sign away my rights for a couple of
years

03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:50:24.150 --> 03:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
then later as you're employed the
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
employer comes back and says you know
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
what we're cutting your salary in half
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
well that no longer looks like a good
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
deal and the courts have held that that
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
will nullify the agreement that you
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
signed under one set of conditions that
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
now no longer apply
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
in this amendment i tried to change the
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
focus of the bill
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
from this
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
covet vaccination
 
03:50:51.189 --> 03:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
to that particular issue
 
03:50:53.349 --> 03:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
and it starts out talking when there is
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
a material change of employment
 
03:50:57.750 --> 03:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
then that
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
requires that you either renegotiate any
 
03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:02.870 align:start position:0%
requires that you either renegotiate any
non-complete

03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
non-complete
 
03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:04.469 align:start position:0%
non-complete
non-compete

03:51:04.469 --> 03:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
non-compete
 
03:51:07.590 --> 03:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
contract that's already in place or the
 
03:51:10.389 --> 03:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
the previously signed non-compete
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
no longer applies
 
03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:14.309 align:start position:0%
no longer applies
um

03:51:14.309 --> 03:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:16.710 --> 03:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
i did
 
03:51:20.309 --> 03:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsor we did leave in
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the language about um
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
we expanded a little because one of the
 
03:51:27.910 --> 03:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions was you know what did it
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
exactly mean
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
so it now says um
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
i just lost it
 
03:51:37.590 --> 03:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
about medical intervention uh medical
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
testing and vaccination
 
03:51:41.910 --> 03:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
we left that in there that was the
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
intent of the original bill
 
03:51:47.189 --> 03:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
again the the sponsor said he thought
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is already
 
03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
the existing terrain based on case law i
 
03:51:54.389 --> 03:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that
 
03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think it changes anything
 
03:51:59.910 --> 03:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
to make that specific and
 
03:52:02.229 --> 03:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
and comport with the original intent of
 
03:52:03.510 --> 03:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:52:05.830 --> 03:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i would say in the broader sense
 
03:52:05.840 --> 03:52:07.990 align:start position:0%
and i would say in the broader sense
this

03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
this expectation that a material change
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
would nullify an existing non-compete
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
i think it is practically speaking
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
how things are we're not really changing
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
the way
 
03:52:25.750 --> 03:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
the legal environment surrounding
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
non-competes but what we are doing is in
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
some cases the the department of labor
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
will will now be able to get involved in
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
issues that formally would require a
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
civil suit and going to court and i
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
think that's consistent with the bills
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we've already passed in this area
 
03:52:45.840 --> 03:52:46.870 align:start position:0%
that we've already passed in this area
um

03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
the disclosure one comes to mind and i
 
03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
think it's consistent with
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh what we like
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
our department of labor to be able to do
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
in cases where employers and employees
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
have a dispute
 
03:53:00.319 --> 03:53:02.070 align:start position:0%
have a dispute
so

03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'll now hear if i'm right about that
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
but i hope that this amendment changes
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:53:10.550 --> 03:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
if you didn't support it before to be
 
03:53:11.830 --> 03:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
that hopefully everyone can agree with
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask a question on that if i
 
03:53:22.800 --> 03:53:24.150 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask a question on that if i
could

03:53:24.150 --> 03:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:53:25.990 --> 03:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
the new language delineates medical
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
testing vaccination and medical
 
03:53:29.920 --> 03:53:33.429 align:start position:0%
testing vaccination and medical
intervention

03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:33.439 --> 03:53:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
as

03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
shall be considered a material change is
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
it the intent of this language that
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.630 --> 03:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
items but it would actually apply to any
 
03:53:46.640 --> 03:53:47.910 align:start position:0%
items but it would actually apply to any
material

03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
material
 
03:53:47.920 --> 03:53:51.830 align:start position:0%
material
change

03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
and in fact the deputy commissioner
 
03:53:59.830 --> 03:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
asked me the exact same thing when i i
 
03:54:01.830 --> 03:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
asked him to review this and the way i
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
read this it is in addition
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
so it's any material change and then
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
just make sure to clarify that these
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:15.429 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
03:54:19.030 --> 03:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
or well and as i said i think they would
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
whether you stated or not
 
03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
i would expect those things to be
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
included but this clarifies that so
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a question
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
for uh representative seaworth if the
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
chair would allow
 
03:54:40.319 --> 03:54:41.189 align:start position:0%
chair would allow
yes

03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
um it's line 12 on the amendment at the
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
will of the employer could you just
 
03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
define what that means
 
03:54:50.790 --> 03:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.670 --> 03:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
the way i understand this and i did i
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
did speak with the sponsor before he
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
drafted the amendment i if it's
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:04.479 --> 03:55:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
one might wonder if i
 
03:55:14.710 --> 03:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
am asked to sign a new non-compete
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
because there's been a material change
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
in employment and i say you know what i
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't find these new terms
 
03:55:25.030 --> 03:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable i i won't sign
 
03:55:26.830 --> 03:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
can the employer say
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
because seaworth didn't sign he's
 
03:55:29.680 --> 03:55:31.030 align:start position:0%
because seaworth didn't sign he's
quitting

03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
quitting
 
03:55:31.040 --> 03:55:33.110 align:start position:0%
quitting
and

03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:33.120 --> 03:55:34.309 align:start position:0%
and
and

03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
whatever implications in terms of a
 
03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that might imply
 
03:55:42.150 --> 03:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the the intent of the language is
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
that the employer is required to come to
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
a new agreement
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh regarding a non-compete if in fact
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
that non-compete is a condition of
 
03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
employment it puts the onus on the
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
employer to come to terms
 
03:55:57.279 --> 03:55:58.229 align:start position:0%
employer to come to terms
and

03:55:58.229 --> 03:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:58.239 --> 03:55:59.830 align:start position:0%
and
it's

03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:56:03.030 --> 03:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
to my mind it's a bit of a bone we heard
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
about this
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
regarding another bill a different
 
03:56:06.880 --> 03:56:07.990 align:start position:0%
regarding another bill a different
subject

03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
subject
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
but in some cases these
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
labor disputes will end up on two
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
different tracks with the department of
 
03:56:15.760 --> 03:56:18.070 align:start position:0%
different tracks with the department of
labor

03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
labor
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that the department of labor
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
will be involved with this does not take
 
03:56:26.150 --> 03:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
away your right as an aggrieved employee
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
to file a civil suit and attempt to
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
recover whatever damages are appropriate
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
the department of labor on the other
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
hand is dealing with the employer so
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
that same employee might file the suit
 
03:56:41.590 --> 03:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
and then call up the department of labor
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
to report the problem in which case the
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
department would give a warning to that
 
03:56:47.670 --> 03:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
employer you know you're
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
forcing people to sign contracts that
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
you can't have them sign
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
they might work with them to try to get
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
that situation corrected
 
03:56:56.239 --> 03:56:57.349 align:start position:0%
that situation corrected
and

03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
if the employer still continues to be a
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
problem there might be fines levied
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
against them
 
03:57:05.990 --> 03:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
but in most cases the department of
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
labor isn't going in and
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
finding corrections
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
that will help the employee
 
03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:15.590 align:start position:0%
that will help the employee
and

03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
so part of the reason why i suggested
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
language to this effect is it does give
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
a little more to the employee who's
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
who's has a problem with this process
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
as they engage in whatever
 
03:57:33.269 --> 03:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
whatever they're going to do to try to
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
get things right with their employer it
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
gives them a little more
 
03:57:41.429 --> 03:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
the fact that they didn't sign this new
 
03:57:46.389 --> 03:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
agreement is not quitting it is a
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
given that it's after well
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
given that this at the will of the
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
employer would that qualify for
 
03:58:02.399 --> 03:58:06.229 align:start position:0%
employer would that qualify for
unemployment

03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
i i'm not going i'm not going to try to
 
03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
be definitive in this uh i would
 
03:58:19.110 --> 03:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually like to
 
03:58:22.150 --> 03:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
hear it from the experts from this i'll
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
give both sides of the story one is
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
that is what this implies here
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
the other side of it is this is not in
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
the employment securities law this is in
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
the wage and hours law
 
03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's specifically under
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
the non-compete section
 
03:58:40.479 --> 03:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
the non-compete section
so

03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:41.520 --> 03:58:42.630 align:start position:0%
so
would

03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
employment securities consider this law
 
03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
outside of theirs to be binding on them
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
that would be a question
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
um that i'd look to
 
03:59:04.710 --> 03:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:06.790 --> 03:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:12.790 --> 03:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
so it might correct an understanding
 
03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
an existing non-non-compete agreement
 
03:59:17.120 --> 03:59:18.389 align:start position:0%
an existing non-non-compete agreement
uh

03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
would require that did not include all
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
the possible things that could happen in
 
03:59:24.870 --> 03:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
the world such as a pandemic
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
if for example you you operated a uh a
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
medical practice and you're you hadn't
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
maybe your doctor has agreed to annoy
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
and compete for and they had to get
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
certain vaccinations and treatments but
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
they didn't list all of them and
 
03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
something new showed up with a new uh
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
with a new greek letter
 
03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
or name
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh you'd have to get a brand new
 
03:59:48.630 --> 03:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
non-compete at that point you couldn't
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
just have a broad
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
non-compete that says you'll get
 
03:59:56.469 --> 03:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
that was for you
 
03:59:58.640 --> 04:00:02.630 align:start position:0%
that was for you
yes

04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for for that question i
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
i do think it's a good question
 
04:00:08.800 --> 04:00:09.990 align:start position:0%
i do think it's a good question
and

04:00:09.990 --> 04:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
um it would depend on the individual
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
case so you have there's actually two
 
04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
things that apply here there's your
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
terms of employment
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the terms of the non-compete clause
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
and either of those could be as narrow
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
or broad as the employer
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
wants them to be
 
04:00:28.080 --> 04:00:28.870 align:start position:0%
wants them to be
so

04:00:28.870 --> 04:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:31.990 --> 04:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes in a hospital it might well say a
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
condition of employment is you get all
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccines as as recommended by the
 
04:00:37.920 --> 04:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
the vaccines as as recommended by the
cdc

04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
cdc
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
and and they
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
an employee knows that going in
 
04:00:44.960 --> 04:00:46.469 align:start position:0%
an employee knows that going in
as

04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:00:49.910 --> 04:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
that shrinks or grows based on uh what's
 
04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
going on in the world that hasn't
 
04:00:51.920 --> 04:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
going on in the world that hasn't
changed

04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:00:55.349 --> 04:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
to my mind again the the terms of
 
04:00:55.359 --> 04:00:57.030 align:start position:0%
to my mind again the the terms of
employment

04:00:57.030 --> 04:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
on the other hand it could be written
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
another way they could be very specific
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
about what the terms are
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
and a
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
a change to one of them would be
 
04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
considered that a material change
 
04:01:08.800 --> 04:01:11.590 align:start position:0%
considered that a material change
so

04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exactly answer your question
 
04:01:16.150 --> 04:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think it it it could work both ways
 
04:01:16.160 --> 04:01:17.429 align:start position:0%
i think it it it could work both ways
and

04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:20.070 --> 04:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
it would depend on the details
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the agreement with the employee and
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
the the non-compete agreement
 
04:01:27.429 --> 04:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up to sure
 
04:01:27.439 --> 04:01:28.309 align:start position:0%
follow-up to sure
uh

04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:01:30.630 --> 04:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable to to request a
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of amendment exempting medical
 
04:01:33.359 --> 04:01:40.070 align:start position:0%
some sort of amendment exempting medical
personnel

04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're off
 
04:01:45.830 --> 04:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
at this point you know there's no
 
04:01:48.309 --> 04:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
amendments um this is an amendment to
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
the bill this is the only bill in front
 
04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
of us this is the only amendment in
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
front of us today and we will be
 
04:01:54.790 --> 04:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
executing today so
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the future a possible amendment
 
04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
possibly if this passes in the senate
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate but
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to hold
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh executive session today and uh wait
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
for an amendment representative
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay if i
 
04:02:13.590 --> 04:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
so part of this i'm presenting the
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
amendment but i'm i'm
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about the sponsors of both of
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
these bills and i think but i don't know
 
04:02:26.950 --> 04:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
that at least one of the bills maybe
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
the situation for medical
 
04:02:34.560 --> 04:02:35.670 align:start position:0%
the situation for medical
workers

04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:02:35.680 --> 04:02:36.469 align:start position:0%
workers
that

04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
what was happening is
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
people were finding that they had these
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
new mandates imposed at a medical
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
facility that they disagreed with
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
and so fine i
 
04:02:51.990 --> 04:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'll leave and go work somewhere else oh
 
04:02:53.429 --> 04:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
but you can't
 
04:02:53.439 --> 04:02:54.550 align:start position:0%
but you can't
because

04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's this non compete agreement that
 
04:02:58.150 --> 04:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't let you leave and go somewhere
 
04:03:00.309 --> 04:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
else so i think
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
at least for some of the sponsors and
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i as i said i can't really speak for
 
04:03:04.880 --> 04:03:06.550 align:start position:0%
and i as i said i can't really speak for
them

04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
the issue of the medical worker is
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
central to what they're trying to
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
address and remember this isn't a
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
broader issue of can you fire someone or
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
or can you require
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
an employee to do certain things this is
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of the non-compete
 
04:03:28.150 --> 04:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
agreement and when can you tell someone
 
04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know what you can't go across the
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
street and get another job even though
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
we're basically forcing you out the door
 
04:03:37.990 --> 04:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville thank you
 
04:03:39.910 --> 04:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm going to vote
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
in favor of the amendment um because i
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
think that's the best practice when as
 
04:03:44.560 --> 04:03:45.429 align:start position:0%
think that's the best practice when as
here

04:03:45.429 --> 04:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
it is clearly an improvement over the
 
04:03:47.920 --> 04:03:49.349 align:start position:0%
it is clearly an improvement over the
original

04:03:49.349 --> 04:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
even though i will pose the bill as
 
04:03:51.760 --> 04:03:58.229 align:start position:0%
even though i will pose the bill as
amended

04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm just wondering if
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's a this the amendment uses the
 
04:04:07.760 --> 04:04:08.870 align:start position:0%
there's a this the amendment uses the
term

04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:04:12.309 --> 04:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
material change in terms of employment
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere in statute
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
because if it's not it would just apply
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
to what it says here i i tried searching
 
04:04:24.630 --> 04:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
i i couldn't find find it
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
but that isn't i'm not saying that it's
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
not there just because i couldn't find
 
04:04:28.319 --> 04:04:29.429 align:start position:0%
not there just because i couldn't find
it

04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think we may have an answer for you
 
04:04:31.920 --> 04:04:32.830 align:start position:0%
i think we may have an answer for you
i

04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
think material change is what they would
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
call a legal team a legal term of art
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
i think you would find that in
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
a term that attorneys use in writing
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
contractual language
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
it may not be in the rsas but
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
material change is is something
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
representative cahill yes uh just to mr
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
shortcut would that term of art be
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of vague and
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of legal terms of arts
 
04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
that are intentionally written that way
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
so i would say this that could be
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
exactly the
 
04:05:19.920 --> 04:05:22.469 align:start position:0%
exactly the
point

04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative seaworthy if i may too
 
04:05:24.720 --> 04:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
representative seaworthy if i may too
and

04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:26.080 --> 04:05:26.790 align:start position:0%
and
not

04:05:26.790 --> 04:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:05:28.469 --> 04:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte is exactly right
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
on the legal side
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think we also can find cases in
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
the department of labor
 
04:05:37.760 --> 04:05:38.550 align:start position:0%
the department of labor
where

04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
we're relying on them to look at the
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
individual situation and the details of
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
the case and intelligently decide well
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
in this case for this employer and this
 
04:05:50.640 --> 04:05:51.910 align:start position:0%
in this case for this employer and this
employee

04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
does that change meet what we think is a
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
material change to the terms of
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
employment and i i think
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
it would
 
04:06:01.040 --> 04:06:02.389 align:start position:0%
it would
make

04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
the bill worse to try to define that
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
at the rsa level
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
because we really want
 
04:06:14.790 --> 04:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
the department of labor
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
to be doing that analysis
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis and i i think
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
their process of adjudicating disputes
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
between employer employees shows that
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
they're well suited to make those kind
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
i'm going to outline a few different
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
things here and then
 
04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
ask you a question
 
04:06:49.269 --> 04:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
lines 8 and 9 clearly state if an
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
employer makes any material change to
 
04:06:52.870 --> 04:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
the terms of the employment for any
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
employee any existing non-compete
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
agreement shall be enforceable against
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
such employee
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay pretty clear then you get down to
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
this line 12. new requirements for
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
medical testing vaccination or other
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
medical interventions established by the
 
04:07:09.750 --> 04:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
employer as a condition of employment
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
well osha requires
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
people that
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
remove asbestos and lead paint to be
 
04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:19.750 align:start position:0%
remove asbestos and lead paint to be
tested

04:07:19.750 --> 04:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
tested
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
at the beginning it's called a base test
 
04:07:23.429 --> 04:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
and they test them every x amount of
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
period because they want to see if
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
they've ingested a certain level of
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
either asbestos or lead
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
and if they do then they say okay you
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
got to back off doing this because
 
04:07:33.110 --> 04:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're ingesting too much of this
 
04:07:33.120 --> 04:07:34.830 align:start position:0%
you're ingesting too much of this
somehow

04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
04:07:34.840 --> 04:07:36.389 align:start position:0%
somehow
um

04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:36.399 --> 04:07:38.710 align:start position:0%
um
i

04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
was required by my employer
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
to receive a vaccination when the
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislature asked me to go abroad
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
um because of the country we were going
 
04:07:51.600 --> 04:07:55.750 align:start position:0%
um because of the country we were going
to

04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't even think about
 
04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
covid because covert vaccination is not
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
a vaccination by definition so it's not
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
even covered here
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
then you go down to this last
 
04:08:10.950 --> 04:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
three lines
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
15 16 and 17.
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
so up here you say these non-competes
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
and material changes you're out of your
 
04:08:17.760 --> 04:08:18.950 align:start position:0%
and material changes you're out of your
non-compete

04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
non-compete
 
04:08:21.189 --> 04:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
but then you say any other employment
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
agreement including confidentiality mis
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure trade secrets intellectual
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
property whatever are full force in
 
04:08:26.960 --> 04:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
property whatever are full force in
effect

04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
most of these agreements are
 
04:08:31.040 --> 04:08:33.189 align:start position:0%
most of these agreements are
multi-paragraphed

04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
multi-paragraphed
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
one is a non-compete one is a
 
04:08:35.199 --> 04:08:37.429 align:start position:0%
one is a non-compete one is a
non-disclosure

04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure
 
04:08:37.439 --> 04:08:38.469 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure
okay

04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:38.479 --> 04:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
okay
so

04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
i need to make sure
 
04:08:42.239 --> 04:08:45.349 align:start position:0%
i need to make sure
that

04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
no matter what material
 
04:08:48.640 --> 04:08:50.630 align:start position:0%
no matter what material
change

04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
whether osha requires it or whether
 
04:08:55.110 --> 04:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
something else then when we finally get
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
down to the all this really important
 
04:08:57.120 --> 04:08:58.550 align:start position:0%
down to the all this really important
stuff

04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
trade secrets intellectual property
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
customer lists all that other stuff is
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that's quite cute
 
04:09:10.880 --> 04:09:12.309 align:start position:0%
and that's quite cute
um

04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:12.319 --> 04:09:13.510 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes that was
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
when when we discussed this in public
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that was a key
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
those that seem to be
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
leaning toward supporting the original
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
bill that was a key component of their
 
04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
support that this wasn't broadly just
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
nullifying any contracts that employer
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
had with employee
 
04:09:37.110 --> 04:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
but that
 
04:09:39.670 --> 04:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
all these things would be exempt so that
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
language has been left in i think it's
 
04:09:44.229 --> 04:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
the the original language as the bill
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
was submitted it was certainly my
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
reading of it that
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
it it retains the
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
the original force that all it's making
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
clear that all of this only implies to
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
the non-compete portion and does not
 
04:10:00.640 --> 04:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
the non-compete portion and does not
affect

04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
affect
 
04:10:05.110 --> 04:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
very well thank you
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or
 
04:10:09.359 --> 04:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or
comments

04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%

um any member of this committee it is
 
04:10:17.439 --> 04:10:18.710 align:start position:0%
um any member of this committee it is
appropriate

04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
to ask questions so
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
um that's all well and good so don't
 
04:10:23.199 --> 04:10:24.389 align:start position:0%

the amendment has been passed the uh

bill is open to further amendment
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth i'd like to make
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
the motion ought to pass as amended
 
04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
emotion on the floor's out to pass
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
amendment is seconded by
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
second second by representative avalani
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
is open for discussion or questions oh
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
you need to speak emotionally i'm sorry
 
04:12:09.030 --> 04:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and not to belabor the point i as i
 
04:12:11.110 --> 04:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
said i think this amendment
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
um vastly improves the bill
 
04:12:16.149 --> 04:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
i think it changes it from a political
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
hot potato to something that actually
 
04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
protects workers rights
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the past this committee has had some
 
04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
concern about non-compete agreements and
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
over-application of them
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
and this provides one more protection
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
to a worker who feels trapped by an
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative manneville
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i uh uh will
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
oppose the uh uh ought to pass on um
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
hb 1 108 9.
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
um some of the points have been
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
discussed already i wanted to wait till
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the bill before i
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
weighed in on them
 
04:13:01.269 --> 04:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
what a material change is certainly is a
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
concern to me as we all know when
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers are looking at
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
at legislation that might be unclear
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
they will look at legislative history
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
that will include
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth's reference to
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
the case
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
that defined or mentioned
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
material in this respect they'll refer
 
04:13:26.309 --> 04:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps to representative turcotte's
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
description of lawyerly
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:35.110 --> 04:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
refer to the
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
plain meaning of it all of which could
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
be in conflict with each other and will
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
create potential
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
additional hurdles in terms of
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
the ultimate resolution of what is a
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
contractual right
 
04:13:48.479 --> 04:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
contractual right
being

04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
one for a non-compete clause
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
where this bill talks about
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
there being established new requirements
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
a point to a to which i think the
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
chairman was referring
 
04:14:00.960 --> 04:14:02.070 align:start position:0%
chairman was referring
um

04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
regarding medical testing etc
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
while there might be questions about how
 
04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
that would apply at a minimum it would
 
04:14:12.389 --> 04:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
also serve in my view to discourage
 
04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh the creation of new requirements that
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
would respond properly to emerging
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances which would create another
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
problem for this bill
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
and finally i would uh note in my
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
opinion that the
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
place for dealing with
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
overreach or
 
04:14:33.040 --> 04:14:34.950 align:start position:0%
overreach or
other

04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
in improper applications of uh
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
non-compete clauses are in the courts
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
not in the labor department uh or by way
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
of statute uh this being a contractual
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
um arrangement between parties as they
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
entered into an agreement again there's
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:54.960 --> 04:14:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
income

04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:15:01.110 --> 04:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.120 --> 04:15:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's the concern that i think
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
both private parties and legislators
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
have with regard to how much protection
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
there can be for
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
such things as
 
04:15:17.349 --> 04:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
confidential information
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
customer lists and the like obviously
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
as the chairman's pointed out there are
 
04:15:22.880 --> 04:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
as the chairman's pointed out there are
other

04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:31.110 --> 04:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
they can cover
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
the distribution of
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
documents for example but people bring
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
with them
 
04:15:38.710 --> 04:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
pertinent information important
 
04:15:38.720 --> 04:15:39.830 align:start position:0%
pertinent information important
information

04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:15:39.840 --> 04:15:42.149 align:start position:0%
information
and

04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:42.159 --> 04:15:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
legislature shouldn't be in my view
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
intervening in that respect so i for
 
04:15:56.149 --> 04:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
for the record since you brought it up
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
black's law dictionary
 
04:16:02.479 --> 04:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
black's law dictionary
um

04:16:05.110 --> 04:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
defines material change as a
 
04:16:08.950 --> 04:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
representation relating to matter which
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
is so substantial and important as to
 
04:16:13.349 --> 04:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
influence the party to whom
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
made the change
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
if that helps or not
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
that's extremely definitive right yes
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville sorry but i
 
04:16:31.590 --> 04:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
uttered as we both know in the insurance
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
industry it is defined to mean anything
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
that would change the rate or the
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
decision of the underwriter to accept or
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
reject a risk that's a fairly more
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
narrow definition
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
i'm just contemplating whether i'm going
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
to say something okay it takes time
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm very reluctant
 
04:17:03.600 --> 04:17:06.870 align:start position:0%
i'm very reluctant
um

04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
to mess with don competes that's why
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
people are going to non-piracy
 
04:17:10.640 --> 04:17:12.229 align:start position:0%
people are going to non-piracy
agreements

04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
i don't care if you want to compete if
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
you take something you got to pay for it
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
that being said the motion on the floor
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%

04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
in the state or two more locations i had
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
a question on that is okay if you have
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
two or more locations and you only have
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
two employees at each of those locations
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
and they still require even though the
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
total is less than 10. there's just a
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
lot of things in here that just makes
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
this bill unworkable and i recommend itl
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
on them
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
any additional comments
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
on the last bill i talked about an
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
incentive you know time and a half in in
 
04:20:51.120 --> 04:20:51.910 align:start position:0%
incentive you know time and a half in in
in

04:20:51.910 --> 04:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
lines 14 through 16 they talk about
 
04:20:55.590 --> 04:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
compensating someone
 
04:20:55.600 --> 04:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
compensating someone
um

04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
one and a half times their rate if it's
 
04:21:02.070 --> 04:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
if they're made to work in the rest
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
period well
 
04:21:04.870 --> 04:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
if you're tired
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
a regular time you're gonna be tired at
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
time and a half and it doesn't seem to
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:16.560 --> 04:21:19.429 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and and for
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
bringing that up you would also violate
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
section one on page two and you would
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
have a fifty dollar fine if you made
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
somebody work in your on their day of
 
04:21:29.359 --> 04:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
somebody work in your on their day of
rest

04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
rest
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
so i have to pay them pay i pay a fine
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.309 --> 04:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
all right anything else
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.600 --> 04:21:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
i think this uh bill came from a
 
04:21:53.830 --> 04:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
well-intended sp
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
place but uh
 
04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
04:21:59.110 --> 04:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
too unworkable too many problems i
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
really don't like it when somebody puts
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
two different completely different
 
04:22:04.950 --> 04:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
issues in one bill because you might
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
like one but not the other and um there
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
should have been two bills but besides
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to oppose
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%

calendar so even though we have another
 
04:23:54.790 --> 04:23:54.800 align:start position:0%

04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to go as far say dozens of
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
these similar bills but many many many
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
times we've seen this bill come
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
or variations of this bill come before
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
i always like to point out two instances
 
04:24:52.159 --> 04:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
i always like to point out two instances
where

04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:24:54.630 --> 04:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
politicians and bureaucrats have gotten
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
in between um the
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee relationship
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
and this is uh the example i always give
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of them is i guess would be about
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
four years now maine politicians decided
 
04:25:09.030 --> 04:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
they knew what was best for the
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
employees who made tips and uh in the
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
service industry and decided they would
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh do a similar bill and institute a
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for those individuals those
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
individuals soon found out that they
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
were actually making less per hour than
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
they were when they were being tipped
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
they formed an association and they got
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
the main legislature to overturn what
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
they had just passed the previous year
 
04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
back to the the other way my second
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
example is the last one one my last term
 
04:25:39.040 --> 04:25:40.149 align:start position:0%
example is the last one one my last term
here

04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we had a
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
similar uh bill i won't say exactly but
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
similar we had an individual testify an
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
owner of a pub in dover called the
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
seventh settlement
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
and he came here in an attempt he wanted
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be one of the first to implement a
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
straight across the board fifteen dollar
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for all his employees
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
whether you're a dishwasher you were a
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
server you're a bartender didn't matter
 
04:26:06.790 --> 04:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
everybody got 15 an hour
 
04:26:09.910 --> 04:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
we used to my wife and i used to
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
frequent that pub it was excellent
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
as soon as they implemented this guess
 
04:26:16.229 --> 04:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
what happened to service it went
 
04:26:16.239 --> 04:26:17.910 align:start position:0%
what happened to service it went
downhill

04:26:17.910 --> 04:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
downhill
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
less than a year later they shut down
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
the restaurant and a short time after
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
that they had to close the entire
 
04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
establishment we've got a very good
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
system we've heard
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
from individuals in the service industry
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
already that
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
the average uh tip minimum wage is
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere up around 20 an hour i know
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
for a fact because i have two individ uh
 
04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
son and daughter who both worked in that
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
industry that that number can far exceed
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
20 an hour
 
04:26:49.110 --> 04:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and can be almost amazing how much
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
individuals can make
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
as servers or bartenders so
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
for all those reasons uh we've got a
 
04:26:56.550 --> 04:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
system that works now we don't need to
 
04:27:00.630 --> 04:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
be changing it and i recommend itl
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.269 --> 04:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
i am going to oppose the itl
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
the uh and i want to also uh correct one
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
um misconception this bill does not ban
 
04:27:17.040 --> 04:27:18.229 align:start position:0%
um misconception this bill does not ban
tips

04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
tips
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
um this bill um provides for tipped
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
workers to earn at a minimum the true
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
minimum wage um they would then earn
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
tips on top of that
 
04:27:28.800 --> 04:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
tips on top of that
um

04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:30.399 --> 04:27:31.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:32.000 --> 04:27:33.670 align:start position:0%
and
i

04:27:33.670 --> 04:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of restaurants
 
04:27:35.680 --> 04:27:36.710 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of restaurants
um

04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:39.429 --> 04:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
are struggling to maintain their their
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh their workforce um some of the
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
restaurants i like to frequent are
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
closed on some nights of the week
 
04:27:47.429 --> 04:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
because they don't have enough staff
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
um so um i think um
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh this would assist with that problem
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
you would and frankly there are quite a
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
few restaurant owners that have
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
seen the light and are already paying
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
people well over the current minimum
 
04:28:02.080 --> 04:28:03.030 align:start position:0%
people well over the current minimum
wage

04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
wage
 
04:28:05.590 --> 04:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
so um even though they earn tips on top
 
04:28:05.600 --> 04:28:06.389 align:start position:0%
so um even though they earn tips on top
so

04:28:06.389 --> 04:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
i support the uh concept i will oppose
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
the motion thank you
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i will reiterate
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
that i did write this bill
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
with input and i did recently work for
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
an organization that was fighting for
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh ditching the subminimum wage at the
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
federal level i did not earn any money
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
to do any of this work but for i just
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
want to be upfront about that
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
in case anyone has any concerns um so
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
there is the caveat
 
04:28:41.279 --> 04:28:43.670 align:start position:0%
there is the caveat
um

04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
there are actually eight states
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
to counter the main
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh the state of maine argument eight
 
04:28:54.149 --> 04:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
states who have ditched the minimum sub
 
04:28:57.030 --> 04:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for all of their workers
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
it has been great for them
 
04:29:03.110 --> 04:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
they include the super woke states of
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
nevada that was a joke by the way nevada
 
04:29:09.110 --> 04:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
montana minnesota hawaii oregon
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
washington alaska and california and by
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
the way california is now considering an
 
04:29:13.520 --> 04:29:14.710 align:start position:0%
the way california is now considering an
18

04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
18
 
04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh which i find interesting
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh the darden corporation board chair in
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
a call with investors
 
04:29:23.920 --> 04:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
a call with investors
said

04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
when asked about
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
this movement to ditch the subminimum
 
04:29:29.040 --> 04:29:30.229 align:start position:0%
this movement to ditch the subminimum
wage

04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
wage
 
04:29:32.309 --> 04:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
said actually the restaurants in those
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
states were better
 
04:29:34.479 --> 04:29:35.429 align:start position:0%
states were better
so

04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind and i have
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
if i go any further i'm probably just
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
really repeating my testimony i just
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
want to make the point though too i just
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%

email
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
there are instances since we met
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the actually one of them may have
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
been in the news
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
former restaurant worker testify that in
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
fact she had not been paid what she
 
04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
thought she was supposed to be making
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
not even just the tips but even the base
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
wage and it was very confusing
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
and then i realized later that
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
i hope he doesn't representative
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
seaworth was talking about the same
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant and very dismayed with their
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
business practices
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
also this past week it was in the news
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite restaurants here in
 
04:30:28.880 --> 04:30:30.149 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite restaurants here in
concord

04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
concord
 
04:30:30.159 --> 04:30:32.389 align:start position:0%
concord
uh

04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
held back 62 000
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
worth of tips
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
that are owed to those workers
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
i know that the majority of restaurants
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
in this state are wonderful
 
04:30:47.429 --> 04:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
with great business practices they
 
04:30:49.110 --> 04:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
probably treat their employees well and
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a tough time to be a
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner or bookkeeper
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not naive to that
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
but this is an antiquated system from
 
04:31:01.269 --> 04:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
the jim crow era that really has to go
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we were smart about it when we
 
04:31:05.110 --> 04:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
ditched the subminimum wage for workers
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
04:31:09.750 --> 04:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a similar advancement and
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
just doing what is the right thing in my
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
opinion but
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
even financially it's better but i'd
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
like to make a suggestion
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
knowing that there are two recent
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
really awful stories and knowing that
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated time for the
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant in
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
industry and for workers would you be
 
04:31:33.269 --> 04:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
open to interim study on this topic on
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.120 --> 04:31:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
and of course someone making the motion
 
04:31:58.389 --> 04:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh itl could withdraw the motion as well
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just throwing this out there because
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
it does affect
 
04:32:01.920 --> 04:32:02.870 align:start position:0%
it does affect
um

04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
well at least two of us this is in our
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
district the issue that's growing and i
 
04:32:10.870 --> 04:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the confusion around this
 
04:32:10.880 --> 04:32:11.750 align:start position:0%
believe that the confusion around this
issue

04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
for even restaurant owners and workers i
 
04:32:15.750 --> 04:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know if it's not going to pass i do
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
think we should look at pay
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
and today's market and also i'll add
 
04:32:27.510 --> 04:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
servers tipped workers who do make great
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
money they tend to be at the higher end
 
04:32:31.840 --> 04:32:33.189 align:start position:0%
money they tend to be at the higher end
restaurants

04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
they tend to not share those tips with
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
plenty of our restaurants do not do that
 
04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
well i wish they did this wouldn't you
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
know them i doubt anybody would have any
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
problems with the way things are going
 
04:32:47.680 --> 04:32:50.870 align:start position:0%
problems with the way things are going
but

04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
we need to level the playing field
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
because this
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
type of law would in fact
 
04:32:56.960 --> 04:32:59.510 align:start position:0%
type of law would in fact
not

04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
the restaurants who have
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
the easy ability and flexibility are in
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
competition with the mom-and-pop places
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
and if we don't level the playing field
 
04:33:10.629 --> 04:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
it actually hurts the entire industry
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
and as much as i like the free market
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
and adam smith and all those analogies
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
our free market doesn't always account
 
04:33:18.719 --> 04:33:19.830 align:start position:0%
our free market doesn't always account
for

04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
greed and misunderstanding you know for
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
those of us who see
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
not a worker shortage but a wage
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
shortage or a benefit shortage
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is definitely one of those issues
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
that deserves discussion because it ends
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
up hurting our small businesses this mom
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
and pop restaurants the most
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i spoke more than i meant to but i
 
04:33:42.150 --> 04:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make the case that you
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
could withdraw the motion and go for
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
interim study but i respect the chair
 
04:34:08.470 --> 04:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr check
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to point out and it does fit
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
in with the
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
immediately previous comments there are
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
two issues here one is the policy and
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've had bills
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
addressing this policy before and
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
there's a policy debate
 
04:34:26.561 --> 04:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
there's a policy debate
that

04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:29.189 --> 04:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
people in this room come on one side or
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to also focus on the specific
 
04:34:36.551 --> 04:34:36.561 align:start position:0%
language of this bill
 
04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
during the testimony there was
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
i i heard a lot of confusion i didn't
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
hear the answers
 
04:34:42.719 --> 04:34:43.750 align:start position:0%
hear the answers
um

04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
this takes
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
the 279 22 what's a paragraph in current
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
law and replaces it with a sentence
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i i saw a lot of
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
people wondering what exactly that would
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
do i mean obviously it's intended to
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
address the tipped wage
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
but what else does it do when all that
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
language just vanishes
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
from the books
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason
 
04:35:16.390 --> 04:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the policy discussion but i
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
would also
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
warn that i i'm not i haven't seen any
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
amended language to address that i
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
haven't heard answers as to exactly what
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the implications or fan out of this is
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
so i would caution the committee um
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
those who
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
are might advocate for an otp on
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
from that angle
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that was brought up
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
with the subminimum wage is under no
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances in a if you're a server
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
the server minimum wage is down in the
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
three dollar
 
04:35:56.160 --> 04:35:57.029 align:start position:0%
three dollar
area

04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
under no circumstances can they never a
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
server never get paid less than 7.25 an
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
hour which is the federal minimum wage
 
04:36:03.760 --> 04:36:04.789 align:start position:0%
hour which is the federal minimum wage
so

04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:07.109 --> 04:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
to say that somebody can make three
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
dollars and whatever the number is 23
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
cents or whatever it is right now
 
04:36:13.269 --> 04:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
that is not supposed to happen if it
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
does happen then the
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
employer is supposed to make up the
 
04:36:16.799 --> 04:36:17.750 align:start position:0%
employer is supposed to make up the
difference

04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:36:19.510 --> 04:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we have seen a couple of instances
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
in the news recently
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
about a couple
 
04:36:22.719 --> 04:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
about a couple
individuals

04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
those were perfectly handled by the dol
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're supposed to be
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
doing they
 
04:36:31.750 --> 04:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
created the settlement
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
as to uh supply and demand in the free
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
market uh which i espouse uh frequently
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's not an analogy that's economic
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
principles that's
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
free market does work and supply and
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative hoff
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
and then i'd like to speak and then i'll
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
call you again representative and then
 
04:37:01.279 --> 04:37:02.709 align:start position:0%
call you again representative and then
okay

04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:04.629 --> 04:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
all kinds of it's all over the place
 
04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative huff and let the people
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
who spoke first representative hoff
 
04:37:08.400 --> 04:37:09.830 align:start position:0%
who spoke first representative hoff
representative

04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
adagent and representative schultz
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i was just
 
04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
pointing that your microphone wasn't on
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i don't want to
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
specifically direct this question that
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte but it was
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
something that he mentioned
 
04:37:26.719 --> 04:37:27.590 align:start position:0%
something that he mentioned
um

04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes it is true that
 
04:37:30.320 --> 04:37:31.269 align:start position:0%
yes it is true that
the

04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
that a server cannot be paid less than
 
04:37:34.949 --> 04:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
725 an hour
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
04:37:37.750 --> 04:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'd ask a question if anybody wants to
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
answer it then if that's the case what's
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
the point of having a subminimum wage if
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
a person cannot legally paid be paid
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
less than the minimum wage
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of having this
 
04:37:51.189 --> 04:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
at three dollars that the employer has
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
to make up the difference to anyways it
 
04:37:57.910 --> 04:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
just seems like putting a hat on a hat i
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
can't really square that as to why it
 
04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to keep a subminimum
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
wage if they can't be paid less than the
 
04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
when i speak i'll give you an answer
 
04:38:06.561 --> 04:38:07.830 align:start position:0%
when i speak i'll give you an answer
representative

04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:07.840 --> 04:38:10.390 align:start position:0%
representative
tui

04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
tui
 
04:38:10.400 --> 04:38:11.670 align:start position:0%
tui
yeah

04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
when i was uh
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
younger a long time ago the customary
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
tip was 10
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
over the years that evolved and it
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
became 15
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
now it's 20
 
04:38:29.709 --> 04:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
more of the
 
04:38:29.719 --> 04:38:31.269 align:start position:0%
more of the
responsibility

04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
to pay a server
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
falls in
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
in the customer's hand now
 
04:38:40.390 --> 04:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't stop
 
04:38:42.789 --> 04:38:42.799 align:start position:0%
tipping all it does is
 
04:38:42.799 --> 04:38:44.230 align:start position:0%
tipping all it does is
maybe

04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
create a mechanism where
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
the employer would be more responsible
 
04:38:51.510 --> 04:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
for paying the employee
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
and le and the customer less responsible
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
but still responsible
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%

04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
schultz after
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman we were um
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
the representative schultz has sent us
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:39:26.879 --> 04:39:28.470 align:start position:0%
the um
yes

04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
you read it from the patch yes
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
it is illegal to split tips with your
 
04:39:33.279 --> 04:39:34.551 align:start position:0%
it is illegal to split tips with your
supervisors

04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
supervisors
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's also illegal to split tips with the
 
04:39:37.990 --> 04:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
back of the house
 
04:39:40.628 --> 04:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
it's also illegal to split tips
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:44.958 --> 04:39:46.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
trying to redistribute the tips to other
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
members of your employees who do not
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
earn them
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
would be a direct violation of state and
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
federal wage laws
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
so we can take that if anybody wants to
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
read the tip regulations under the fair
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
labor standards act
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
it was just rewritten april
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
and any
 
04:40:09.760 --> 04:40:12.310 align:start position:0%
and any
responsible

04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
business owner that has
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
a restaurant would know that you can't
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
i did speak to the department of labor
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
about this but i'm going to let
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
representative schultz speak and then i
 
04:40:26.230 --> 04:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
will tell you about my conversation with
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
the department of labor
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
representatives i'd rather hear what you
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate this discussion very
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
much i just want to clarify a couple
 
04:40:34.320 --> 04:40:35.190 align:start position:0%
much i just want to clarify a couple
things

04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:40:37.270 --> 04:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy that i forgot more
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
that i was going to say because
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
i've talked i've spoken a lot but
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
the um to answer representative
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
adjutant's question about why does this
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
system exist
 
04:40:47.520 --> 04:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
system exist
um

04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
there are so many articles on this so
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
all you need to do is google the phrase
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
jim crow and sub minimum and you will
 
04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
get a slew of well-documented
 
04:41:00.080 --> 04:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
get a slew of well-documented
well-substantiated

04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
well-substantiated
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
accounts of why and it is from
 
04:41:09.920 --> 04:41:09.930 align:start position:0%
the post-slavery era and how do we
 
04:41:09.930 --> 04:41:11.350 align:start position:0%
the post-slavery era and how do we
[Music]

04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
bring all these folks who weren't
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
getting paid and doing work that they
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
felt needed to be done as slaves and not
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
pay them well we will make them
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
dependent on
 
04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh if they are well behaved and nice
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
then their whole wages will be paced
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
on their tips
 
04:41:33.430 --> 04:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
tips were already accustomed here anyway
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
as they were in europe and other places
 
04:41:35.280 --> 04:41:36.150 align:start position:0%
as they were in europe and other places
but

04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:41:39.910 --> 04:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
their entire pay at that point was zero
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
officially and they literally in a very
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
in a variety of jobs uh famously
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
as um
 
04:41:49.510 --> 04:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
the pullman company the train company
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
can um in various roles
 
04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
and in lots of restaurants especially in
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
the south
 
04:41:59.030 --> 04:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh at some point i haven't memorized
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
what year
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
they thought well you know
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we should pay something and so
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
at that point i believe it is in the
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
last hundred years
 
04:42:12.868 --> 04:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
the decision was made that paying zero
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
was ridiculous so that's good but then
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
they made the sub minimum wage category
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
for that maybe there had been some
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
minimum wage categories already for
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
workers who with disabilities i don't
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
know the history of that but certainly
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
for tipped wage workers
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
that was the history
 
04:42:28.320 --> 04:42:29.590 align:start position:0%
that was the history
and

04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:32.550 --> 04:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
it still means that their pay is
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
dependent on
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
the grace and kindness or feasibility of
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
their customers
 
04:42:41.830 --> 04:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i didn't even get into the issues
 
04:42:44.310 --> 04:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
that that raises with sexual harassment
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
because that has happened to some tipped
 
04:42:48.150 --> 04:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
wage workers here in new hampshire and a
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
lot of other problems
 
04:42:49.680 --> 04:42:50.550 align:start position:0%
lot of other problems
but

04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
most servers get a paycheck that still
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
says zero
 
04:42:57.270 --> 04:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
and so from the slavery days to today
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's only gone from zero
 
04:43:02.310 --> 04:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
dollars to three dollars and 27 cents
 
04:43:03.910 --> 04:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
and while the law i appreciate the
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
clarification on the law of what and how
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
people are paid
 
04:43:07.920 --> 04:43:09.110 align:start position:0%
people are paid
um

04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to fix all of these
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
confusions would be to just get rid of
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
it and pay people the same way we pay
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
them everywhere else not to get rid of
 
04:43:18.718 --> 04:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
them everywhere else not to get rid of
tips

04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
tips
 
04:43:22.230 --> 04:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
i would say fifteen dollars plus tips on
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
top but for the purpose of this bill it
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be seven dollars and 25 cents
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and this discussion is so good it
 
04:43:35.830 --> 04:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
also would be great isn't it it's an
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else like to speak
 
04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
all right first off
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
and answer your question representative
 
04:43:47.910 --> 04:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
addison um
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
i suggest you talk to your
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation and do
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
something in washington and get rid of
 
04:43:55.990 --> 04:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
the sub-minimum wage is a good start
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
and then we can tackle that here
 
04:44:02.070 --> 04:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
um secondly i knew i figured this
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
question would come up about dose of
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
egos and this
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
this was a federal
 
04:44:09.120 --> 04:44:10.628 align:start position:0%
this was a federal
dol

04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
dol
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
investigation in vine
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
their laws are different from ours
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
that what they do
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
would not have is not illegal in new
 
04:44:22.000 --> 04:44:23.190 align:start position:0%
would not have is not illegal in new
hampshire

04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:44:25.750 --> 04:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
i was one of the co-authors of the
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
new tipping bill
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
former representative murphy and
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative simmons
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
believe it or not we sat down at a bar
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
with a couple beers and we figured out
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
the new tipping laws because our tipping
 
04:44:39.350 --> 04:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
laws were so
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
out of date
 
04:44:41.440 --> 04:44:43.350 align:start position:0%
out of date
and

04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
it came up because you know a bar has a
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
spittoon if you will or some kind of a
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
jar behind
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
and and the bartenders all put their
 
04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
tips in at the end of the night and then
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
give them out
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
that was illegal five years ago six
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
so we
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
changed the law to allow for tip pooling
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
and tip sharing
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
the number one thing in new hampshire
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
which has always been adhered to is tips
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
are the
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
are owned by the employees never by the
 
04:45:14.638 --> 04:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
are owned by the employees never by the
employers

04:45:16.070 --> 04:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
employers
 
04:45:17.830 --> 04:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
period and the story don't even bring it
 
04:45:17.840 --> 04:45:18.628 align:start position:0%
period and the story don't even bring it
up

04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:45:18.638 --> 04:45:19.350 align:start position:0%
up
okay

04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:45:19.360 --> 04:45:20.470 align:start position:0%
okay
however

04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
with the new law that we did change
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
you can have an agreement if you want
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
amongst the employees if they choose to
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
say look we will give the the waitresses
 
04:45:31.270 --> 04:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
will give a certain amount of money for
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
person to sit you down i can't think of
 
04:45:40.948 --> 04:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
hostess or whatever so that that is
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
allowed so there is some of those things
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
that are allowed but when it comes to
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
this dose of me goes understand
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
um if you ever been there i love the
 
04:45:51.200 --> 04:45:52.550 align:start position:0%
um if you ever been there i love the
place

04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
you start here you order you go down you
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
watch them make it
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then it's there and there's a tip
 
04:45:57.120 --> 04:45:58.070 align:start position:0%
and then it's there and there's a tip
jar

04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
jar
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
and the managers work just as hard right
 
04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
next to
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
the employees
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they felt that they were following
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
the law which they were according to new
 
04:46:06.560 --> 04:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
the law which they were according to new
hampshire

04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
but apparently we have some
 
04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
disagreements with the feds on that
 
04:46:11.920 --> 04:46:13.590 align:start position:0%
disagreements with the feds on that
um

04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
so just to just want to clarify what
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
that situation i asked
 
04:46:19.750 --> 04:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
rudy ogden
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
assistant bishop ogden
 
04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
why this came about he had not heard
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
from the feds about this and why the
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
investigation was brought forth
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
but it was not brought forth by the
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify some of those
 
04:46:33.680 --> 04:46:37.350 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify some of those
things

04:46:37.350 --> 04:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
did i get the tipping law correct
 
04:46:39.760 --> 04:46:48.708 align:start position:0%
did i get the tipping law correct
yes

04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:50.550 --> 04:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
because believe it or not a employer
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
came in front of us and sat in front of
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
the committee because they were finding
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
the department of labor
 
04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
for again having that one
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
container behind the bar where all the
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
bartenders a very busy place would take
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
all the tips and put it in at the end of
 
04:47:03.990 --> 04:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
night share it they got fine that was
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
against the law well that was being done
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
in every single
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
establishment in new hampshire at the
 
04:47:07.920 --> 04:47:09.270 align:start position:0%
establishment in new hampshire at the
time

04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:47:09.280 --> 04:47:10.070 align:start position:0%
time
so

04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
since then i don't believe there's been
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
any issues so
 
04:47:15.510 --> 04:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to do to say regarding
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
all the things that were either asked or
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
brought up representative cahill uh yes
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr that just raises the
 
04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
question in my mind and i understand the
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
managers are working hard and the
 
04:47:28.868 --> 04:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
hostess and everything it's customary to
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
tip out but are they paid
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
are they working for tipped wages or
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
something beyond that the people who
 
04:47:35.120 --> 04:47:35.830 align:start position:0%
something beyond that the people who
were

04:47:35.830 --> 04:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:47:38.550 --> 04:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
as as far as federal law inappropriately
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking a share of the tips
 
04:47:43.590 --> 04:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
again i i don't know federal law as well
 
04:47:44.948 --> 04:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
as i know new hampshire law but
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
according to what we did
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
if the agreement was made with the
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
employees to do that those managers were
 
04:47:51.910 --> 04:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
working right with them
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
and they agreed to that that is legal in
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
new haven that would have been legal in
 
04:47:57.510 --> 04:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i don't know all the
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
specific specifics of the federal case
 
04:48:00.868 --> 04:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
just know what we all read in the
 
04:48:00.878 --> 04:48:02.150 align:start position:0%
just know what we all read in the
newspaper

04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
newspaper
 
04:48:02.160 --> 04:48:03.190 align:start position:0%
newspaper
okay

04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative huff
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair in the interest uh
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
to representative sullivan would it be
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to move the previous
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
questions because i'm sure we'll have
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
this debate more than a million million
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
more times
 
04:48:19.590 --> 04:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
um i would ask you to hold that motion
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
at this point are we all uh is everyone
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
spoken who would like to speak
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
what am i looking at oh gosh um
 
04:48:29.110 --> 04:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative and then we'll close it
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
up if okay
 
04:48:32.550 --> 04:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just want to
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
clarify for the record that the question
 
04:48:38.550 --> 04:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
that i asked was facetious oh i'm sorry
 
04:48:41.110 --> 04:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i just yeah i couldn't square in my
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
head how it made sense to dig a trench
 
04:48:46.868 --> 04:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
at 3 27 when the actual battle line is
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
at 7 25. uh that was
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
the kind of open-ended question there
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
understood and thank you i couldn't see
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
through your monarch's mask the smile on
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
your face that you were giving me
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.798 --> 04:49:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
very

very
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
very good debate there is a motion on
 
04:49:10.628 --> 04:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:11.910 --> 04:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
unless it's going to be withdrawn the
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is as inexpensive to
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislate seeing no other hands
 
04:49:19.190 --> 04:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
seeing no other motions
 
04:49:21.750 --> 04:49:21.760 align:start position:0%

heart as to trying to keep fair the
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
reality is um
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
an employer is more than free to express
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
his opinion as to how he would like to
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%

right of free speech or freedom to

chairman
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
respond to representative huff's
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
statement i would like to
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
to agree with him that
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
employees have their employers
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
have their
 
04:52:36.958 --> 04:52:38.708 align:start position:0%
have their
right

04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
to their free speech however
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
i am going to support this bill because
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
it will eliminate
 
04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
employers requiring
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
employees to attend
 
04:52:51.760 --> 04:52:56.070 align:start position:0%
employees to attend
anti-union

04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.080 --> 04:52:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
videos

04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
videos
 
04:52:58.560 --> 04:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
videos
and

04:52:59.670 --> 04:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:01.590 --> 04:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that's the
 
04:53:05.110 --> 04:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
crust of this bill is to
 
04:53:09.030 --> 04:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative um
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
out of gentoomy
 
04:53:16.628 --> 04:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh representative
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
huff is correct in that the intention of
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is to uh level the playing
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
field uh very often and i've worked for
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
several companies that uh have done this
 
04:53:29.190 --> 04:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh show up the first day uh you're hit
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
with that video where very clearly
 
04:53:32.550 --> 04:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
people who've never worked for that
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
company and are very obviously actors
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
um are telling you about how unions are
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
terrible and they'll steal all your
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
money and
 
04:53:40.320 --> 04:53:41.350 align:start position:0%
money and
um

04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
it there's something about being on the
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
clock during those meetings uh that
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
really enforces
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
that to an employee
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
really just want to make sure this is
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
fair i really just want to make sure the
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
level level
 
04:53:57.270 --> 04:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
playing field exists
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
um i think this is a good bill
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
i would definitely support a not to pass
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
motion uh and i hope the itl fails so we
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
04:54:05.280 --> 04:54:06.470 align:start position:0%
can do that
um

04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have as much more to say on that
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative toomey
 
04:54:13.360 --> 04:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative toomey
yeah

04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
this has three components to it and i
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
kind of wish it didn't
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know one it's
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
an employer can't lock out employees
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh they would have to allow striking
 
04:54:27.360 --> 04:54:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh they would have to allow striking
employees

04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
to uh come back to work
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then the other one has to do with uh
 
04:54:34.400 --> 04:54:36.230 align:start position:0%
and then the other one has to do with uh
forced

04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
forced
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
attendance meetings uh relative to uh
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
relative to uh having a union
 
04:54:46.150 --> 04:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'll just limit my my discussion to the
 
04:54:46.160 --> 04:54:47.270 align:start position:0%
i'll just limit my my discussion to the
last

04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
you know i i
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
i think has been said before today you
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
know it's a good idea to keep
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh your
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
proposals uh simple and
 
04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.350 --> 04:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
what happens very often
 
04:55:05.360 --> 04:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
what happens very often
uh

04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:06.240 --> 04:55:07.190 align:start position:0%
uh
if

04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
there's discussion of having a union all
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
of a sudden
 
04:55:11.360 --> 04:55:12.948 align:start position:0%
of a sudden
management

04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
management
 
04:55:14.550 --> 04:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
brings in
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
paid consultants and they hold meetings
 
04:55:17.200 --> 04:55:17.910 align:start position:0%
paid consultants and they hold meetings
and

04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
employees are required to go to those
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
meetings and in fact they're coerced
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
to listen
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
and first of all
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
if people decide
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
or want to decide whether they want to
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
as a group
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
bargain individually or they want to
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
bargain as a group
 
04:55:40.628 --> 04:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
that's their business it's not the
 
04:55:43.110 --> 04:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
employer's business
 
04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:55:45.990 --> 04:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're intervening
 
04:55:46.000 --> 04:55:47.830 align:start position:0%
they're intervening
into

04:55:47.830 --> 04:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:55:50.550 --> 04:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
a process that should be handled solely
 
04:55:52.550 --> 04:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
by employees
 
04:55:52.560 --> 04:55:56.150 align:start position:0%
by employees
and

04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:56.160 --> 04:55:58.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
04:56:04.948 --> 04:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
employees refuse to go to those meetings
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
they can fire that employee they have
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
the ability to hire fire promote demote
 
04:56:14.550 --> 04:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh transfer
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
put letters in people's files and they
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
do that when people
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
try to organize
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
you know if if an employer wants to
 
04:56:26.878 --> 04:56:27.670 align:start position:0%
you know if if an employer wants to
give

04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
give
 
04:56:29.830 --> 04:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
employees their opinion about whether
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
there should be a union
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
they can send a letter
 
04:56:38.788 --> 04:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
to employees and and have the employees
 
04:56:39.830 --> 04:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
04:56:41.830 --> 04:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
pros and cons of it but when they bring
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:47.910 --> 04:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
coerce them
 
04:56:50.070 --> 04:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
intimidate them
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
in a process that should be handled
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
solely by the employees themselves
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.190 --> 04:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:57:03.200 --> 04:57:04.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
just responding to a few comments and a
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
couple points um currently uh we
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
it appears that this would be
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
an attempt to add on to or rewrite
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
portions of the new
 
04:57:18.868 --> 04:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
national labor relations act or even the
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
railway labor act
 
04:57:20.638 --> 04:57:21.910 align:start position:0%
railway labor act
um

04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:23.910 --> 04:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
we have things called collective bargain
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements um
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
that if this kindness
 
04:57:29.840 --> 04:57:30.628 align:start position:0%
that if this kindness
these

04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:57:32.708 --> 04:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
are big enough issues you could even i
 
04:57:32.718 --> 04:57:34.628 align:start position:0%
are big enough issues you could even i
suppose

04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
get those into your collective
 
04:57:39.990 --> 04:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
being forced to watch
 
04:57:45.350 --> 04:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
this video or that video i can tell you
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
annually on an annual basis i have to
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
sit through some uh woke presentations
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
in my annual training that i'd much for
 
04:57:54.948 --> 04:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
not prefer to sit through
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i would point i would
 
04:57:56.798 --> 04:57:58.590 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i would point i would
make

04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
is this bill is prohibiting anti-union
 
04:58:04.470 --> 04:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
activities by employers are we going to
 
04:58:06.070 --> 04:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
have a companion bill that's going to be
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
prohibiting anti-employer activities by
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
labor unions
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
i am in favor of the itil motion thank
 
04:58:11.840 --> 04:58:14.628 align:start position:0%
i am in favor of the itil motion thank
you

04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i just
 
04:58:23.670 --> 04:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make one one small
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
point um
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
of what our honorable member from
 
04:58:30.070 --> 04:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
hillsborough said
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
he was talking about the employers and
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
he said it's not their business
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard the expression um
 
04:58:48.550 --> 04:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know the system isn't very good but
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's the best one we have there's no one
 
04:58:53.110 --> 04:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
better one that has been devised
 
04:58:54.628 --> 04:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
i look at this the same thing when it
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
comes to
 
04:58:58.628 --> 04:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
employees establishing a collective
 
04:59:01.110 --> 04:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
bargaining and creating a union
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're right representative toomey
 
04:59:06.550 --> 04:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things that go on
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
when a
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
company is looking at having their uni
 
04:59:13.750 --> 04:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
their employees organized are despicable
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
but neither one has clean hands
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.708 --> 04:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
videos brought by management
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
showing up to employees doors
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
to converse to even some issues with
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
card checks
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
um all these other things that go on and
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a great system and some of the
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
things that go on
 
04:59:34.718 --> 04:59:35.910 align:start position:0%
things that go on
um

04:59:35.910 --> 04:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:59:38.230 --> 04:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know some of you are too young for
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
this a famous movie norma ray
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
um and some of the things that did go on
 
04:59:44.000 --> 04:59:44.708 align:start position:0%
um and some of the things that did go on
that

04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
have gone on
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
and uh both parties could do it better
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
no doubt
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these things shouldn't
 
04:59:52.320 --> 04:59:53.190 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these things shouldn't
happen

04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
i would love to have seen
 
04:59:55.680 --> 04:59:56.788 align:start position:0%
i would love to have seen
these

04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
for both
 
04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
both groups
 
05:00:01.670 --> 05:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
be more equal
 
05:00:03.430 --> 05:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
both parties have to do this both
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
parties have to adhere to that
 
05:00:05.600 --> 05:00:06.390 align:start position:0%
parties have to adhere to that
um

05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are certain rules with uh
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
nlrb has certain
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
rules and such and how you go about this
 
05:00:18.550 --> 05:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
i just think this is one sided then you
 
05:00:22.230 --> 05:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
have to look at both sides um and if
 
05:00:24.390 --> 05:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to set a law
 
05:00:24.400 --> 05:00:25.590 align:start position:0%
you're going to set a law
requiring

05:00:25.590 --> 05:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
05:00:28.390 --> 05:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
employer not do this and you have to
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
you have an equal law said says the
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
organizer can't do that
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
moves out of sullivan
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
then results
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to keep in mind
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a power a very distinct
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
power differential between individual
 
05:00:44.400 --> 05:00:45.590 align:start position:0%
power differential between individual
employees

05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
and their employer
 
05:00:50.310 --> 05:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
and in the organizing process what you
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
have is a group of individuals who are
 
05:00:54.628 --> 05:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if they want to act
 
05:00:54.638 --> 05:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if they want to act
collectively

05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
but before they actually have that
 
05:00:58.958 --> 05:01:00.230 align:start position:0%
but before they actually have that
election

05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
they are at a distinct power
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
disadvantage to the employer
 
05:01:05.920 --> 05:01:08.150 align:start position:0%
disadvantage to the employer
and

05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
issues like this are addressed by this
 
05:01:13.830 --> 05:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
bill are important to maintain that
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
or to protect those employees from a
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
hostile employer and basically
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
it was it was mentioned that perhaps
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
these issues can be placed in a
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
not if you don't have one yet
 
05:01:29.280 --> 05:01:30.390 align:start position:0%
not if you don't have one yet
um

05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
you've got to have a
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
a bargaining unit before you can have a
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement
 
05:01:35.600 --> 05:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement
and

05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
there are companies out there that we've
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
all heard about that are
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
working really hard to make sure and
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
there are companies that will close down
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
facilities rather than allow them to
 
05:01:47.360 --> 05:01:48.550 align:start position:0%
facilities rather than allow them to
unionize

05:01:48.550 --> 05:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
unionize
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and so it is a very hostile
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
environment for unions these days
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is why
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislation like this
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.200 --> 05:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
i have a couple
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative schultz love that
 
05:02:05.280 --> 05:02:07.350 align:start position:0%
representative schultz love that
turcotte

05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just want to
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
briefly mention the fact that especially
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
since the reagan era
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
and what happened between reagan and the
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
air traffic controllers
 
05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
began a trend that hasn't stopped and
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is to severely eroding the rights
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
of workers to
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
organize and unite
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
which by the way is on the list of human
 
05:02:33.360 --> 05:02:35.110 align:start position:0%
which by the way is on the list of human
rights

05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
rights
 
05:02:37.350 --> 05:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
what every human should be able to do in
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
this case every worker should be able to
 
05:02:41.670 --> 05:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
do collectively organize
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
but i think we have gone so far astray
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
and it correlates to the decline of the
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
middle class and the difficulty
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
for younger generations to own a home
 
05:02:57.590 --> 05:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
pay for student loans etc
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
i i think union membership in this
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
country is
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:03:04.550 --> 05:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
more definitely more than half of what
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
it was when i became aware
 
05:03:11.110 --> 05:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
and it's it's really been hurtful and
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
you can see this in you know i love
 
05:03:15.270 --> 05:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
talking about anything woke it's always
 
05:03:16.948 --> 05:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
an interesting discussion
 
05:03:18.628 --> 05:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
but to
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
we thought well woke companies amazon
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
and starbucks
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
who have targeted especially
 
05:03:28.628 --> 05:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
liberal-leaning humans to be their
 
05:03:28.638 --> 05:03:29.830 align:start position:0%
liberal-leaning humans to be their
customers

05:03:29.830 --> 05:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
customers
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
they have been actively doing these
 
05:03:31.760 --> 05:03:33.030 align:start position:0%
they have been actively doing these
tactics

05:03:33.030 --> 05:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
tactics
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
and to the detriment of their workers
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
because i don't believe
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
for the most part that that any union is
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
quote unquote against the company if
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
they were
 
05:03:46.150 --> 05:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't do a very good job as
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
workers in representing those workers i
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
think that what it is for
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
is for the power differential to be able
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
to listen to and it's not always about
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
pay or benefits it's often about little
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
things that maybe management hasn't
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
but i i believe um this type of bill
 
05:04:09.990 --> 05:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
returns to our society
 
05:04:12.868 --> 05:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
what we've lost over the last
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
35 40 years and it's overdue
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%

chair
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
a bill we've talked about a bit before
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
and i think the the issues here this is
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
pruned down to just two instances
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
where i think many of us might agree
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
the employees who had earned their time
 
05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
lost it through no fault of their own
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
through actions for which they had no
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
control no opportunity
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
to make a difference in this no
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use the time before their
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
employment terminated
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
and in one case actually they continued
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
working just for a different company on
 
05:22:17.590 --> 05:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
the very same job something that doesn't
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
normally happen
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i think the vast majority of cases
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
in that situation what's done is the
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
previous employer makes an arrangement
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
with the new employer to accept the
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
employees not only the employees the
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
trained workers but their vacation time
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
their earned time pto whatever the term
 
05:22:34.958 --> 05:22:35.670 align:start position:0%
their earned time pto whatever the term
is

05:22:35.670 --> 05:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's what's normally done it's not
 
05:22:40.470 --> 05:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
required under new hampshire law
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
and when it doesn't happen
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
what can happen is people lose
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
whatever they had earned it just
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
suddenly vanishes from their pay stub
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
and they're starting from scratch
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh there was a con there was a
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
discussion with deputy ogden at our
 
05:22:56.798 --> 05:22:57.670 align:start position:0%
discussion with deputy ogden at our
hearing

05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
and that the department has a means of
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
going after these companies but that's
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
only if their policy had been stated
 
05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
that they do pay or transfer the time
 
05:23:08.788 --> 05:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
when the policy says
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh at termination the term you know
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
nothing is paid out
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
then that's that's the uh prevailing uh
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's the ruling so in the case
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
of the i think there were five people
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
from one one place who did go through
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
the process
 
05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh they had
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
they they fought they lost they they had
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
their game their claims were denied
 
05:23:31.270 --> 05:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
because of this situation so this bill
 
05:23:34.150 --> 05:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
this they amended as as amended
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
would require that the employer
 
05:23:39.430 --> 05:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
when this when the company is sold
 
05:23:41.830 --> 05:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
either transfer or pay out
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
the the time that's what that does the
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
other instance the other situation
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
covered by this is a permanent layoff
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
not a not a traditional layoff because
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
that was a concern by the seasonal
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
workers but a permanent layoff you're
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
not going back
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
so if again you have time that you've
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
earned and all of a sudden today's your
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
last day
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
whatever you have would be paid to you
 
05:24:07.110 --> 05:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
because you earned it and you didn't
 
05:24:08.948 --> 05:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity the policy may have
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
been obviously if today's your last date
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
i can't say well let me take my vacation
 
05:24:14.948 --> 05:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
and i'll come back and work another week
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
or two that's not an option so this i
 
05:24:19.350 --> 05:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
think in the interest of fairness
 
05:24:21.430 --> 05:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
we would pass this bill
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that at least these two situations
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
would be covered there was additional
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
language that we talked about before
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
from our former uh member
 
05:24:31.750 --> 05:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
herschel nunez which you know detailed a
 
05:24:34.470 --> 05:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
fairly common practice where if you uh
 
05:24:37.030 --> 05:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
the employee leaves in good standing uh
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
has been a good employee and tells the
 
05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
gives the employer notice that they're
 
05:24:42.548 --> 05:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
leaving they also don't lose but that's
 
05:24:44.230 --> 05:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
not in this bill that's not in this
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
amendment so i request that you
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh pass this uh remembering that the
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
affected negatively are our constituents
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
as well as the business owners
 
05:24:55.360 --> 05:24:56.310 align:start position:0%
as well as the business owners
so

05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:58.548 --> 05:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
i urge you to ought to pass on the
 
05:25:02.310 --> 05:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i would also like to speak on
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment for representative
 
05:25:07.040 --> 05:25:11.190 align:start position:0%
the amendment for representative
sullivan

05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.628 --> 05:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
might be a little premature on this but
 
05:25:14.230 --> 05:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
i just i i guess
 
05:25:14.240 --> 05:25:16.230 align:start position:0%
i just i i guess
um

05:25:16.230 --> 05:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative cahill has been working
 
05:25:19.270 --> 05:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
on this for a long time
 
05:25:22.470 --> 05:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
and he's continually compromised
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted amended and tried to make this
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill workable for uh
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
the parties concerned and i

right our friend mr gervais calls baby
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:01.750 align:start position:0%
right our friend mr gervais calls baby
steps

05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
steps
 
05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
and uh we hope we hope that this will
 
05:28:06.150 --> 05:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
address some issues that people
 
05:28:08.628 --> 05:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
reasonably expect would not happen in
 
05:28:10.150 --> 05:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
the great state of new hampshire in an
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:15.990 --> 05:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
there are numerous cases that are that
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
are claimed every every year every month
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
with the department of labor not all of
 
05:28:22.230 --> 05:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
them are correct all right i think few
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
of them are under this circumstance but
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
these these cases i think we should
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh we should address and that's why i
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
think i put the bill in i hope you will
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:37.990 --> 05:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
05:28:38.000 --> 05:28:38.708 align:start position:0%

05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%

thoroughly appreciate your dedication
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%

05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
some of the circumstances you brought
 
05:28:44.958 --> 05:28:45.910 align:start position:0%
some of the circumstances you brought
forth

05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
forth
 
05:28:47.110 --> 05:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
you have been
 
05:28:49.510 --> 05:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
a gentleman
 
05:28:49.520 --> 05:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
a gentleman
thoughtful

05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
and just a stand-up guy
 
05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
to me and this committee when i was on
 
05:28:56.958 --> 05:28:58.230 align:start position:0%
to me and this committee when i was on
it

it
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
and even when i was off the
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
things you've done
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan you are correct
 
05:29:07.990 --> 05:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.000 --> 05:29:10.628 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
as i explained to you mike
 
05:29:19.750 --> 05:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
the issue comes down to
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
you know line 13 where you you feel that
 
05:29:22.798 --> 05:29:26.948 align:start position:0%
you know line 13 where you you feel that
um

05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
you call them earn time i call them
 
05:29:28.718 --> 05:29:30.470 align:start position:0%
you call them earn time i call them
benefits

05:29:30.470 --> 05:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
constitute wages due
 
05:29:33.840 --> 05:29:35.030 align:start position:0%
constitute wages due
and

05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
there were two members
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
today who have spoken in this chamber
 
05:29:41.350 --> 05:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to tell businesses
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
05:29:43.600 --> 05:29:44.948 align:start position:0%
what to do
and

05:29:44.948 --> 05:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:48.628 --> 05:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
and each
 
05:29:51.510 --> 05:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
business decides that they're going to
 
05:29:51.520 --> 05:29:52.948 align:start position:0%
business decides that they're going to
give

05:29:52.948 --> 05:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
give
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
vacation time
 
05:29:58.390 --> 05:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
holiday time sick time or just some are
 
05:30:00.548 --> 05:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
just saying a certain block of hours do
 
05:30:03.270 --> 05:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
with it what you want
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
but the reason
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
many employers give benefits to their
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
employees such as vacation time or sick
 
05:30:10.558 --> 05:30:11.510 align:start position:0%
employees such as vacation time or sick
time

05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
because they want
 
05:30:16.150 --> 05:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
to be good to their employers
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
employees excuse me and give them a
 
05:30:19.350 --> 05:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
vacation because they come back
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
refreshed it's good for them it's good
 
05:30:23.830 --> 05:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
for for everybody
 
05:30:25.270 --> 05:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
and it's and
 
05:30:26.548 --> 05:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
frankly it's the right thing to do
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
giving people vacation time it's the
 
05:30:29.670 --> 05:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
right thing to do to give people sick
 
05:30:29.680 --> 05:30:30.548 align:start position:0%
right thing to do to give people sick
time

05:30:30.548 --> 05:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:30:34.150 --> 05:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm all in favor of that but
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that it's equal to a
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
cash out payment
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where we have this
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
fundamental disagreement
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
i give someone
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
two weeks vacation
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year and then
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
they quit the first week
 
05:30:54.070 --> 05:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the year and they want two weeks paid
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
vacation or they
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
keep it going
 
05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
three or four years sick time or
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
vacation and then leave for any number
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
of reasons good bad or indifferent and
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
and they want
 
05:31:05.280 --> 05:31:07.030 align:start position:0%
and they want
that

05:31:07.030 --> 05:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
what i consider a benefit and you
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
consider earn time
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
a cash payment for
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that's that's kind of where we
 
05:31:15.760 --> 05:31:16.948 align:start position:0%
and that's that's kind of where we
disagree

05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
these six circumstances you talk about
 
05:31:21.280 --> 05:31:23.670 align:start position:0%
these six circumstances you talk about
um

05:31:23.670 --> 05:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
my apologies
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that you talked about
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that we know well
 
05:31:29.760 --> 05:31:31.030 align:start position:0%
and that we know well
um

05:31:31.030 --> 05:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
are wrong
 
05:31:32.480 --> 05:31:33.430 align:start position:0%
are wrong
when

05:31:33.430 --> 05:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:31:36.070 --> 05:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
one company was sold to another and they
 
05:31:39.510 --> 05:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
didn't bring those benefits over
 
05:31:39.520 --> 05:31:41.270 align:start position:0%
didn't bring those benefits over
okay

05:31:41.270 --> 05:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
and those things you know hopefully we
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
have the laws for or those can be
 
05:31:45.120 --> 05:31:46.868 align:start position:0%
have the laws for or those can be
tweaked

05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
tweaked
 
05:31:46.878 --> 05:31:47.670 align:start position:0%
tweaked
but

05:31:47.670 --> 05:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
again i can commend you michael for just
 
05:31:51.510 --> 05:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
being an
 
05:31:53.430 --> 05:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
absolute stand-up guy
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
on how you've addressed this
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and um how you've treated this
 
05:32:00.310 --> 05:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee with these things
 
05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
the reason why and on two separate
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
occasions i have
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
wanted you to have that opportunity
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
to make your motion and submit your
 
05:32:11.520 --> 05:32:12.868 align:start position:0%
to make your motion and submit your
amendments

05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:32:12.878 --> 05:32:14.548 align:start position:0%
amendments
um

05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
when i knew that probably the votes may
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
not be there
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
because of how you
 
05:32:23.110 --> 05:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know how you
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
just treated this committee and everyone
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
i just can't get over the cash out
 
05:32:27.680 --> 05:32:28.948 align:start position:0%
i just can't get over the cash out
payment

05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
payment
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
and it's just too much for me so it
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
pains me to say i cannot support your
 
05:32:35.670 --> 05:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
your amendment here
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
because i don't think we should be
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
telling everyone these businesses what
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
to do as i said repeating myself
 
05:32:43.510 --> 05:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
a couple members of your party said
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
today about not
 
05:32:47.110 --> 05:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
telling businesses what to do and that's
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
a really tough thing we have here in
 
05:32:50.070 --> 05:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
all right it's trying to be consistent
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
and not trying to tell people what to do
 
05:32:57.670 --> 05:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
but maintain the safety of our
 
05:32:59.350 --> 05:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
employees and such
 
05:33:01.510 --> 05:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
so i apologize michael i cannot uh
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative i cannot support your
 
05:33:04.628 --> 05:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
amendment but
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
i i sure support your your your
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
dedication tenacity and gentleman
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
gentlemen this gentlemanly
 
05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh to me so uh
 
05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
to me sullivan and then michael i'll
 
05:33:20.708 --> 05:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i shouldn't be calling you by your
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
first i apologize representative cahill
 
05:33:25.990 --> 05:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
but it's my opinion yes
 
05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
if you make a deal
 
05:33:35.430 --> 05:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:37.990 --> 05:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't want the government to get
 
05:33:40.240 --> 05:33:42.788 align:start position:0%
if you don't want the government to get
involved

05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
live up to your deal
 
05:33:49.760 --> 05:33:50.548 align:start position:0%
live up to your deal
make

05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:33:52.948 --> 05:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
make it clear there was a discussion of
 
05:33:55.350 --> 05:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility the employer has all the
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the world
 
05:33:58.470 --> 05:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
they can
 
05:34:00.070 --> 05:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
if they decide
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
to give their employees a vacation
 
05:34:05.670 --> 05:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
possibly because their competitors are
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
giving their employees
 
05:34:10.868 --> 05:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
a vacation uh if they
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
decide to do that
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
they can set up all kinds of
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions and and and parameters on
 
05:34:17.920 --> 05:34:18.788 align:start position:0%
restrictions and and and parameters on
it

05:34:18.788 --> 05:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:34:21.030 --> 05:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
we talked about it before
 
05:34:23.590 --> 05:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
you can have use it or lose it
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
you can have a stipulation that you have
 
05:34:29.110 --> 05:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
to work for a full year before you can
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
you can take the vacation you can do all
 
05:34:33.750 --> 05:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
05:34:36.070 --> 05:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
so if you don't want the government to
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
get involved
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the employee
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
live up to your deal make your deal
 
05:34:42.878 --> 05:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
live up to your deal make your deal
clear

05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
and the and
 
05:34:49.030 --> 05:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's what i think
 
05:34:51.510 --> 05:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill is is trying to
 
05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish thank you
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i was listening to you very
 
05:34:58.958 --> 05:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i was listening to you very
carefully

05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
05:35:01.510 --> 05:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
i may have misunderstood but i just want
 
05:35:06.310 --> 05:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
to be sure that uh
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
this is being interpreted correctly as i
 
05:35:10.470 --> 05:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
read this there are only two
 
05:35:12.868 --> 05:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which
 
05:35:15.430 --> 05:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
an employer would be required to
 
05:35:18.150 --> 05:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
pay out the unused vacation
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
one would be a permanent layoff
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the second would be change of
 
05:35:22.320 --> 05:35:23.590 align:start position:0%
and the second would be change of
ownership

05:35:23.590 --> 05:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
05:35:25.350 --> 05:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
um i thought i was hearing you talk
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
about a cash out when someone just
 
05:35:28.708 --> 05:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
decided to leave
 
05:35:28.718 --> 05:35:29.830 align:start position:0%
decided to leave
um

05:35:29.830 --> 05:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative cahill has taken that out
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
05:35:34.548 --> 05:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:35:36.390 --> 05:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's when something happens it's beyond
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
the control of the employee
 
05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
that the employer would be required to
 
05:35:43.350 --> 05:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
pay off the unused vacation time just
 
05:35:45.430 --> 05:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that's clear thank you
 
05:35:46.830 --> 05:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative and then turcotte
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you oops
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
05:35:56.628 --> 05:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate the many years you and i
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
spent together on this committee it's
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
been very i often tell our members that
 
05:36:02.230 --> 05:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
on the first day this is the best
 
05:36:02.240 --> 05:36:03.190 align:start position:0%
on the first day this is the best
committee

05:36:03.190 --> 05:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i stand by that
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the uh
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
the cash out
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh this again
 
05:36:14.310 --> 05:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
the the the proration
 
05:36:16.070 --> 05:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
that happens if you say you've got two
 
05:36:18.390 --> 05:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
weeks and the person quits one week into
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
the job
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
they they have no claim on two weeks
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
because whatever whatever you said they
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
could have would be pro-rated so you the
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
employee the employer is protected
 
05:36:28.400 --> 05:36:29.270 align:start position:0%
employee the employer is protected
against

05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:36:31.350 --> 05:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
that that sort of
 
05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
outsized loss
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:37.440 --> 05:36:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
as

05:36:38.230 --> 05:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
my colleague mr sullivan has
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
indicated this this is very very limited
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
very limited to only two circumstances
 
05:36:46.480 --> 05:36:48.548 align:start position:0%
very limited to only two circumstances
so

05:36:48.548 --> 05:36:48.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is very very small
 
05:36:54.628 --> 05:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
a baby step if i weigh
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
but i think it's the right i think it's
 
05:36:59.110 --> 05:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do uh and i i really
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
i wish they could be retroactive if i
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
ever get this passed you know but i
 
05:37:03.430 --> 05:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
can't get it retroactive because we
 
05:37:05.110 --> 05:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
can't do that but maybe i'll maybe i'll
 
05:37:06.868 --> 05:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
launch a gofundme for those people that
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh that were victims in this and and i
 
05:37:12.628 --> 05:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
know you don't like to contribute
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
05:37:13.680 --> 05:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
representative

05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:17.990 --> 05:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:37:20.868 --> 05:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh i would also echo the chairman's
 
05:37:22.868 --> 05:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
words to representative cahill on his
 
05:37:24.548 --> 05:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
diligence and
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
work on this issue um
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
i i will have to say though that the
 
05:37:31.750 --> 05:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the length of time put
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
into it and the diligence you have put
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
in unfortunately is not for me a reason
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
to pass it when we still have the basic
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
i guess you call it a philosophical
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.240 --> 05:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:37:48.788 --> 05:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
i tend to
 
05:37:51.430 --> 05:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
put bills like this in into my personal
 
05:37:53.350 --> 05:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
life and
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
recently myself and many of our
 
05:37:55.680 --> 05:37:56.708 align:start position:0%
recently myself and many of our
pilots

05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
pilots
 
05:37:59.350 --> 05:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
ran into a situation where we faced
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
possible termination due to
 
05:38:03.510 --> 05:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
not getting back you know accepting the
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate
 
05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
and in that policy or in if that would
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
have happened
 
05:38:14.948 --> 05:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
our contract allows us to build up sick
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
bank to a
 
05:38:18.868 --> 05:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
extraordinary extraordinarily
 
05:38:20.788 --> 05:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
large amount of time
 
05:38:23.350 --> 05:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
had we been terminated
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
all of that would have gone out the
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
window and i can assure you it was a
 
05:38:29.350 --> 05:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
stamped a substantial amount of money
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
but having said that
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's part of our contract
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
we should have the uh the gumption
 
05:38:40.548 --> 05:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
while we're doing our next negotiation
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure that if we are terminated or
 
05:38:46.150 --> 05:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
if we leave or whatever that that sick
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
time will be paid out
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
because i would agree with you in a
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
situation like that
 
05:38:54.470 --> 05:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
if i i should get paid
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
but i also realize it's it's a function
 
05:38:59.830 --> 05:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
of our contract and as it as it is now
 
05:39:01.910 --> 05:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
we don't i mean just that's just the way
 
05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:39:04.708 --> 05:39:04.718 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this many many many
 
05:39:04.718 --> 05:39:06.310 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this many many many
times

05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:39:06.320 --> 05:39:07.270 align:start position:0%
times
the

05:39:07.270 --> 05:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
the policies that a business and uh
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
employer and an employee
 
05:39:14.948 --> 05:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
the policies should be laid out if they
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't that's
 
05:39:16.320 --> 05:39:17.270 align:start position:0%
don't that's
that's

05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:39:19.030 --> 05:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
a joint problem between the employer and
 
05:39:21.030 --> 05:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
employee i as an employee if i'm going
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
to go get hired some place i'm going to
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
want to know what my benefits are what
 
05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
the you know what the issues are what
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
the policy manual is i mean it should be
 
05:39:31.030 --> 05:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
the same for the employer
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
um lastly i'm going to say that although
 
05:39:33.680 --> 05:39:34.470 align:start position:0%
um lastly i'm going to say that although
i

05:39:34.470 --> 05:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:39:34.480 --> 05:39:35.910 align:start position:0%
i
truly

05:39:35.910 --> 05:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
truly
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
love the input we get from mr duvet and
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
mr berkey and mr abbott and the others
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
who frequently come to our committees
 
05:39:48.150 --> 05:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
here we had an individual that was not a
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
lobbyist um registered lobbyists come
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
and speak to us at this last hearing
 
05:39:54.080 --> 05:39:55.350 align:start position:0%
and speak to us at this last hearing
and

05:39:55.350 --> 05:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:55.360 --> 05:39:56.548 align:start position:0%
and
uh

05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
her name was allison something or other
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
i don't even remember she was a a
 
05:40:03.030 --> 05:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
private business owner hr in hr
 
05:40:03.040 --> 05:40:04.628 align:start position:0%
private business owner hr in hr
consulting

05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
consulting
 
05:40:05.910 --> 05:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
and she
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
did one of the best testimonies i've
 
05:40:10.310 --> 05:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
ever heard here she was convincing she
 
05:40:12.628 --> 05:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
was concise it was excellent she was on
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
point she said so many good things i
 
05:40:16.230 --> 05:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
didn't write them all down but
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
the one note i did make on it was
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
she i think she finished her testimony
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
by saying
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
i see this as making law for bad
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
employees at the expense of the good
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
now again i don't remember i'm taking it
 
05:40:30.868 --> 05:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
out of context here probably a little
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
bit but uh
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know between the lobbyists of
 
05:40:36.240 --> 05:40:37.510 align:start position:0%
you know between the lobbyists of
opposition

05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
we've we've had this bill many many
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
times i think we've gone over again many
 
05:40:45.430 --> 05:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
many times the issues that that are with
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
it i
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately cannot support ought to
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:52.320 --> 05:40:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
seaworth

05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
seaworth
 
05:40:55.750 --> 05:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i apologize i already called
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
shows go ahead
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would i would have
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
been fine either way but um
 
05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
just two quick points
 
05:41:06.310 --> 05:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh it is the common practice now that
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh paid time off and and sick leave but
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
you now many places pull them together
 
05:41:11.600 --> 05:41:12.390 align:start position:0%
you now many places pull them together
but

05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
some don't um
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
is earned over time so there wouldn't be
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
especially the distinction of there's
 
05:41:21.190 --> 05:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
really only two cases that this bill
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
would apply to anyway
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
um that wouldn't be
 
05:41:27.910 --> 05:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know a bank of two weeks at the
 
05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
beginning it just wouldn't be it's
 
05:41:31.990 --> 05:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's just not the custom simply for
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
the reason that you stated that if i
 
05:41:36.070 --> 05:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
that um there wouldn't just be a big
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
bank of weeks
 
05:41:43.030 --> 05:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
you earn in a new job unless maybe
 
05:41:44.708 --> 05:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
you're a high executive maybe that works
 
05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
but it typically it is always earned
 
05:41:49.190 --> 05:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
like at a certain rate so many
 
05:41:51.270 --> 05:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know one day of vacation earned for
 
05:41:53.110 --> 05:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
every 30 days or you know whatever that
 
05:41:55.590 --> 05:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
policy is that's very that is the common
 
05:41:58.390 --> 05:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
practice in the in private business
 
05:41:58.400 --> 05:41:59.590 align:start position:0%
practice in the in private business
um

05:41:59.590 --> 05:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm a little
 
05:42:06.000 --> 05:42:07.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm a little
concerned

05:42:07.110 --> 05:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
05:42:08.548 --> 05:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
i i hear
 
05:42:10.470 --> 05:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
two things being said at once and they
 
05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
can't both be true
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
um one is the assertion that this only
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
applies to two cases the permanent
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
layoff and
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
the transfer of business ownership
 
05:42:25.270 --> 05:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
then the other thing and i just heard it
 
05:42:25.280 --> 05:42:26.470 align:start position:0%
then the other thing and i just heard it
repeated

05:42:26.470 --> 05:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
repeated
 
05:42:29.350 --> 05:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
is that as a matter of fact
 
05:42:29.360 --> 05:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
is that as a matter of fact
once

05:42:30.390 --> 05:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
once
 
05:42:33.750 --> 05:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
you accrue vacation time on a pro rated
 
05:42:37.110 --> 05:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
basis that's cash in your pocket should
 
05:42:37.120 --> 05:42:37.830 align:start position:0%
basis that's cash in your pocket should
you

05:42:37.830 --> 05:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh decide to leave the company at that
 
05:42:41.830 --> 05:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
point so the two yes
 
05:42:44.948 --> 05:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
if i'm owed two weeks for the year
 
05:42:47.670 --> 05:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i leave after six months i don't get
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
the full weeks full two weeks but this
 
05:42:50.240 --> 05:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
the full weeks full two weeks but this
bill

05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:42:53.110 --> 05:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
says i should get one week because
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's six months worth of my two weeks
 
05:42:57.120 --> 05:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
that's six months worth of my two weeks
and

05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
it clearly says that
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
through 24
 
05:43:05.910 --> 05:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
talk about those two special cases but
 
05:43:08.548 --> 05:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
outside of that paragraph in a different
 
05:43:12.150 --> 05:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
section there's lines 12 through 14
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
pay time off vacation vacation time earn
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
time i'm sorry i'm reading that out of
 
05:43:23.030 --> 05:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
order shall be considered compensation
 
05:43:25.910 --> 05:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore constitute wages do
 
05:43:28.548 --> 05:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
that's not contingent upon one of these
 
05:43:30.788 --> 05:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
other two
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
situations so
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
people have tried to correct the
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and say he misunderstood lines
 
05:43:40.310 --> 05:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
12-14 and then i heard it restated that
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
yes as a matter of fact that means just
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
what it looks like it means that once
 
05:43:47.670 --> 05:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
you receive accrued time
 
05:43:50.310 --> 05:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's as good as cash in the bank uh
 
05:43:53.430 --> 05:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
should you become separated
 
05:43:55.830 --> 05:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
so it bothers me that we're going into a
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:00.948 --> 05:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
saying the language that's before us
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
means two entirely different things it
 
05:44:03.840 --> 05:44:05.270 align:start position:0%
means two entirely different things it
obviously

05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:44:07.350 --> 05:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
is intended to mean one or the other and
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's obviously written one way or the
 
05:44:10.390 --> 05:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
other and
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
personally i agree with everything the
 
05:44:14.548 --> 05:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
chairman said about it
 
05:44:14.558 --> 05:44:16.628 align:start position:0%
chairman said about it
um

05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
i could be corrected if i'm entirely
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
mistaken though thank you
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative amandaville and then
 
05:44:23.680 --> 05:44:24.628 align:start position:0%
representative amandaville and then
cahill

05:44:24.628 --> 05:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
cahill
 
05:44:28.150 --> 05:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you mr chairman
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
just quickly to touch on the point um
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
just raised
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
um the way i read this uh this bill
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
is that uh in line 12 it says for
 
05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
purposes of this section
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
05:44:44.000 --> 05:44:45.350 align:start position:0%
the definition
of

05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
vacation time etc as wages do
 
05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
is applicable to the rest of the section
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
and that does relate to the specific
 
05:44:58.788 --> 05:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:01.270 --> 05:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you mentioned several people
 
05:45:01.280 --> 05:45:03.110 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you mentioned several people
having

05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:45:03.120 --> 05:45:04.708 align:start position:0%
having
described

05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
described
 
05:45:04.718 --> 05:45:06.150 align:start position:0%
described
intervening

05:45:06.150 --> 05:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
intervening
 
05:45:06.160 --> 05:45:07.590 align:start position:0%
intervening
between

05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:45:10.230 --> 05:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
an employer and employee is a as a as a
 
05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
bad idea and i might have been one of
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
them you were thinking of when we were
 
05:45:14.788 --> 05:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:45:16.240 --> 05:45:17.590 align:start position:0%
the um
non-competes

05:45:17.590 --> 05:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
non-competes
 
05:45:17.600 --> 05:45:18.390 align:start position:0%
non-competes
and

05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh that in the question of a non-compete
 
05:45:22.390 --> 05:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
specifically typically specifically
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
negotiated deal between sophisticated
 
05:45:27.120 --> 05:45:28.150 align:start position:0%
negotiated deal between sophisticated
parties

05:45:28.150 --> 05:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
parties
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about something
 
05:45:33.270 --> 05:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's usually a
 
05:45:35.430 --> 05:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
non-negotiated a standard practice and
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's the question of what is
 
05:45:39.670 --> 05:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
understood between the parties it's true
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
this just relates to two specific areas
 
05:45:43.830 --> 05:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
but my concern
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that it relates to an area where
 
05:45:47.040 --> 05:45:48.390 align:start position:0%
is that it relates to an area where
and

05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:50.708 --> 05:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
an employee really doesn't
 
05:45:50.718 --> 05:45:52.310 align:start position:0%
an employee really doesn't
understand

05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
the the loss
 
05:45:57.030 --> 05:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
that he or she will sustain
 
05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
if and when one of these two things
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
happens it's it's not a negotiated
 
05:46:04.708 --> 05:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
fourth thing it's an unperceived thing
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
and that's the
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
in inequity that this bill seeks to
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.150 --> 05:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh what he said
 
05:46:21.670 --> 05:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
and and i will add that uh
 
05:46:24.390 --> 05:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know i i recently studied 54 percent
 
05:46:24.400 --> 05:46:25.110 align:start position:0%
you know i i recently studied 54 percent
of

05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:46:28.548 --> 05:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
workers leave behind vacation time and
 
05:46:29.910 --> 05:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's either they don't use what they're
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
allotted and they continue employed or
 
05:46:33.030 --> 05:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
they they leave
 
05:46:34.390 --> 05:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
even though they're encouraged to use
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
the time because it's it's good for them
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's good for the company to be
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
refreshed and everything
 
05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
but again uh this does apply to only two
 
05:46:44.310 --> 05:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
these two situations where
 
05:46:46.470 --> 05:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's i believe they're unanticipated you
 
05:46:48.310 --> 05:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
know the the employer may have an idea
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
that he's going to sell the company
 
05:46:51.910 --> 05:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know in a year or two but he
 
05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't tell the employee that
 
05:46:55.030 --> 05:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
when they walk in
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
the employee would would not peruse the
 
05:47:00.470 --> 05:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh the entire handbook basically you're
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
listening to what's the pay what's the
 
05:47:02.638 --> 05:47:03.590 align:start position:0%
listening to what's the pay what's the
hours

05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh how much of the health insurance do i
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
have to cover you're not asking about
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
what happens it's not an anti-nuptial
 
05:47:08.958 --> 05:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
what happens it's not an anti-nuptial
agreement

05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we're considering and i know that's
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
very it's not very romantic if you were
 
05:47:15.670 --> 05:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
saying what what happens when we break
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
up you know do i get to keep this and
 
05:47:18.788 --> 05:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
you get to keep that
 
05:47:22.390 --> 05:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
so it is again very very limited
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:47:26.470 --> 05:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
you all you have claim to is what you've
 
05:47:26.480 --> 05:47:27.430 align:start position:0%
you all you have claim to is what you've
earned

05:47:27.430 --> 05:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
earned
 
05:47:29.190 --> 05:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i know that's an old
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
philosophical difference about whether
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
you earned it or it was a gift
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
but it's pretty clear that people earn
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
their vacation time and that it should
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
belong to them
 
05:47:41.910 --> 05:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
at least under these circumstances when
 
05:47:43.030 --> 05:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
they leave
 
05:47:48.150 --> 05:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:50.548 --> 05:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
senator fellas
 
05:47:52.788 --> 05:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
um if you had asked me before today if
 
05:47:57.030 --> 05:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
things like this ever happened that
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
people um
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
were laid off or
 
05:48:04.230 --> 05:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
whatever and they thought that they had
 
05:48:06.788 --> 05:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
vacation days accumulated that they were
 
05:48:08.788 --> 05:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
going to get paid for and they weren't i
 
05:48:11.110 --> 05:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
would i would have been astonished
 
05:48:12.070 --> 05:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:48:13.670 --> 05:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:48:15.750 --> 05:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
that that just goes on just
 
05:48:19.430 --> 05:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
floors me so i to me this bill just
 
05:48:22.868 --> 05:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
looks like a truth in hiring bill
 
05:48:25.750 --> 05:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
so when somebody's hired
 
05:48:28.470 --> 05:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
this bill requires that the employer
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
write down exactly the conditions that
 
05:48:33.350 --> 05:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
he wants to have
 
05:48:36.070 --> 05:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
related to accumulated vacation in six
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
days and just spell it all out it
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't require them to do anything
 
05:48:43.750 --> 05:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
specific it doesn't require them to give
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
a certain number of days it doesn't
 
05:48:45.840 --> 05:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
a certain number of days it doesn't
require

05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:48:47.280 --> 05:48:48.310 align:start position:0%
require
a

05:48:48.310 --> 05:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
maximum number of accrued days they can
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
write whatever policy they want they
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
just need to write it down
 
05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
and give it to the employee
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
so that they know what they're in for
 
05:49:03.270 --> 05:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
so in terms of your example
 
05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
you hire somebody and you tell them they
 
05:49:05.760 --> 05:49:06.948 align:start position:0%
you hire somebody and you tell them they
have

05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
have

05:49:10.470 --> 05:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
it should be spelled out if they earn
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
that right from the beginning and can
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
take it all in the beginning or if they
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to wait
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
a month and and take you know just part
 
05:49:24.788 --> 05:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
of it if they accrue a day a week or a
 
05:49:27.430 --> 05:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
one day a month vacation it just needs
 
05:49:30.150 --> 05:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
to be spelled out it doesn't prevent
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
them from doing anything
 
05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
they just need to spell it out so the
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
employee knows what they're getting into
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion from someone who has
 
05:49:42.390 --> 05:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
no experience with your committee
 
05:49:45.590 --> 05:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:47.990 --> 05:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate you at least taking the
 
05:49:50.070 --> 05:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
time to read it and make some comments
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cahill

05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 14 are of particular
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
interest to business owners
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
we're redefining what earned time
 
05:50:15.440 --> 05:50:16.390 align:start position:0%
we're redefining what earned time
vacation

05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
05:50:19.110 --> 05:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
vacation time and pay time off will be
 
05:50:21.110 --> 05:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
considered compensation and therefore
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
therefore constitute wages due
 
05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
while it looks
 
05:50:28.830 --> 05:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
simple on the front
 
05:50:33.510 --> 05:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
it section 44 of 275 payment of wages
 
05:50:35.628 --> 05:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
the first sentence under
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
275.44 whenever an employer discharges
 
05:50:40.310 --> 05:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
an employee the employer shall pay the
 
05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
employee employees wages in full within
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
72 hours
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
if we're taking earned time vacation
 
05:50:48.708 --> 05:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
time paid time off
 
05:50:53.430 --> 05:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:53.440 --> 05:50:54.390 align:start position:0%
 
where

05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
where is the
 
05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
benefit to the employer if we're taking
 
05:51:00.868 --> 05:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
away the sick time as well for being
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
considered as wages due maybe they have
 
05:51:05.910 --> 05:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
a vacation time use it or lose a policy
 
05:51:08.470 --> 05:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
but they get to bank their sick time and
 
05:51:10.868 --> 05:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
if they're separated
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
their wages do becomes
 
05:51:15.110 --> 05:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
null and void if they have a sick bank
 
05:51:16.628 --> 05:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we're
 
05:51:18.788 --> 05:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
talking about the same thing when they
 
05:51:23.910 --> 05:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:27.590 --> 05:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
does that make sense mr chairman
 
05:51:31.670 --> 05:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:34.310 --> 05:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
one last comment from representative
 
05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh to uh
 
05:51:38.830 --> 05:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni
 
05:51:38.840 --> 05:51:40.390 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni
the

05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
sick days are not considered
 
05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
wasters do they they shall not be
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
considered wagers do
 
05:51:49.350 --> 05:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
so you would only pay and again only
 
05:51:51.430 --> 05:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances if you
 
05:51:52.948 --> 05:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately decided to leave the
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
restaurant business and sold your
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
business and did not transfer the hours
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
that your employees had earned
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
you would be required to pay them but
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
not for the sick days
 
05:52:06.390 --> 05:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
if you have if you use pto
 
05:52:07.990 --> 05:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
instead of separating them into
 
05:52:09.670 --> 05:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
different banks
 
05:52:12.628 --> 05:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
then then i guess in that situation you
 
05:52:12.638 --> 05:52:14.150 align:start position:0%
then then i guess in that situation you
would

05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:52:15.590 --> 05:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
but that's a decision that you could
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
take it you know prior to that time
 
05:52:18.160 --> 05:52:19.110 align:start position:0%
take it you know prior to that time
um

05:52:19.110 --> 05:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
i wanted to correct the uh record for
 
05:52:24.868 --> 05:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
our colleagues sitting in today because
 
05:52:26.548 --> 05:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
the bill does not just require you to
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
spell it out
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
although there were some good business
 
05:52:31.030 --> 05:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
practices up in the
 
05:52:33.750 --> 05:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
first section it also requires that
 
05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances a layoff or
 
05:52:38.230 --> 05:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
transfer or sale of the business
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
then you would pay
 
05:52:39.760 --> 05:52:40.548 align:start position:0%
then you would pay
the

05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:52:42.628 --> 05:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
time that the employee has earned on
 
05:52:44.868 --> 05:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
their pay stub that's the main focus of
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:52:48.310 --> 05:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:52:48.320 --> 05:52:53.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair

every big company i've ever worked for
 
05:53:00.480 --> 05:53:01.510 align:start position:0%
every big company i've ever worked for
before

05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
has a spreadsheet and on the spreadsheet
 
05:53:06.150 --> 05:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
they put down what you've earned it is
 
05:53:09.110 --> 05:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
part of what they manage all their books
 
05:53:11.350 --> 05:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
they just make sure
 
05:53:11.360 --> 05:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
they just make sure
if

05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
if section one here is followed your
 
05:53:18.070 --> 05:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
vacation time your paid time off your
 
05:53:20.548 --> 05:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
earned time off would be on that
 
05:53:22.708 --> 05:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that is part of their
 
05:53:24.788 --> 05:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility to maintain their
 
05:53:24.798 --> 05:53:26.548 align:start position:0%
responsibility to maintain their
business

05:53:26.548 --> 05:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
i think this is a great idea especially
 
05:53:30.470 --> 05:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
a section section number one where
 
05:53:31.910 --> 05:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're asking businesses just to be
 
05:53:31.920 --> 05:53:33.110 align:start position:0%
you're asking businesses just to be
clear

05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:53:34.868 --> 05:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't cause any extra trouble
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're not asking anything of a business
 
05:53:38.708 --> 05:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't normally do but
 
05:53:40.548 --> 05:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
there are some that don't and it would
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
be very very nice to be able to set this
 
05:53:44.708 --> 05:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh into law
 
05:53:49.270 --> 05:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
