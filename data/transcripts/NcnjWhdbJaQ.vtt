00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
sustainable Fisheries
 
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
it also has
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
an integral part of national standards
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
that will be inclusive of the industry
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
and still maintaining conservation needs
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
based again based on science
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
so we have a New England fisheries
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
management Council
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
Mid-Atlantic fisheries management
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
Council and a South Atlantic fisheries
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
management Council that covers federal
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
waters which are Waters Beyond three
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
miles out to 200. statewaters is zero to
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
three miles
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
and it's the council's uh and and I'm
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
just saying those three councils cover
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic coast
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh we also have a governing body with
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:13.459 align:start position:0%
commission that deals with Fisheries
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
within those state water boundaries zero
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
to three miles
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
so what guides New Hampshire is these
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
two organizations governing
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
organizations the New England fisheries
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
management Council and the Atlantic
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
states marine fisheries commission that
 
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.290 align:start position:0%
states marine fisheries commission that
have

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
divide it up so so to speak depending on
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
the life cycles of these Fisheries fish
 
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:44.300 align:start position:0%
and Fisheries
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
create fisheries management plans
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
and each year or each three or five
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
years these fishery management plans are
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
updated with science through stock
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
assessments and such
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
when there comes time where
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
decisions need to be made to adjust
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
these fisheries management plans is when
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
these organizations asmfc and New
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
England fisheries management Council get
 
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.170 align:start position:0%
England fisheries management Council get
together

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:23.339 align:start position:0%
and vote as a body so Atlantic states
 
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
marine fisheries commission is comprised
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
of of the voting body from Maine down
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
through Florida
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
the New England fisheries management
 
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.410 align:start position:0%
the New England fisheries management
Council

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:35.420 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.949 align:start position:0%
Council
governs

00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
governs
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
from Connecticut up through Maine
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and again their their boundaries are
 
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
three miles to 200 or zero to three
 
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.189 align:start position:0%
three miles to 200 or zero to three
miles

00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
miles
 
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:50.300 align:start position:0%
once we
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
make decisions based on
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
stock assessments and updating these
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
fishery management plans is when we come
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
back to our state waters or our state
 
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.889 align:start position:0%
back to our state waters or our state
body

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:05.899 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.790 align:start position:0%
body
and

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.829 align:start position:0%
and
present

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
rules or regulations to be voted through
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
to continue to maintain these
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable Fisheries
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
so sometimes on an annual basis I will
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
come before this body
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
how to move forward with some rules and
 
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
how to move forward with some rules and
regulations

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
as well as we listened to this body
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
um if they have thoughts on how they
 
00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:39.139 align:start position:0%
would like to see additional
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
conservation measures or additional
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
measures to maintain sustainable
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
Fisheries within our statewaters
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of a quick recap
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
is there any questions I would like to
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
ask if you could go into explaining the
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
species that we have here as our our
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
common species because I'm sure that it
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
differs from what they're doing in
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
Indonesia and they might be interested
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
to know what where our Fisheries are
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
actually bringing in
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
um and and what our major species are
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
and our subspecies and even some of the
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
things we're doing with aquaculture such
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
you better just go
 
00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.289 align:start position:0%
you better just go
um

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
so our in New Hampshire our primary uh
 
00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
economically viable fishery is the
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
American lobster Fishery
 
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:39.610 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
that is
[Music]

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
that is what what is coming in with our
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
largest Landings in our largest
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
economic viability to our coastline
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
we also again these Fisheries are
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
prosecuted not just within state waters
 
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:00.419 align:start position:0%
but also within federal waters that they
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
are allowed to come in and land from
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
federal waters
 
00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:08.179 align:start position:0%
we also have ground fish Fisheries
 
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:10.940 align:start position:0%
our ground fish complex
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
consists of cod Pollock cake those sort
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
species that are mid-water dwelling
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
species we also have flounders we have
 
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:27.380 align:start position:0%
your typical
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
saltwater species that are found along
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic coast and that migrate
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
as a chairman splain indicated we also
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
have our species within state waters
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
that really don't move around much like
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
oysters and clams and such
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
so for
 
00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:51.730 align:start position:0%
so for
um

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:51.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
are are more sedentary species that
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
aren't migratory
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have found that it's difficult to be
 
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:02.660 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
sustain viable Fisheries because there's
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
such a huge population
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
of people that
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
um certainly are drawn to harvest these
 
00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.289 align:start position:0%
um certainly are drawn to harvest these
species

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of times with
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
um in these conditions we just allow
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
residents to be able to harvest under
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
certain conditions and such so that we
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
however due to climate change and due to
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
just interests in general of harvesting
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
there has been encouragement for
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
agriculture to occur
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire currently our
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
primary agriculture species
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
are oysters
 
00:19:56.409 --> 00:19:56.419 align:start position:0%
we also have muscles
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
muscle lines we have kelp lines
 
00:20:05.169 --> 00:20:05.179 align:start position:0%
we have a small research also
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
agriculture communities that are
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
researching how to
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
raise trout or sea run trout or salmon
 
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
or these sort of species also but our
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
major Focus for agriculture in
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
statewaters is the oyster
 
00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:27.710 align:start position:0%
statewaters is the oyster
species

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:32.330 align:start position:0%
 
great

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
um does anyone here want to add on to
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
anything as far as concerns and or
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
Sportsman situations maybe even touch on
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
the bill that we did have this year on
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
I just have one quick statement and
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
a very Diversified organization they'll
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
have a section of Fish and Game who was
 
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
really focused on law enforcement but
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
they also have a section that is
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
biologists that are really taking care
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
of the species and the animals in the
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
area so they they have uh wear varied
 
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.690 align:start position:0%
area so they they have uh wear varied
hats

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
hats
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
right and is there interest in the
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
freshwater stuff that we do as well or
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
are we focusing mainly on marine species
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
fresh water as well so
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
I could toss this back to Cherie again
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about our fresh water program
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
and we do we do raise uh fish that we
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
then release in and that keeps the
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
Sportsman able to go we don't have any
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
fresh water industry that I know of uh
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
but we have the Sportsman is that
 
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
but we have the Sportsman is that
correct

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh yeah for the most part that's correct
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
we have small bait Fisheries that are
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
that can be on a commercial basis but
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
for the most part our Inland Fisheries
 
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.190 align:start position:0%
for the most part our Inland Fisheries
uh

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
revolve around
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
cold water species and warm water
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
species so you have your cold water
 
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.020 align:start position:0%
species which are primarily your trout
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
we have brook trout brown trout rainbow
 
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.549 align:start position:0%
we have brook trout brown trout rainbow
trout

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
trout
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
and a warm water species such as your
 
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
bass your various bass your perch and
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
such so again we're a small state and
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
yet have a population that's very
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
interested in recreating for these
 
00:22:29.159 --> 00:22:30.549 align:start position:0%
interested in recreating for these
species

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I've got this number
 
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.149 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I've got this number
correct

00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I know we used to have seven
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
hatcheries I'm not sure we still have
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
some I thought there were five right now
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
um that raise uh the various uh trout
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned as well as a
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
landlocked Atlantic salmon
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
so these are
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
um for the trout is primarily a put and
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
take fishery we raise them up to be a
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
harvestable size or an exciting size for
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
recreational Harvesters to angle for
 
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.649 align:start position:0%
recreational Harvesters to angle for
and

00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:16.669 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
we do we do release uh fingerlings you
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
know your small species in some of our
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
our higher elevation ponds and such to
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
give that excitement also for
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
recreational Anglers to be able to
 
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:37.700 align:start position:0%
harvest if they decide to hike in
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
distances to do that sort of fishing
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
we do not have any hatcheries for our
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
warm water species we just make sure
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
that we have rules or regulations in
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
place that will reduce the amount of
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
harvest per person to make sure that
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
these species are maintained sustainably
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
can you just go over briefly because I
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
think it's important an important issue
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
as well when we talk about conservation
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
and how we conserve our Fisheries uh
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
striped bass I know there was just an
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
area that was closed recently due to uh
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
a die off of
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
fish being killed after being released I
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
just want to talk about how we manage
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
that species
 
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
so our striped bass species are
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
migratory species and they are managed
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
through the Atlantic states marine
 
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:40.340 align:start position:0%
fisheries Commission
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
they right now are in a period of
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
um oh being overfished over
 
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
and overfishing was occurring
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
so the minute those categories popped up
 
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:00.620 align:start position:0%
in front of us at the asmfc level
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
that put us into creating a 10-year
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
we're not recovering very well so what
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
has happened is probably due to climate
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
change we don't have good recruitment
 
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.810 align:start position:0%
change we don't have good recruitment
occurring

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
and warmer waters are definitely
 
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.909 align:start position:0%
and warmer waters are definitely
affecting

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:27.490 align:start position:0%
affecting
um

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:27.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
how the fish react to being under stress
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
so if they're being harvested alive
 
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:34.940 align:start position:0%
they're being angled
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
fished on a lot Catch and Release sort
 
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:41.900 align:start position:0%
of scenario in warm Waters
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
then they will start dying
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
so the state of Maine just recently
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
closed the Saco River
 
00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
due to this sort of event we had a
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
striped bass that were or Maine had
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
striped bass that were in their rivers
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
that were being heavily fished a lot of
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
Catch and Release the waters were
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
warming up and then they were noticing
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
at a at a higher quantity than what we
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
want to see
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
during a period of time that we're
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
trying to recover this this particular
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
I I don't know uh how it works for you
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
folks so
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that there's always a question here
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
about sustainability as driven by our
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
federal government versus the rights of
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
fishermen and earning their livelihoods
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I I don't know if Sharia
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch base on that certainly
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
controlling how fishermen operate leads
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
into the sustainability of this history
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
but it also always has some impact on
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
those people's uh livelihood so
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
I I'd be interested to know how it works
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question so we
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
have the same facing we are facing the
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
same problem you know in Indonesia as
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
well so uh the uh business and the
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
scientist needs is uh
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
something like the opposite direction
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
you know the person may want more face
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
but the same the scientists oh no you
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
cannot catch more fish but you have to
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
preset the resource so sometimes we have
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
yeah option between there then we take
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
what we call it's not like there will be
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
a solution but uh we have to choose the
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
best option for that to preserve the
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
resource even uh it's her the pressure
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
man maybe you know I know maybe in here
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's it happened as well and then when
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
we take uh we create the policy or
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
regulation to manage our business but
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it will not be it will not good
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the businessman sometimes
 
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.690 align:start position:0%
for the businessman sometimes
yeah

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'll go again if you want absolutely uh
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
on the handout here it talks about uh it
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
says to broaden understanding with a
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
wider range of advocacy tools and
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms Etc
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
so Chief Patterson can speak to this
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
much better than I can but
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
there are a number of efforts in the
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and Maine where
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
volunteer groups come together
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
and and Advocate they'll come here to
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
testify to this committee to advocate
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
for a position and I think it's a really
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
important part of of how this works in
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as the the chairman
 
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned a short time ago
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
this past year this past three years
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:17.059 align:start position:0%
there was a a bill proposed to allow
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
scuba divers
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
to harvest Lobsters by hand from the
 
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.930 align:start position:0%
to harvest Lobsters by hand from the
bottom

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
and it was very controversial there was
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion about the the
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the lobster fishery
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
and would it impact that and it it came
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
down to quite a conversation in here so
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
but Chief Patterson might be able to
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
better talk about sort of those advocacy
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
kind of programs and the volunteer
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
efforts that happen but it's a it's a
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
really big part of I think how how New
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire operates a fish and game
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'll put a plug in for there
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
unfortunately generally underfunded I
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if the same thing happens on
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll follow up on that with
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
um more information about this bill that
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
we had that we dealt with uh
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
mostly we still have some cleanup to do
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
on it but it should be going into effect
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
after the Senate took a stab at doing
 
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
some changes to it one of the things
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
that came out of this whole discussion
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
on allowing divers to go down for
 
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
lobsters was that the divers were seeing
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we call ghost traps these
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
are fishing traps that have become
 
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
separated from their line and are now at
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
the whims of the ocean
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
getting tangled up in balls but they
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
still continue to catch animals that
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
crawl into them that then die and become
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
bait to attract more animals and so it's
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
difficult to work again work for your
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
sustainability if you've got
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
fishing traps that are fishing without
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
anybody being in charge of them
 
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
anybody being in charge of them
underwater

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
underwater
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
so we needed to come up with a way to
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
identify their locations and clean them
 
00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:00.419 align:start position:0%
up and we're a little late coming to the
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
game compared to a state like Maine
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
Maine just to our North has a lot more
 
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
Lobster fishermen and they have a much
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
bigger problem with the traps that have
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
become separated and so they started a
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
cleanup program
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
that was done by a volunteer
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
organization working in conjunction with
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
the lobstermen just in the Boothbay
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
Harbor area alone where they were able
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
to pull out and remove thousands of
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
traps that had been
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
found washed up in areas where they were
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
underwater wrapped in balls and um
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
most of them were recycled but some of
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
them were still in condition where they
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
could be returned to their owners and
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
and refurbished and put back in the
 
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.769 align:start position:0%
and refurbished and put back in the
water

00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
um but that cleanup is one of the things
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
that we now have an active Bill uh with
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
potentially some money allocated to help
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the cleanup of that and push
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
ourselves towards trying to remove these
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
underwater uh ghost traps so that they
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
aren't continually catching species and
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
we have photos that it's not just the
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
lobsters that crawl into these lobster
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
traps we have pictures of some cod that
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
were inside and trapped and can't get
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
out and
 
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:12.860 align:start position:0%
um all kinds of things
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
so that's another aspect where we're
 
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
working on on uh trying to
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
trying to be working hand in hand with
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
the lobstermen we've got a little bit of
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
a harder time convincing them that it's
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
a problem they need to deal with then
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
Maine did Maine they were all right on
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
board jumped on onto it and
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
when he says this was controversial
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
arguing between the lobstermen and the
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
divers and the environmental groups
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
about how big is this problem really
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
um of course at first the lobsterman
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
didn't want to say the problem even
 
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.649 align:start position:0%
didn't want to say the problem even
existed

00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
existed
 
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to us
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
um but we've got the issue currently
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
being solved in Massachusetts and Maine
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
how could we be different right
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
um and when we had pictures brought up
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
from the ocean bottom that showed them
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
we know there's a problem how extensive
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
that problem is we still don't know we
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
need a study to see how many traps are
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
down there where they're located and and
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
how big of a problem it is but we've got
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
a step forward now with this bill where
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
we're going to allocate some funding and
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
try to start to recognize the problem
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
and address it
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
um and then I guess I'll toss back to
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
Cherie now so she can add more context
 
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I love this hot
 
00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.970 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I love this hot
topics

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
topics
 
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.409 align:start position:0%
topics
um

00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:37.909 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
as many countries and ours included
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
ghost gear has been a severe problem not
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
just with in this case lobster traps but
 
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:52.940 align:start position:0%
also Nets
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
we don't see too much of that in our
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
statewaters with Nets because we have a
 
00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:00.830 align:start position:0%
statewaters with Nets because we have a
pretty

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.669 align:start position:0%
pretty
um

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
tightly regulated
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
way of being able to fish or you can't
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
fish using Nets
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it's you have to be
 
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099 align:start position:0%
actively fishing a net you have to be on
 
00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:15.230 align:start position:0%
actively fishing a net you have to be on
site

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
we don't allow most mobile gear in our
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
statewaters so yes our probably our
 
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
primary ghost gear issue is the lobster
 
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.149 align:start position:0%
primary ghost gear issue is the lobster
gear

00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
gear
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
we've decided to come at it many years
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
ago from a mini-pronged approach which
 
00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.589 align:start position:0%
ago from a mini-pronged approach which
unfortunately

00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
has not been inclusive of in-water gear
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
so our many prong approach started out
 
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.250 align:start position:0%
so our many prong approach started out
with

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
doing Beach cleanup so the lobster
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
fishing industry for over 20 years has
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
been with the help of Fish and Game
 
00:34:57.359 --> 00:35:00.650 align:start position:0%
been with the help of Fish and Game
organizing

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
Beach cleanup time frame so usually
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
after a winter we have
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
storms and such you see a lot of gear
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
that will come up onto the coast and
 
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:13.820 align:start position:0%
that is cleaned up before the
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh the summer residents start to show up
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
and then we entered into an MOA with
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
another state agency who is responsible
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
for state parks and such
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that they are also allowed to now
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
pick up uh gear that are on the beach or
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
in shallow water that they may find that
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
would be interrupting people recreating
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
at state parks and such
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that for lobster gear we
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
have a regulation that indicates that
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
essentially only a member of law
 
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.410 align:start position:0%
essentially only a member of law
enforcement

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.230 align:start position:0%
enforcement
or

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game designee person
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
or a lobster Harvester themselves
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
can only pick up gear
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's considered private property here
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's pretty constrained as
 
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
to who can actually pick up
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
gear that appears to be ghost gear or
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
dare lickier
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
the next manner of approaching this was
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
being able to provide a way of disposing
 
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:31.820 align:start position:0%
of gear
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
for the various fishing industries
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
we were informed that many Town
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
municipality uh disposal or dumps were
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
not were no longer taking
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
fishing gear
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
and this then kind of promoted
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
a out of sight out of mind thought from
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
the fishing industry that if they just
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
go dump it out in the water you don't
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
you don't see it again
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
so what we did is we created these what
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
we call fishing for energy bins and
 
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
we call fishing for energy bins and
opportunities

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
such that any uh
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
person in the fishing industry
 
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.910 align:start position:0%
person in the fishing industry
can

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
dump particular things into this fishing
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
for energy bin
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
and where it it goes is a company called
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
covanta in Massachusetts that will burn
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:42.859 align:start position:0%
gear types or it'll go to
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
snitch or Steel in other words your
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
lobster traps and such which are metal
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
for recycling
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
so it's a complete recycling program at
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
this point in time that the fishing
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
industry has been utilizing to its
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
fullest extent they do bring in gear
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
that they will no longer be using and it
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't end up in places that it
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
shouldn't end up in if it's no longer
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
viable gear
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
we also
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
um in in our travels of
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
picking up gear off the coast and such
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
if the if it is viable gear we will
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
contact the individuals there they all
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
have to have some sort of identification
 
00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:32.099 align:start position:0%
on their gear
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
we notify them and we give them the
 
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity of two weeks to come and
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
pick it up if they don't pick it up then
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
it goes into the recycling bin and it's
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:49.820 align:start position:0%
and so now with this year's help with
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
the legislative process and this
 
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.130 align:start position:0%
the legislative process and this
committee

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.290 align:start position:0%
committee
we

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
obtain some funds to be able to now work
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
with gear that is in the water as you
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
can imagine it's very hard to locate
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
gear that's in water if it's in shallow
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
water that's a little bit easier but you
 
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:13.220 align:start position:0%
know we have
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
it would be harder to be able to detect
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
where gear derelict gear is and such
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
without technology such as side scan
 
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.150 align:start position:0%
without technology such as side scan
sonar

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
sonar
 
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.050 align:start position:0%
sonar
um

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
as just an example to be able to find
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
where this gear is
 
00:39:36.849 --> 00:39:36.859 align:start position:0%
we have encouraged
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
communities that such as the diving
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
community and such to give us a call if
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
they find a ball of gear so that we can
 
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:48.740 align:start position:0%
find it
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
and recover it
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
as a fish and game agency or we have
 
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.550 align:start position:0%
as a fish and game agency or we have
actually

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
had Coast Guard help us a couple times
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
with some big balls and they had a big
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
bigger ship than ours to be able to
 
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.490 align:start position:0%
bigger ship than ours to be able to
recover

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:06.500 align:start position:0%
recover
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
these gears and again we will do similar
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
to what we do with all recovered gear if
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's a viable gear we'll
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
contact the owner if not then it goes to
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
the recycling bin and such
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are with this many
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
pronged approach to try and deal with
 
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:27.890 align:start position:0%
pronged approach to try and deal with
um

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
and prevent derelict gear in ghost gear
 
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.069 align:start position:0%
and prevent derelict gear in ghost gear
thanks

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
and touching on that
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you could also
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
explain the um the depths of water that
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
we have off of our Coastline because I
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
know it does drop off precipitously and
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
quickly past the Isle of Shoals but
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
we've got lots of shallow area between
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
here and there and where Indonesia is a
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
mostly island country they probably have
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of familiarity with the way that
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
we have a relationship with the Isle of
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
Shoals and things get fished in between
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
but then we've got the deep water as
 
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.109 align:start position:0%
but then we've got the deep water as
well

00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm not familiar enough with how our
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
depths vary
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire's coastline is
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
um is complex habitat it has got a
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
variety of Rocky
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
um areas got rocky Shoreline we have
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
beaches we have Sandy areas we have
 
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
muddy areas when I had described earlier
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
about statewaters being between zero and
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
three miles that also encompasses if
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
you're going around Islands
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
so we have a series of islands off of
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
our Coast called the Isles of Shoals
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty much split in half
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
between New Hampshire and the state of
 
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.609 align:start position:0%
between New Hampshire and the state of
Maine

00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
but you also when you talk about state
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
waters you're also talking about those
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
three miles around
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.089 align:start position:0%
we do have
um

00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:07.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
varying depths you know of course from
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
the shoreline we have depths out by the
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
shoals that are at 60 feet then we also
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
can drop down to 200 feet in various
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
areas both between our Shoreline and the
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
shoals as well as beyond the shoals so
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
it it becomes a little bit
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
tenuous as to how you can identify where
 
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:32.900 align:start position:0%
where gear might be and how
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
varied the the recovery of gear will
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
have to be considered when we are able
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
great anybody else uh Carol
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
I see that on Wednesday thank you Mr
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
chair I see that on Wednesday you're
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
going to the Nashua National Fish
 
00:42:55.859 --> 00:42:57.770 align:start position:0%
going to the Nashua National Fish
Hatchery

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
Hatchery
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
you can re you can help me because my my
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
knowledge is old
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
have they abandoned
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
the salmon program
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
so for years I how many years and how
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
much money was spent in the attempt to
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
bring migratory salmon back into the
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
rivers of New Hampshire and I think the
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
federal government was the main driver
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
of that but they used to do that from
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
that Hatchery but I didn't know if you
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
could address if that's as a failed
 
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.130 align:start position:0%
could address if that's as a failed
program

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:31.700 align:start position:0%
very good question
 
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.210 align:start position:0%
very good question
[Music]

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.589 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:43:35.819 --> 00:43:36.530 align:start position:0%
so the
the

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and state agencies that try and work
 
00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:42.619 align:start position:0%
in concert to
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
restore Fisheries or provide other
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
sustainable ways of harvesting Fisheries
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
for example our hatcheries with trout
 
00:43:59.930 --> 00:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
so decades ago
 
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
clear understanding that the Atlantic
 
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.190 align:start position:0%
clear understanding that the Atlantic
salmon

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
salmon
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
so you have landlock Atlantic salmon
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
literally those are landlocked in our
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
lakes and such and you have the
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
migratory Atlantic salmon
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
in our major Coastal Rivers between
 
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Maine it was determined
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
that these anatomous species that um
 
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
live most of their lives in salt water
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
but come into fresh water to spawn and
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
they spend
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
for Atlantic salmon they'll spend two
 
00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:44.339 align:start position:0%
years in fresh water before they migrate
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
back out to the ocean
 
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.849 align:start position:0%
back out to the ocean
so

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
we weren't seeing the returns coming
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
back to our freshwater reaches of their
 
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.130 align:start position:0%
back to our freshwater reaches of their
habitat

00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
habitat
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
of course these freshwater reaches have
 
00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:02.109 align:start position:0%
of course these freshwater reaches have
been

00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
severely truncated by dams
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
and most of these dams up until the 60s
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
and 70s had no fish passage on them and
 
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
even now there's very little fish
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
passage on most of the dams that are
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
within the Atlantic Salmons
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
reach or within their
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
their cycle their migratory cycle
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
so Connecticut
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
was the first to really detect an issue
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
with a declining Atlantic salmon
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
population in their river systems of
 
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.630 align:start position:0%
population in their river systems of
course

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
um as you can imagine climate change has
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
been occurring for decades it is
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
something that just occurs recently it's
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
occurring over decades and you have some
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
key species
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
that might be the canary in the mind
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
they might be the detectors that there
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
are changes that are occurring and in
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
Connecticut it was determined that there
 
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.290 align:start position:0%
Connecticut it was determined that there
was

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.089 align:start position:0%
was
um

00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
that was the southernmost reach at the
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
time of the Atlantic salmon the Atlantic
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
salmon again go from on the Atlantic
 
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
salmon again go from on the Atlantic
coast

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
coast
 
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.530 align:start position:0%
coast
um

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
go from Connecticut or dead right up
 
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
so there was a federal push
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
to try and restore the Atlantic salmon
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
back into some of these rivers and it
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
started out in Massachusetts in
 
00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:39.770 align:start position:0%
started out in Massachusetts in
Connecticut

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.970 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
um

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
where they started putting in fish
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
passage systems and dams
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
and had hatcheries both in Vermont and
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
in we had a small one in New Hampshire
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
have a small one in New Hampshire the
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
Nashua uh National Fish Hatchery
 
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
where we were or the feds were
 
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.670 align:start position:0%
where we were or the feds were
raising

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
the juveniles and stocking them out into
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
the ocean
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
so that they were kind of skipping that
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
that in fresh water reach of their life
 
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.250 align:start position:0%
that in fresh water reach of their life
cycle

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
in order to try and be more viable
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
considering the freshwater
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
habitat was not very hospitable to them
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden you just kind
 
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:35.780 align:start position:0%
of started to see this creep going north
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
of the Atlantic salmon in Northern
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
rivers from the Connecticut River also
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
start experiencing this concern of
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
diminished populations of Atlantic
 
00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:49.790 align:start position:0%
diminished populations of Atlantic
salmon

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
salmon
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
so in the
 
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.710 align:start position:0%
so in the
90s

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
90s
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.790 align:start position:0%
90s
um

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
it was determined that the
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
Inland or the freshwater habitats were
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
going to continue not to be hospitable
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
for the Atlantic salmon population in
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
those particular River reaches
 
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:16.940 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
that had these hatcheries the U.S fish
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
and wildlife service
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
decided to change species raising
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
different species that would be more of
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
a viable fishery to be able to restore
 
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.099 align:start position:0%
so right now the Nashua Hatchery is
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
Raising American Chad
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
or the Connecticut and the Merrimack
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
rivers and when they have some extra
 
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:50.180 align:start position:0%
they get we get some of those extra
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
juveniles also to stock in our
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
freshwater reaches and American Shadow
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
or anadramus species also they'll go out
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
to the ocean and come around when they
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
come back when they decide they are
 
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
anything else from my committee members
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
uh chairman spielen if you don't mind
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
yep our visitors have a lot of questions
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
they would like to ask if you could give
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
them time absolutely we're uh where I
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
was going to go right over to them
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually if there was no other comments
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
from the from the side here
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
but I'll let Ben Ming do one question
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
and then we'll pop right over there
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
just very briefly to um your earlier
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
question of ocean depth maybe it might
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
be useful to talk about
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
um water temperatures because we have I
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't know two or three months of
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
hot weather but our ocean water tends to
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
be fairly cold
 
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
anybody who tries to swim around here
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
knows that
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
however it is getting warmer uh the Gulf
 
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
of Maine is actually one of the fastest
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
warming Waters
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
in the world today
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh there is a
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
a pinching so to speak of Colder Arctic
 
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.829 align:start position:0%
a pinching so to speak of Colder Arctic
Waters

00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
and our warmer gulp Waters that is
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
occurring and as a result of that we're
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
not getting the colder Waters coming
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
into the Gulf of Maine from the Arctic
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we uh used to so as a result we are
 
00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.190 align:start position:0%
that we uh used to so as a result we are
experiencing

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.809 align:start position:0%
experiencing
um

00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
a lot warmer
 
00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:37.089 align:start position:0%
a lot warmer
water

00:50:37.089 --> 00:50:37.099 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
which has effects of
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
all of the trophic levels of species so
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
you know right down to your benthic
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
species your copepods which feed our
 
00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:52.220 align:start position:0%
whales for example
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
or some species of our whales and shrimp
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
Northern shrimp we no longer have a
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
fishery for Northern shrimp because
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
again the the waters are too warm and
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
inhospitable to maintain
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
viable fishing opportunities for those
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
populations again these are some of
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
these species are canaries in the mine
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we're just going to be adapting to
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
these sort of conditions over the next
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
several decades or at least until the
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
okay let's turn it over to your first
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
questions I'll let you guys choose who
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair so we have a lot of
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
questions but I try to simplify the
 
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.849 align:start position:0%
questions but I try to simplify the
question

00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
so we want to know uh how do you
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
establish the policy the policy maybe a
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
step behind you creating the policy you
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
know managing the freezer is limited
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
resources and you have to distribute
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
fairly and equally among the Fisheries
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know so we want to now
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh how do you set the policy for the
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
some issues and then uh what is the role
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
of the representative in here to you
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
know to affect the policy
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
and then whether is it a political issue
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
for the to affect the uh decision or the
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
policy thank you
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
so as Sheree had mentioned there's um
 
00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
two governing bodies that that uh help
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
set the policy for the entire Atlantic
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast and then for our northern
 
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.390 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast and then for our northern
states

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.370 align:start position:0%
states
um

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:45.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
the federal government has a lot of uh
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
say over everything that has to happen
 
00:52:55.849 --> 00:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
along our whole Atlantic Coast at the
 
00:52:55.859 --> 00:52:56.450 align:start position:0%
along our whole Atlantic Coast at the
um

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
at the uh federal waters which was the
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
three miles and out and then for us the
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
zero to three miles in is uh more of
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
what we get to control as a state but we
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
also still have to fall on to the
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
guidance of that Atlantic states uh
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
fishing Council
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
um when an issue comes up that is
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
something that we need to address in our
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
state such as this derelict fishing gear
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
because it was being addressed in Maine
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
and in Massachusetts but we hadn't
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
really done anything regarding the gear
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
in water I want to make that clear we
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
had a successful program once it washes
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
up on shore but for everything that
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
remains hidden underwater
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a program but it became
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
an issue that we had to deal with with
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
our state itself
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
so that's when it comes to and our body
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
to make a legislative decision on trying
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
to find the best way to put forward a
 
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.370 align:start position:0%
to find the best way to put forward a
regulation

00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
that must be adhered to for our bodies
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
of water along the ocean
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
um anything that happens in the fresh
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
water is entirely done uh here by our
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
state and uh fish and game biologists
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
who advise us on the species population
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
and they make judgments uh with their
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
rules we have a process where not
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
everything has to come through the
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislature because that's a slow
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
process so we've given the fission game
 
00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:30.950 align:start position:0%
process so we've given the fission game
department

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
um the ability to make rules that set
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
seasonal limits and catching methods and
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
come down to the point where they can
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
actually close off bodies of water or
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
change the methods of fishing within
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
certain areas to best manage the Inland
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
side of things
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
anything to add to that Cherie
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
no that was a pretty good cursory view
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for the explanation so
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh when there is uh you know the
 
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
fisherman need that convey to your
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative in here
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh can you interfere the policy or
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
decision to change the
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
policy or regulation
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
we that's where the the activist groups
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
and uh such come into play
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
um if if the fishermen as an industry
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
have an issue that they
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
really feel needs to be addressed they
 
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
will together
 
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
um contact us and ask for legislation to
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
be put in
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
um that will typically start with a
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
draft piece of legislation from a
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
handful of state representatives keep in
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
mind we have
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
quite a lot at 400 state representatives
 
00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:00.260 align:start position:0%
we are actually the third largest
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
democratically elected body in the world
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so a handful of State reps would
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
draft some legislation and then it would
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
come to this committee
 
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.490 align:start position:0%
come to this committee
and

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
the fishermen would show up to testify
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
why do they wanted this bill what is the
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
purpose how's it going to affect them
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is because of something
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
they see that's coming out of the
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
federal regulations that might
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
caused them to lose their livelihood and
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
they want us to react to it as a state
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
and sometimes our hands are tied but
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's things we can do to
 
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
allow a balance between the needs of the
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
fishermen and the demands for
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
conservation from Washington or just in
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
general a rule from the Atlantic states
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
fisheries and that sort of thing
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
I want to know as a scientist uh I'm
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
interested in how you do the stock
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
assessment so this is the the the the
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
the basic of information that you need
 
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
to decide something for the regulation
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
so who that uh legitimate to do the
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
research is it the University or some
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
research agency and after that when they
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
process the data those information pass
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
so you can make regulation about it yeah
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question
 
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.630 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question
actually

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.230 align:start position:0%
actually
um

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
we have biologists in fish and game in
 
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
our department that work for them
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
full-time uh part of their job is to
 
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
survey the wildlife in the state that is
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh crucial towards towards uh Sportsmen
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
and or our Industries and then there's
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
also the Atlantic Fisheries Council that
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
I assume does some sort of uh some
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
surveying as well and we've got the
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
federal government always involved in
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
trying to do some stuff as well so it's
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
I think there's multiple groups that
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
come at this measurement and I'm going
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
to now turn it over to Cherie to explain
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
more closely how we get all of our data
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
you did you did
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
you did a chair
 
00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.309 align:start position:0%
you did a chair
um

00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
combination of oh I should say a
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
collaboration actually effort
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
um yes within States
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
each state there are various agencies
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for natural
 
00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:42.549 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for natural
resources

00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
or habitats right so
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
we are constantly out surveying or
 
00:58:55.569 --> 00:58:55.579 align:start position:0%
sampling populations and such
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
our sister agency the Department of
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental services will be out doing
 
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
what a quality uh work so we can
 
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.049 align:start position:0%
what a quality uh work so we can
collaborate

00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
collaborate
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
for data you know this is just part and
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
parcel of all the data that's collected
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
other states are doing the same
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
as well as as uh chairman splain
 
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
indicated the federal government is also
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
the the two organizations I mentioned
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic state supreme Fisheries
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
commission and the New England fisheries
 
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:32.540 align:start position:0%
management Council they also have staff
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for data collection
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
and analyzes
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we all have large responsibilities of
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring what our populations are
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
doing including the migratory species
 
00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:54.500 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why you have these
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
organizations and
 
00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.250 align:start position:0%
organizations and
um

00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
state agencies to be able to
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
recommend or to base decisions on
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
science and not something necessarily
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
that is based on subjectivity from an
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
industry or and such
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
what's really interesting and
 
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
fascinating actually is when we do go
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
through these processes the industry
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
does have input as we're going through
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
policy or or creating rules and
 
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.829 align:start position:0%
policy or or creating rules and
regulations

01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
so that we do hear that we do listen to
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
um if science doesn't necessarily back
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
up what the industry is observing on
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
their own then there are decisions that
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
have to be made through a policy
 
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
procedure to assure that
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
or try to ensure we're not putting
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
people out of business then we can reach
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
some sort of compromise where it's not
 
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:01.700 align:start position:0%
going to affect the sustainability
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
of their livelihoods as well as the
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
and do we get any of the data on fish
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
populations and species populations that
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're interested in out of the sportsmen
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
and fishermen themselves or is this
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
entirely driven by
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
our researchers and the researchers of
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
these organizations
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
oh it is yes it comes from everywhere
 
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.270 align:start position:0%
oh it is yes it comes from everywhere
actually

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:32.990 align:start position:0%
actually
um

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
part of the surveys are
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
can be done federally in collaborations
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
with States so we have a
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
a coastal survey that occurs
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
in Inland Fisheries
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
they primarily
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
determine population
 
01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.890 align:start position:0%
determine population
um

01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
and changes in population through their
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
their particular work of netting
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
um you know actually those sort of
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
methods of
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
long-term data sets and and the same
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
methodology to create those long-term
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
data sets where stable data sets can
 
01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:21.289 align:start position:0%
data sets where stable data sets can
create

01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
better data than
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
sporadic data sets
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
UNH are our University Systems are also
 
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
in part
 
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.770 align:start position:0%
in part
um

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
collecting data and providing not
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily towards stock assessments
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
and such but can provide
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions for us to be able to maybe
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
address if they're picking up something
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
that that state or federal agencies
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
aren't picking up but there are many
 
01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:56.780 align:start position:0%
surveys that are being conducted
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's there's all sorts of
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
methodologies of as you as you probably
 
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
methodologies of as you as you probably
are

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:06.980 align:start position:0%
utilizing in your countries too to
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
assure that the data sets and the data
 
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
that you're working with are going to be
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
reliable and defensible because the
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
industry relies on that and it's very
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
important that they have their input and
 
01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:23.579 align:start position:0%
that they have the confidence and the
 
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
data that you are
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
making decisions policy decisions on
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
and do we have any current
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
collaborations with unh
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh for any of this all the time
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
all the time yeah right now we're
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
collaborating with a rainbow smelt
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
project where UNH goes out and does work
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
for us in the spring
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
sorry just one quick statement
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
would you say it's a fair statement to
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
say that sometimes government can be
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
cumbersome but a fish and game and Des
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
have the authority and latitude if they
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
see some very
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh bad Trends happening they can't react
 
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
yes we can we certainly try and do that
 
01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:16.549 align:start position:0%
yes we can we certainly try and do that
absolutely

01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm curious about these uh stock
 
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
assessment you conduct in here what is
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
the boundary for the free stock
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
assessment here are you divided between
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
the state water and federal water or
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's just uh one stock for the first
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
for the stock
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
um it varies uh depending on the courses
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
the species but yes some of their uh
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
Coastal species or Atlantic Ocean
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
species are divided up into stocks
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely based on their area based on
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
um DNA you know their genetics and such
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
we can make those determinations that
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
when we do create policy
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
and fisheries management that we are
 
01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
relying on
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
maintaining stocks and not depleting one
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
not depleting another right we want to
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that you keep stock separate
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
when you make policy and management
 
01:05:20.819 --> 01:05:22.789 align:start position:0%
when you make policy and management
decisions

01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
so could you give me an example for the
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
stock that you conduct with the federal
 
01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
or with the uh commission something like
 
01:05:31.859 --> 01:05:32.809 align:start position:0%
or with the uh commission something like
that

01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:32.819 --> 01:05:40.730 align:start position:0%
that
species

01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
George's Bank
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
and then we have a gulf of Maine stock
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
so when we make
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
um fisheries management decisions
 
01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
and when we do the sampling and such we
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are sampling both
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
stocks appropriately and efficiently so
 
01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.150 align:start position:0%
stocks appropriately and efficiently so
that

01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
um we're managing both stocks
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
based on the data that's coming out of
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:23.930 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:32.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah uh

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:32.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.599 --> 01:07:08.809 align:start position:0%
 
support

01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
so that depends everything
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
to do with species right
 
01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:18.770 align:start position:0%
to do with species right
um

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
some species we've been successful very
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
successful with with implementing
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
regulations that then allow us to still
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
meet Market requirements for the
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
fishermen themselves and in some areas
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
we've made the fishermen unhappy and
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
I'll let Cherie talk about specific
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
examples but I think the Cod was one of
 
01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:38.829 align:start position:0%
examples but I think the Cod was one of
them

01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
where we had to decrease on George's
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
bank for a while didn't we
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing a
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
lessening in the number of species of
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
what they were using as bait fish for
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
our lobster traps so they've switched
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
bait species in my understanding as well
 
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
um the previously abundant I don't
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
remember what it was that there was an
 
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.829 align:start position:0%
remember what it was that there was an
attic

01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
attic
 
01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:07.849 align:start position:0%
attic
um

01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
not so abundant now so uh sometimes
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
we're successful sometimes it's not and
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure we've got some great
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
examples of extremely good successes and
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
then we've got some examples of where we
 
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question and it's
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.370 align:start position:0%
hard to
um

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's hard to Define right it's hard to
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
answer in all aspects
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
so under the Magnuson Stevenson Act
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement that you create
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
fishery management plans and further
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
amendments and addendums if need be
 
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:51.500 align:start position:0%
in order to address
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
restoration potential so if you have a
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
species or fishery that's um
 
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
overfishing or overfished
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
then you have a particular time limit
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
that you need to
 
01:09:06.839 --> 01:09:08.150 align:start position:0%
that you need to
um

01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
restore them to
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
to a particular
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
time frame that was a viable Fishery
 
01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:21.620 align:start position:0%
well with climate change
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
are other
 
01:09:24.299 --> 01:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
are other
natural

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
natural
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
resource issues
 
01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:31.460 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily happen
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
so then you try during that time frame
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
say 10-year time frame of restoration
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
you try and continually adjust rules and
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
regulations to
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
um to manage the The Fishery because
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's all you can do you can't manage
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
natural mortality right you can't manage
 
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
what's happening in their environment
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
to a large degree so the pretty much the
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
only thing you can effectively manage is
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
the Fisheries themselves
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately that's when you get
 
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:10.940 align:start position:0%
into these issues that chairman
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
explained was speaking of where the
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
industry is happy at times and not happy
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
at other times because we're constantly
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
having to adjust based on our annual or
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
every three year stock assessment
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
process that creates the data that
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
informs us
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
is if we are
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
still on track
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
with our 10-year restoration plan
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
10-year being example
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
restoration plan
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.130 align:start position:0%
 
it's complex

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's complex
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
and again if if their natural
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
environment is changing such
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
that it's something that the Fisheries
 
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
it's not the Fisheries fault that a
 
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
it's not the Fisheries fault that a
population

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:12.020 align:start position:0%
you can still only
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
regulate the Fisheries
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it doesn't become even
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
more depleted and an example of that as
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
I mentioned earlier is the northern
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
shrimp I think we're in our 13th or 14th
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
year of a moratorium on The Fishery
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's shrimp out there but they're at
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
such low levels that would not be able
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
to sustain The Fishery and their
 
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe she had a part of her
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
question when she was asking how we
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
if we've actually
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
actually we actually restored them to
 
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
their particular levels that we are
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:11:57.719 --> 01:11:58.490 align:start position:0%
trying to
um

01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
get them to in their 10-year period so
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
we always have
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
um a period of time that we know
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
the populations and the Fisheries were
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
doing well so say there was a period of
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
time in
 
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.669 align:start position:0%
time in
um

01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
the 1990s that
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
was a good population to support a
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
particular amount of Fisheries
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
then we would try and restore it to that
 
01:12:29.699 --> 01:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
then we would try and restore it to that
level

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
and that's what those those fishery
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
management plans try and do and try to
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
adjust for
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
how many people we have out there
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
fishing for them which could be
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
diminished or increased based on
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
what the populations were before and how
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
many individuals you had fishing on them
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
so you want to maintain a particular
 
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
number of fishers or Harvesters
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
based on a particular population
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
if you increase the Harvesters and still
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
have this small population then you're
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
in an overfished issue if you have the
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
the same amount of Harvesters but a
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
declining population
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
you still have the same problem of being
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
overfished or overfishing is occurring
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
so you always want to maintain some

get involved in the market
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
and the fishermen
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
aside from providing the guidelines
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
under which they must work
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
so we're not directly financially tied
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
into the results of our fishing and
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have any impact on the revenue
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
that phishing provides to the state
 
01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:09.140 align:start position:0%
aside from
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
our general guidelines that we provide
 
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
for them we don't do any kind of
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
subsidies to the fishermen
 
01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:16.669 align:start position:0%
subsidies to the fishermen
um

01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
and and that sort of thing
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
if a Federal Regulation from Washington
 
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
came down and said that it was going to
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
affect say the type of gear that
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
everyone had to use
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
well then we would have to work to try
 
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there was as little
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
impact to our fishermen as possible
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
while they transitioned into that gear
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
we usually don't do that through the
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
Act of subsidy where we would give them
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
money to purchase the new gear but more
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
in making sure there's enough time
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
available for them to move into the new
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
gear from the old gear without impacting
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
their operations
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
I think that the best situation that we
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
have for all of that industry is that we
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire don't have a sales tax
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to concern ourselves
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
with tax policy that might impact
 
01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:09.620 align:start position:0%
negatively our fishermen
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
and that's probably why we're more of a
 
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
hands-off when it comes to the industry
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
and we focus on funding the department
 
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.370 align:start position:0%
and we focus on funding the department
that

01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:18.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
enforces and governs the the regulations
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
we've put in place that makes the rules
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
that are more Nimble than the laws that
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
we put in place and I believe that we as
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
a partner to these other Fisheries
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
there's there's contributions we make
 
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
into that
 
01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:37.850 align:start position:0%
into that
um

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
so now I'll again toss it over to Cherie
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.649 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
you explained it very well
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
on a state level
 
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's very little opportunity to
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
provide funds to to an industry
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
um that might be
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
in trouble
 
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
however because there's so much
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
interaction with the federal government
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
and these other organizations Atlantic
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
states marine fisheries Commission
 
01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.630 align:start position:0%
states marine fisheries Commission
that

01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there could be disaster funds
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
available congressionally there could be
 
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
available congressionally there could be
um

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
other funds available federal funds that
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
is available
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
to help the industry adjust to rules and
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
regulations whether that be monetarily
 
01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:34.100 align:start position:0%
or whether that be
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
literally the government supplying funds
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
for us to maybe buy the gear and and
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
provide it to the industry if there's
 
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
gear change requirements so it just
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
depends on what the requirements are
 
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:51.169 align:start position:0%
that might be
um

01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:53.780 align:start position:0%
affecting them
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
and as to whether it's a disaster the
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
Atlantic hearing which is senator's plan
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
Senate a representative displaying I'm
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I just elevated him
 
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.750 align:start position:0%
sorry I just elevated him
um

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
indicated that we've had a collapse of
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic hearing population in the
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:18.350 align:start position:0%
as a result
um

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
for bait species
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
the lobster industry has had to move to
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
menhaven species which is a very robust
 
01:20:31.209 --> 01:20:31.219 align:start position:0%
population along the east coast now
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
and they harvest them for the use of
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
bait because the regulations now to
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
harvest Atlanta caring are very strict
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
and very constricting
 
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.530 align:start position:0%
and very constricting
so

01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.590 align:start position:0%
the state
um

01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:51.010 --> 01:20:51.020 align:start position:0%
as well as the other states between
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and Maine declared to the
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to see a Fisheries
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
disaster being declared so that goes in
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
front of Congress congress makes those
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
decisions as to whether they will fund
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
Fisheries disasters such as those
 
01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
and then once all that clears the
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
federal process
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
then funds come to each state and the
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
state disperses Fish and Game disperses
 
01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:27.140 align:start position:0%
those funds to those that were affected
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
just a quick question
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
a lot I know a lot of fish and games
 
01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
funding is self-funded through licenses
 
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
from Sportsman other things what
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
percentage of your overall budget
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
ballpark is uh self-funded and how much
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
um for fish and game it is primarily a
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency
 
01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:09.980 align:start position:0%
we also
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to get
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
for some of our a lot of our work
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
federal funds through
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
U.S fish and wildlife service or NOAA
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
fisheries and such
 
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
and that percentage
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
technically it's
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
75-25 but in reality it is not it's uh a
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
little bit less you know like 60 40
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
percent uh fish and game funds to to
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:45.050 align:start position:0%
federal funds
um

01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's it Fish and Game struggles at times
 
01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
because we are constrained we do have
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
some general funds that comes to the
 
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.790 align:start position:0%
some general funds that comes to the
Department

01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh for example for search and rescue
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
because it's not just the stakeholders
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
the fish and game stakeholders your
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
Anglers your hunters and such that are
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
lost or need rescuing and such so there
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
is some general funds that come to fish
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
and game but it's uh
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
primarily a
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
self-sourcing agency
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
and we get a
 
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
bunch of money in the Pitman act from
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
purchase of uh angling gear and hunting
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
equipment uh ammunition and such correct
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
correct those are those are where some
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds come from
 
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:40.220 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds come from
absolutely

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:42.890 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:44.209 align:start position:0%
[Music]
uh

01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:47.209 align:start position:0%
uh
sorry

01:23:47.209 --> 01:23:47.219 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:23:47.219 --> 01:24:38.570 align:start position:0%
sorry
foreign

01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay another good question
 
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.649 align:start position:0%
okay another good question
um

01:24:41.649 --> 01:24:41.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
the way that we govern
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
um the industry bringing fish into our
 
01:24:50.209 --> 01:24:50.219 align:start position:0%
state for sale is through the landing of
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
the fish if they bringing the fish into
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
a port in New Hampshire they have to be
 
01:24:58.729 --> 01:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
licensed to land the fish here and they
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
buy those licenses
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have as the United States something
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
in our Constitution called the Commerce
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
Clause which prohibits one state from
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
charging any kind of tariffs on another
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
state for the importing or exporting of
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
of things between states so there's
 
01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:18.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely no
 
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
collaboration needed even if it's a
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
migratory species of fish for a
 
01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
person who's licensed to land the fish
 
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to then sell them to
 
01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
somebody who doesn't live here
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
and now again I'll throw it to Sheree in
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
so you've heard me speak about the
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
council and the commission where the
 
01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
asmfc and the New England fisheries
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
management Council those are made up of
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
all the states so when a fishery policy
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
management decision is made
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
all of the states enacted so they they
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
should be the same up and down the coast
 
01:26:06.189 --> 01:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
for where those where those fish species
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
exist an example would be
 
01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
exist an example would be
um

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know striped bass
 
01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.870 align:start position:0%
I don't know striped bass
where

01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
everybody has the same regulation
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
or harvest
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
States can be more conservative than
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
what the policy that all the states
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.390 align:start position:0%
voted on
have

01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.530 align:start position:0%
have
but

01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:34.250 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
as for creating equal rules and
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
regulations that's what those
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
organizations do and as Representatives
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
Blaine indicated that a lot of times the
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations for Commerce come
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
into effect as to how they can be
 
01:26:56.219 --> 01:26:56.870 align:start position:0%
into effect as to how they can be
um

01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
discluded or included
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
or Mr chairman I want to know how
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
important the Fisheries industry for New
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how is the presentation
 
01:27:24.649 --> 01:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
itself Fisheries comparing to the other
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
industry and I'm sure it's going to
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
impact for the state to make the
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
priority for any Fisheries policies
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
so the Fisheries in New Hampshire are
 
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
so the Fisheries in New Hampshire are
not

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
our biggest industry in New Hampshire
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
but the lobster industry is our biggest
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
fishery in New Hampshire uh as far as
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that it brings into
 
01:27:49.450 --> 01:27:49.460 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
the state
[Music]

01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:50.159 --> 01:27:51.010 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:51.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:52.850 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
I would say that uh probably number one
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
we might be up there with paper and
 
01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:59.209 align:start position:0%
we might be up there with paper and
Timber

01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
Timber
 
01:27:59.219 --> 01:28:02.169 align:start position:0%
Timber
um

01:28:02.169 --> 01:28:02.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
anybody else got any idea what our other
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
top industries are I know we've got a
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
huge blossoming biomed industry now and
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
the high tech has always been uh doing
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
well and it's doing better and now that
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
there's more remote working
 
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.070 align:start position:0%
there's more remote working
um

01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative Ming do you have anything
 
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
to add to that
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's the medical industry
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
I think that that might be our topic
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay uh anybody else
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
rep roulette
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
I know in the northern half of the state
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
it's the tourist industry is really the
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
largest industry I almost forgot tourism
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
I mean uh but yeah no I mean uh
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
we we're blessed here with a
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
multi-seasonal tourist industry in other
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
words in the winter time we don't shut
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
down completely we shift our tourism to
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
ski areas and winter sports
 
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh winter activities like ice fishing
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
and things that people do in the
 
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
outdoors and then in the summertime it's
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
of course summer tourists hiking uh
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
tourism throughout all of our mountain
 
01:29:09.729 --> 01:29:09.739 align:start position:0%
ranges plus also on the Seacoast
 
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
although as we mentioned the water stays
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
pretty darn cold so it swimming is not a
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
big thing even in even in our warmest
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
months it's still cold enough that you
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
um you'll get goosebumps when you go in
 
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
the water
 
01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.950 align:start position:0%
the water
um

01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
yeah but I'd say lobster is do you know
 
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
how many what the dollar amount is
 
01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.430 align:start position:0%
how many what the dollar amount is
approximately

01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's in the five million dollar range
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
for just Landings that doesn't include
 
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
the economics associated with the
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and such five million is
 
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
only for lobster or all the Fisheries
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
that would be just the lobster portion I
 
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.510 align:start position:0%
that would be just the lobster portion I
believe

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.830 align:start position:0%
believe
so

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.910 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
it's probably down around our fourth or
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
fifth probably I would say the fisheries
 
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
and we have a very short coastline
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
of all the New England states we've got
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
the shortest
 
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
um and so it's uh what 16 miles or
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
something like that 18. yeah if you want
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
to stretch it it's 18. if we count the
 
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
all around the Isle of Shoals we can add
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
in a couple
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
um it's very short so
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
um that's why we don't have large scale
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
um Fisheries of other types we don't
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
um Fisheries that choose to have a uh
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
presence on our Seacoast that go out
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
into those international waters or into
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
the the Deep federal waters to do the
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
deep sea net fishing or any of that and
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
we've got very strict regulations on how
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
Nets can be used along our Coastline so
 
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
um that's why it ends up being the
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
lobster that brings in the most uh it's
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
the one that's constantly going
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
year-round the other ones tend to be
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
smaller in nature
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
but although we do have I think it's the
 
01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
smallest Coastline in the United States
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island is a little bigger than we
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
are so yes we have the smallest
 
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
Coastline in the U.S here in New
 
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I think it's important
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
it may not just be a a dollar figure a
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
lot of people come here
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
because of the coastline and a lot of
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
those people that are coming here are
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
recreational fishermen and of course
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
that that spins off to boat sales and
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
all of those other spin-offs that happen
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
because of the folks coming here to do
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
the fishing so you may not because it's
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
such a small Coastline you may not be
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
able to just compare the the money
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
exactly compared to the rest of the
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
state but it's a it's a really important
 
01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
piece of what New Hampshire is as our
 
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
Coastline and the attraction that it has
 
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
for people to come here
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I I and I think
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of these are great questions for
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
Wednesday afternoon
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
when you're going to see the Yankee
 
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
Fisherman's Cooperative who would have
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
maybe slightly different uh ideas than
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
I want to share uh something that may be
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
quite different in our country so in
 
01:32:26.219 --> 01:32:27.470 align:start position:0%
quite different in our country so in
your

01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:30.380 align:start position:0%
in the state maybe or in Eastern nation
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
individual fishermen should have a
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
permit yeah
 
01:32:37.129 --> 01:32:37.139 align:start position:0%
so in Indonesia when you go to Indonesia
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
then you don't need a permit to do
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
fishing so you can fishing all you want
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
you can catch all your ads uh but uh I
 
01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't count that that
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
assessment for that because um because
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh fishermen sometimes they get the fish
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
that the individual who fishing and
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
sometimes they didn't care if they did
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
get this wasting time for that and then
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
also some practice that some people who
 
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
do the aquaculture they do something
 
01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
like a charity when they release some of
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
their larvae or the fried to the to the
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
nature even though they didn't assess
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
also the survival rate
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
thus those uh fish alive or not but they
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
do that for generous to the generosity
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
to the to the nature so yeah
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
maybe uh This Is this different part
 
01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.530 align:start position:0%
maybe uh This Is this different part
because

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
we still didn't get direct effect to the
 
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh how to say the global warming and
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
season changing and so on but I'm sure
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
in the future those will happen also in
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
Us in the Tropic area so that make me uh
 
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
make me build a one of concern that uh
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
we Indonesia should start anticipating
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
and regulate somehow in order to sustain
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
because uh we cannot just uh rely on
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
just relax and so on and so on because
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
when those happen maybe or they need too
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
late to to our country so yeah very
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
great information for for you all to me
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's very interesting um
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
I would say that
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
without a huge buy-in of cooperation
 
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
it is almost impossible to
 
01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:39.649 align:start position:0%
it is almost impossible to
um

01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
manage species even if you have the data
 
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
unless you know how many people are
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
fishing and you have uh somehow
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
permitted them and I'm not going to
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
advocate for Indonesia to start charging
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
fishermen for licenses however uh a
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary registration of uh who's
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
fishing and what they're fishing for
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
gives you data that allows you to then
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
balance out where you need to expend
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
your effort and monitor more closely the
 
01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.090 align:start position:0%
your effort and monitor more closely the
species

01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
species
 
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.370 align:start position:0%
species
um

01:35:15.370 --> 01:35:15.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
and so so I would say that without that
 
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
kind of data it's very difficult you can
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
have all of the info on the fish numbers
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
that you want from surveying them but if
 
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
you don't know how many people are
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
fishing for them uh you're missing a big
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
key point there I remember that many
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
years back you did not need a license at
 
01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:41.060 align:start position:0%
all if you were fishing in New Hampshire
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
in the ocean
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
the federal government put down a a
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
permit requirement and now you need a
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
license to fish in the ocean as well as
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
in our Inland Waters that we've always
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
charged a license fee for and that
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
license fee
 
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
not only protects the habitat and the
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
fish hatcheries and such but it allows
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
them to know how many people are fishing
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that people are following
 
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
guidelines as far as how many fish a day
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
they can take and such
 
01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:23.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.169 --> 01:36:27.179 align:start position:0%
sorry uh just want to make clear the
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
explanation from the MR Henke that so in
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
urban home so for the small scale at
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
this for the Artisan accessories they
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't need a license but they have still
 
01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.870 align:start position:0%
don't need a license but they have still
uh

01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
to report their catch and we also have
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
the system for that and then for the
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
small efforts I'm sorry for the
 
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
industrial scale and they need a permit
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
to get the fishing so you are true that
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
the data is very very important for us
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
too many TV series and then uh I have a
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
question for uh for you in here uh I
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you apply the quarter
 
01:37:06.189 --> 01:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
system or not and then
 
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh if you apply the quarter I hear from
 
01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.570 align:start position:0%
uh if you apply the quarter I hear from
uh

01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
fabulous uh day before that they have to
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
pay for the uh quota before they go
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
fishing and then what I want to know uh
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
how do you set a how do you charge the
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
number of amount that they have to pay
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
for the quota let's say for headache
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
let's say is a two dollar per pound or
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
are you talking about Commerce yeah but
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
I was a Commerce
 
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
you know we don't regulate commerce we
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
don't so am I am I misinterpreting this
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
if I interpret it correctly if we put a
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
quota on on fishermen that they can only
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
take in a certain amount how do we
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
charge for that how do we how do we
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
charge for our licensing that allows
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
them to take in and where do we cap a
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
quota uh do we have quotas too was a
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
question in there yeah
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
do we have quotas do we have um limits
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
that they can hit annually and they
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
can't do anymore uh they have to switch
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
to another species if these things uh
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
how are they charged as well do we
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
charge people by how many pounds they
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
bring into the in based on in that is
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
that how their licensing is done or is
 
01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
it done as a a flat fee licensing system
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
those were the questions as far as I
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
flat fee essentially our licenses are
 
01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:39.530 align:start position:0%
flat fee essentially our licenses are
issued

01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
um based on
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
what the department needs essentially
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
and I know we have a commercial level
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but then we've also got some
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
personal ones so that's a breakdown it's
 
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
flat for commercial fishermen and then
 
01:38:57.530 --> 01:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's another fee separate different one
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
if you're just a personal private
 
01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.250 align:start position:0%
if you're just a personal private
fisherman

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
fisherman
 
01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.450 align:start position:0%
fisherman
um

01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
we also have just permits where they
 
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay at all it's just you
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
know like a registration system and such
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
but it it's
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
um no it's not based on on what they're
 
01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
coming in with or what they're Landing
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's just based on
 
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.510 align:start position:0%
it's just based on
um

01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.490 align:start position:0%
um
actually

01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
what department feels it needs for its
 
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
what department feels it needs for its
income

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:38.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't each of our licenses
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
carry with it a limit on take for most
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
so each if I go fishing I can only take
 
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
x amount of trout per day of X size
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't connect to funding
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
but there are limits yes there are
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
limits there are quotas again primarily
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
what a population can withstand for a
 
01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:15.290 align:start position:0%
what a population can withstand for a
harvest

01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
harvest
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
it it's not um
 
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's not based on income for the
 
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
department or for the state
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's based on
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
the quotas are based on
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
what the populations can handle for
 
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.350 align:start position:0%
what the populations can handle for
fishery

01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
fishery
 
01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
um Fisheries that are fishing off of it
 
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
and still maintain a sustainable
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
population and sustained a sustainable
 
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.729 align:start position:0%
population and sustained a sustainable
Fishery

01:40:42.729 --> 01:40:42.739 align:start position:0%
Fishery
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
and as far as commercially
 
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
Cherie do we have a cap on what a
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
commercial fisherman can land per day or
 
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
per month or per season
 
01:40:59.570 --> 01:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh you know it depends on the species
 
01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:00.290 align:start position:0%
uh you know it depends on the species
um

01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
again through our collaborative
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and such yes there there
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
can be quotas placed on
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
commercial some commercial Industries
 
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:15.380 align:start position:0%
there could be a limit on how many
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
licenses are available
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
to to be able to fish you know that's a
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
type of quota also again you know when
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're when you're trying to maintain a
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable population is the population
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
and the number of of uh Fisheries that
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
are going after that population you can
 
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
only you can only control the Fisheries
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
you can't control natural mortality or
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of issue so there's several
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
ways of controlling Fisheries whether
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
that be quotas whether that be the
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
number of licenses that are allowed to
 
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
fish for for those species and such
 
01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
so to tie this all up with a nice little
 
01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:58.910 align:start position:0%
so to tie this all up with a nice little
bow

01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
bow
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
we have a department that is essentially
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
self-funded through license fees that is
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
our fishing game Wildlife Management
 
01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:08.990 align:start position:0%
our fishing game Wildlife Management
Department

01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
and they determine licensed pricing for
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
everything that has to do with needing a
 
01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:17.219 align:start position:0%
license from hunting to the fishing
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
aspect based on what the department
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
needs to balance their budget
 
01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:25.139 align:start position:0%
also taking into account what is
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
somebody willing to pay for a license if
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
the price goes too high you'll have less
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
of them and now you've got a problem
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
with managing the species
 
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's that end then we have the quota
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
ends which is usually one of those data
 
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
points that's a collaborative effort
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
um associations that we belong with for
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic Sea Coast and for the North
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
Atlantic states
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that might mean that we're not
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
issuing as many licenses for commercial
 
01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
fishermen because we have a problem we
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
might put a quota on how many they can
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
take in in a season
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
but we don't charge them based on what
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
they bring in
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
they pay the flat rate for the license
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
so in your case is that what Indonesia
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
does if if I if I bring in a hundred
 
01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
pounds of fish I have to pay this much
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
and if I bring in a thousand pounds of
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
fish I have to pay more is that what you
 
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.070 align:start position:0%
fish I have to pay more is that what you
do

01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so in Arabic on previously uh if
 
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
you want to go fishing you have a need a
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
license in the permit and then the
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
permit is depend on the how much or how
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
bigger the uh vessel do you use in terms
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
of the Commerce you're facing you know
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
and it's uh based on the productivity of
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
the fishing gear and the vessel so the
 
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
relation between gear and the vessel and
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
then we calculate based on the gate the
 
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.070 align:start position:0%
then we calculate based on the gate the
groston

01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
groston
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
let's say you have the vessel 100 gross
 
01:43:58.679 --> 01:43:59.450 align:start position:0%
let's say you have the vessel 100 gross
stones

01:43:59.450 --> 01:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
stones
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
it costs uh maybe uh expensive for the
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
vessel with the
 
01:44:09.970 --> 01:44:09.980 align:start position:0%
uh more larger size
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
they should pay more expensive for for
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
the permit and right now we try to tune
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
a transform from the uh what we saw in
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
what we call in here is like a lending
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
fee so right now we uh
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
apply the program for the lending fee
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
they the permit is free and then when
 
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
they catch the fees they get the fees
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay so it is a bit different
 
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
yeah it's essentially like a a tax on
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
the amount of productivity you have
 
01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:52.850 align:start position:0%
the amount of productivity you have
um

01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why I wonder in here how
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
much the person uh pay for the permit or
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
license what does a commercial fishing
 
01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:08.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look that up but for
 
01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.950 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look that up but for
non-residents

01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
non-residents
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
um a commercial license uh commercial
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
salt water license might be I think it's
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
500 for an for a resident I think it's
 
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.330 align:start position:0%
500 for an for a resident I think it's
300

01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
300
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
um there's there's some graduations of
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
um of some commercial licenses our
 
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
Lobster industry you have your your 1200
 
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
trap you have your 600 trap you have
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
your 100 trap and you have your
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
recreational so you have these
 
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
graduations based on
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
um you know it it varies based on the
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
size of the fishing organization so if
 
01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
I've got a lobster boat and I'm only
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
going to put out 600 traps I buy the 600
 
01:45:58.850 --> 01:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
trap license and anything up to 600
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
traps I can do for that flat fee
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay and if I'm running a bigger
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
operation with two boats and I need 1200
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
now I'm buying the 1200 license and I
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
can go up to 1200 traps it's still a
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
flat price for the license and we don't
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
have a tax in New Hampshire for sales or
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
any of that so
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
um we don't charge them when they bring
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
them in
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
um the fee is strictly for the license
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
for the ability to go out and then of
 
01:46:31.609 --> 01:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
course they're subject to enforcement so
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
if they get fish and game comes up
 
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
alongside they're going to make sure
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
they're not taking short lobsters
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
they're not taking lobsters with eggs
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not breaking any
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
other rules regarding the way that
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're putting their traps out or any
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
of that stuff
 
01:46:48.179 --> 01:46:50.570 align:start position:0%
of that stuff
um

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.810 --> 01:46:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.850 --> 01:46:57.860 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
inspect the landings correct
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
you sometimes Fish and Game enforcement
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
will go out to make sure they're
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
following a law but we don't inspect the
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
landings and count every
 
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
amount that is brought in by each
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
we have a data collection programs that
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
we will intercept boats on docks and
 
01:47:33.010 --> 01:47:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
the individual Harvester
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
and the dealer to report particular data
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
but no we don't literally go out there
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
we don't meet them in and count every
 
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
fish it comes off it's the dealer
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
um that supplies us with the actual
 
01:47:53.209 --> 01:47:53.219 align:start position:0%
Landings data and it's a harvester that
 
01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
supplies us with the effort data you
 
01:47:58.090 --> 01:47:58.100 align:start position:0%
know that they went out for 12 hours
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
with this particular gear came in with
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
this estimate number of of harvest so
 
01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
that we can assess effort involved in
 
01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:13.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
so so if I'm on the Quan Flats I don't
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
know what the limit is used to be a five
 
01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
gallon pail and I take two five gallon
 
01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
pails I'm not going to meet a game
 
01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:26.219 align:start position:0%
warden when I'm coming off the game
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
flats or the coin flaps of course you
 
01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.330 align:start position:0%
flats or the coin flaps of course you
will

01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
right do you want me to
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
so when we have our Landings inspected
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
by fish and game what they're doing is
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
they're collecting data and they're
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
looking for violations of the
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
regulations okay
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're not charging fees
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that happens at the
 
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
Landing as far as a fee goes is you've
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
got a dealer who's agreed to buy the
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
fish and you've got a fisherman who's
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
supplying the fish and that's a private
 
01:49:01.609 --> 01:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
deal between them
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't take any money out of
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
that deal at all but what we do is we
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
collect the data
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
from the fishermen
 
01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:11.699 align:start position:0%
and the data from the dealers
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's how we add to our big bucket
 
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
of data that allows us to determine how
 
01:49:29.209 --> 01:49:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.729 --> 01:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
we have 10 minutes left if anybody wants
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
I have a question but this is maybe like
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
out of the Fisheries topic so this
 
01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:45.380 align:start position:0%
morning my interpreter
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
I mentioned to ask some interesting fact
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
that we want just to know uh
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
is it a good lesson so you can ask us
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
anything yeah yeah we heard the fact
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
that you as a representative is the one
 
01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:05.410 align:start position:0%
who paid very high in the United States
 
01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:08.510 align:start position:0%
who paid very high in the United States
[Laughter]

01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
So based on The Interpreter mentioned to
 
01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:13.970 align:start position:0%
So based on The Interpreter mentioned to
us

01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
as a as a state representative in New
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you earn a hundred dollars a
 
01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.209 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you earn a hundred dollars a
year

01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:20.219 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's it and that's before taxes and
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
before you buy your business cards and
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
your ties and anything else that's
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't have a tie I'm broke
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but uh it's yes uh because we have
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
400 state representatives as I mentioned
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
with the third largest democratically
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
elected English-speaking body in the
 
01:50:42.239 --> 01:50:43.609 align:start position:0%
elected English-speaking body in the
world

01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and if we it's in our Constitution
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
and it's been there since the 1800s or
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
so with it they got paid a hundred
 
01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
dollars a year for their service and
 
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
none of us is going to go there and
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
change the Constitution to get paid more
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
so we're strictly a volunteer
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
legislature we all have our day jobs or
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
we're retired or what have you and uh
 
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
and we do not make any money at all we
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
have no staff as a chairman I have an
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
office that I share with the vice chair
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
and another committee chairman so
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
um most everybody here just has a drawer
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
in a file cabinet and that's it
 
01:51:21.239 --> 01:51:22.070 align:start position:0%
in a file cabinet and that's it
um

01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
and that's it's a good question
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
um but if you go to other states you'll
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
find that they're some of the highest
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
paid uh people around but not in New
 
01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.189 align:start position:0%
paid uh people around but not in New
Hampshire

01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
here because it's different from yeah we
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
just know maybe if we started charging
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
them by how many pounds of fish they
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
brought up we could pay everybody more
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
but we don't do that
 
01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
um and how does it work in Indonesia uh
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's quite different yeah they already
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
have regulation for setting up the uh
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative costs and salary and so
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
I'd follow up I think this is my first
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
term here
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pride in all the
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
representatives here that we are a
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
volunteer group we take that as a very
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
it's a very personal thing there's a lot
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
of Pride here that we aren't here for
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
the money and that we're here for for
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
our citizens and it's
 
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
um in fact we it was brought up to give
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
us a raise this year and we voted that
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
down because of the the economic
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
conditions but uh and we had the
 
01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
conversation that if we were to get paid
 
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:35.699 align:start position:0%
a lot more money it would change the
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
whole feel of this place and the way
 
01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
that people respond we think
 
01:52:42.649 --> 01:52:42.659 align:start position:0%
for example also out there um it's not
 
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
just us the Senators there's 24 of them
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
and they only get paid 100 a year as
 
01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:49.850 align:start position:0%
and they only get paid 100 a year as
well

01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
we don't need term limits
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
because most people can only handle
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
being here for free for a certain amount
 
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
of time and then they decide I'm done
 
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
and someone new runs okay it's not an
 
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
elected for Life type of thing because
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to do this forever for a
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year and
 
01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.810 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year and
um

01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
every two years our entire government in
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is reelected
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
from the governor straight down to us
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
the only offices that are different are
 
01:53:23.209 --> 01:53:23.219 align:start position:0%
the federal Offices because they follow
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
federal law for their terms their length
 
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
of terms but the governor the executive
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
Council the Senate and the state
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
representatives here in the in the House
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
of Representatives are all elected every
 
01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
two years wow
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
so if you think you made a mistake in
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
two years you get to vote them out and
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
get somebody new
 
01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:44.629 align:start position:0%
get somebody new
[Laughter]

01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
and I will say I am one of the crazies
 
01:53:50.689 --> 01:53:50.699 align:start position:0%
here I'm been here 25 years so wow
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
when you uh I notice you're going to be
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
doing a tour of the state house this
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon you'll get to see the house
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
Chambers where all 400 of us sit and we
 
01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:00.229 align:start position:0%
Chambers where all 400 of us sit and we
are

01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:54:02.689 --> 01:54:02.699 align:start position:0%
put in like sardines into a room with
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
our chairs side by side
 
01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:07.460 align:start position:0%
you'll find it interesting
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
curious that you earn 100 a years but
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
does the government give you like
 
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
incentive for the oppressional cause or
 
01:54:19.129 --> 01:54:19.139 align:start position:0%
the facilities like car or super special
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
private jet or whatever
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
so so I'll start out by saying that um
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
we get paid 100 a year I'm not sure that
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
every State Rep earns the hundred
 
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's a number that they don't even
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%
earn it but
 
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
um on top of that I will say that we do
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
get free tolls
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
we get to drive through the tolls
 
01:54:40.729 --> 01:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
without paying
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
um so that's like saving a dollar when
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
you go through you know each time
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and we have uh mileage that we get
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
paid uh so uh it's done at the federal
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
rate which is 65 cents a mile or
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
something like that and the State House
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
knows where we live and where the state
 
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
house is so for the round trip to come
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
from our house to the state house and
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
back we get paid for the mileage of the
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
days that we have to come in here
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
um it's enough for me to essentially buy
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
me a lunch on a day that that I come in
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
um or pay for that gas that I had to use
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
to come in but um there's no other perks
 
01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned we pay for our own
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
business cards
 
01:55:21.709 --> 01:55:21.719 align:start position:0%
um even the special license plates we
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
put on our car we got to pay extra for
 
01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.169 align:start position:0%
put on our car we got to pay extra for
those

01:55:24.169 --> 01:55:24.179 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:55:24.179 --> 01:55:25.390 align:start position:0%
those
so

01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:31.010 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
yeah yes

01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
and mind mine's a special one because
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
this one was made with this the state
 
01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:37.139 align:start position:0%
seal and now we have two state seals in
 
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one is the corporate seal
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
which has the boat and one is the
 
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
non-corporate seal the original seal and
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's the one here that's got a bundle
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
of arrows a pine tree and a fish
 
01:55:51.410 --> 01:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
and this is the original seal before the
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
state was incorporated and the person
 
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
who used to make these was a
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative who passed away some five
 
01:55:59.930 --> 01:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
years ago so you can't get one of these
 
01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:05.750 align:start position:0%
years ago so you can't get one of these
anymore

01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.970 --> 01:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
thanks for sharing any other questions
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be fish and game
 
01:56:09.239 --> 01:56:10.609 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be fish and game
related

01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:56:19.629 --> 01:56:19.639 align:start position:0%
