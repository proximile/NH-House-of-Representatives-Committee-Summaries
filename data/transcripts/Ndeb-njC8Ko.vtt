policy in my life which really

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
careful careful thoughts this way
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
careful what you say that uh that you
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to maybe get in the newspaper
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
or something like that but uh and I I'm
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'm as bad as everybody also uh when you
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
finish speaking uh try to shut it off
 
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
because when you uh you get too many too
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
many mics on and this the system they
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
they don't uh doesn't work as well so it
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
it takes all the juice to the from the
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
it just divides up the uh the power so
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
you've you know so it interferes with
 
00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:46.699 align:start position:0%
the pure person speaking
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of additional things
 
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.090 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of additional things
uh

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I've been asked that
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
talk to folks about the financial
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
disclosure form
 
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of people you have yet to fill it
 
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:02.810 align:start position:0%
a lot of people you have yet to fill it
out

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
it is uh it is a
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
you can you can allow you gotta fined
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
for not to
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
handing it in it's it's a it is a state
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
statute state law but I don't know of
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
anybody who's ever been fined but I
 
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:23.300 align:start position:0%
don't want to be the first one so uh
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
so fill it out get it get it I guess the
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
date the end the the
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
trip date is uh is Friday
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh so try to get it in there is you can
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
put it in through the portal
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
I guess so uh
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
or you could get one and and fill it out
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
anything uh
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative harb representative Vale
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%

have all had the been to the orientation
 
00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:15.949 align:start position:0%

yeah they're that's very I know that's
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
like you know drinking through a fire

know just to obey just to help you uh
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
you know get through the first couple of
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of hearings and uh
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
other than that uh if you as as we're
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
going through if you if there's
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
something you don't understand
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
especially in the beginning there's no
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
such thing as a stupid question you know
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
you don't have you need an answer
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh and you know we'll we'll we'll take
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
that into account and we'll we'll try to
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
answer your question or hopefully
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh so and if you notice the uh with the
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
seating arrangement I tried to do it uh
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
well I've got supposed to try to there's
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of things you would want to
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
you want to be able to to do but one
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
thing we did were able to do uh is
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
fairly fairly reasonably is uh alternate
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh r d
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
to be able to get uh you know people of
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
the different different parties next to
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
each other
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
so that we are we most of the work we do
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
turns out to be fairly bipartisan uh
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
yeah we there there may be a cup there
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
may be a few bills that we're going to
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
be 10 10 on that's the that's the nature
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
of the beast that's but uh you know we
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
we can be we can have a different
 
00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.230 align:start position:0%
we can be we can have a different
opinion

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
but I think we'll all eventually
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
eventually like each other I don't think
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
I've uh
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
actually the only person I never I'm not
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
going to go into that
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
no Rosemary don't look good
 
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.890 align:start position:0%
no Rosemary don't look good
[Laughter]

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:32.900 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
it was somebody from a from my own party
 
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:41.780 align:start position:0%
many many years ago back
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
2011. so anyway
 
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.029 align:start position:0%
2011. so anyway
yes

00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um the days that
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet how many bills you
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
um is this a good time to share that
 
00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:58.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
how how much how many bills we have left
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
or what how many bills do we have now as
 
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
of that we know about we have 17 now so
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
we still have 17. yeah we still have 17
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
now they're uh there will I think
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
I thought there was 50 uh remaining and
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
there's still 50 remaining and we still
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
got extra bills so uh
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
but that's we it may be a possibility of
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
one uh maybe another one but I I you
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
know luck of the draw
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
but uh shouldn't be anything we can't
 
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:42.419 align:start position:0%
easily handle we did get one rather
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
large Bill a large meaning of going to
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
be a lot a lot of testimony a lot of I
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
think you're probably all seeing it now
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the uh the
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
amount of uh writing your amount of
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
emails you're getting and that's the one
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
on the Lake Winnipesaukee
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh speed limit
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's perennial bill seems to show up
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh every uh every year and uh
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
luckily it it was it has been with
 
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.810 align:start position:0%
luckily it it was it has been with
transportation

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
for the last uh five terms or so
 
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.930 align:start position:0%
for the last uh five terms or so
and

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
now they've decided to give it back to
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
us we had it originally
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
I was
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
years ago I was able to get get a change
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
to Transportation but
 
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:39.380 align:start position:0%
now they're back
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's back so we will probably have it
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
that hearing especially in the
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh in the rep in reps Hall
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
because I don't think this room will
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
take it at least that but I'm
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
any other uh any other thoughts
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions uh we will be having I haven't
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
we will eventually be having uh some
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
exact of some executive sessions uh to
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
be able to uh
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
handled the bills that uh that we're
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
getting uh
 
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:24.980 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh those those are yet that's yet to be
 
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.570 align:start position:0%
uh those those are yet that's yet to be
uh

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
yet to be scheduled again we are I'm
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
trying and it seems to be working so far
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
to make Wednesday is our day I think we
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
gotta we don't have so many bills we're
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
not like Municipal and County and an e e
 
00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:50.179 align:start position:0%
DNA which you've got a hundred bills
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
I know I know education has over a
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
hundred bills and
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.100 align:start position:0%
flat out
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
but we're not we have with 17 bills
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
that's that's easy that's that's slower
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
than we had last year
 
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.450 align:start position:0%
than we had last year
okay

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:10.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
is what you get
 
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.750 align:start position:0%
is what you get
so

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.430 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%

00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419 align:start position:0%
any other any other questions or any uh
 
00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:22.669 align:start position:0%
any other any other questions or any uh
as

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
like an answer
 
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.789 align:start position:0%
like an answer
concerns

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh we will normally be is when we uh we
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
have a certain allotted time for the
 
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:36.860 align:start position:0%
bill for the for the bills
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh if Bill runs over
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
we just well we'll keep going and then
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
we'll pick up the the next one and then
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
that uh in the sequence of in the
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
calendar and uh if we finish early on a
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill we'll just take a break we cannot
 
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.490 align:start position:0%
bill we'll just take a break we cannot
start

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of the what's on the calendar
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
other than that uh
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
Oh by well by the way this afternoon we
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
are going to Des
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh we have they'll you'll be seeing a
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
lot of the people that you'll be project
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
that have that the predominance of the
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
bills that we actually take up uh are
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
with the with Des if you notice as for
 
00:24:23.289 --> 00:24:23.299 align:start position:0%
the bills that we have today
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
are not Des I thought it would be rather
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
rather crude to have bills this in the
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
morning and then go see have them and go
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
visit them in the afternoon I think they
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
probably want to have a little bit of
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
time to prepare for
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
right for for their meet and greet so
 
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.510 align:start position:0%
right for for their meet and greet so
yeah

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh we'll get there at 1 30. uh and uh
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
which should be over by three
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
yeah if someone needs you know the uh
 
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
yeah if someone needs you know the uh
it's

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
not locking anybody nobody's locked in
 
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
so but yeah it but it should be over by
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
three uh the speaker wants us to wait to
 
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.950 align:start position:0%
three uh the speaker wants us to wait to
be

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
you use our use the use our time wisely
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
and he he he was like he
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
likes we would like to wanna you know
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
starting at nine and
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
uh ending you could end this light is
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
five I will not do that I mean I will
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
usually end up uh at the end at the end
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
well I will starting to start at nine
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh at the
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
for the the last bill of the day will
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
usually be the longest one and we'll
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
usually schedule that so that we're not
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
here till five
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's not my intention
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
I have I have made a mistake every now
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
and then but we have gone beyond that
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
but not not normally
 
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.590 align:start position:0%
but not not normally
uh

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
any other any other thoughts any other
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
questions if not
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
yeah you'd be back here at uh water up
 
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:21.500 align:start position:0%
right nine
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
forty five for
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the filing of notice of the
 
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
I have a pill that I need to introduce
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal at 12. so I don't not sure
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
when I can make it over there uh you'll
 
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
probably will be trying to be out of
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
problems

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
unless those questions about violence
 
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:06.850 align:start position:0%
unless those questions about violence
yep

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:38.890 align:start position:0%
 
things

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's one of my that's my last
 
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.909 align:start position:0%
that's one of my that's my last
advantage

00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:27:47.169 --> 00:27:47.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
well I was too deep into engineering
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I was making a good money in
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
engineering and it would have to you
 
00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:55.810 align:start position:0%
engineering and it would have to you
know

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:55.820 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
your son was introduced the other day
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
but I couldn't stand is he like four
 
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
how old he's uh 19. yes thank you I
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
think he knows
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
um so back to Timber
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
he can switch his dates to like a
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
Thursday it looks like we're not going
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
to have sessions on the 26th yeah look
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
like they're not which is lucky yeah so
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
maybe we could squeeze them in there I
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
think people will come on the school
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
vacation week that's the school vacation
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
week that's why we don't have a session
 
00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
week that's why we don't have a session
women

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
women
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
no which which vacation in February
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%

00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
pretty old not you know I'm not going
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
away usually the people with kids that
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
go away yeah I think most of those
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
people are not uh young so
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
damn sure is aging you were gonna do one
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
of those things maybe you can you do
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
this thing can you do that question for
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
can I take questions for that yeah you
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
were going to send some thing out or to
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
me to send out to people what's a good
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
day oh you know what um can we do a
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
survey monkey for one day before we just
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
schedule I don't think it will just
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
schedule it for Thursday I mean I only
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
have one and what day is that is it
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
actually March or is it February well we
 
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.850 align:start position:0%
actually March or is it February well we
can

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
I mean I'll check
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
that's the timber Amendment
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
um let me ask so we're we're booked up
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
for all the Wednesdays from here on out
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
right well for a while because I got to
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
schedule the next couple of meetings and
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
then we have the exact sessions so he's
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
got two worst case
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
two more days and then a day for a sofa
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
exec so we may be done in five days but
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
it depends how long all these things
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
take when they carry over
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
oh I see what you're saying yeah we
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
could just push it off until late in
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
February or March
 
00:30:59.649 --> 00:30:59.659 align:start position:0%
we gotta have the
 
00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:01.810 align:start position:0%
we gotta have the
uh

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:01.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
mid-February we have to have to be
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
finished with our early books so as we
 
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.870 align:start position:0%
finished with our early books so as we
got

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh so you'll be done that next week yeah
 
00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:14.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly hopefully there's no uh
 
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
nothing we don't have any work sessions
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
then I'll figure out no I don't have one
 
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:37.570 align:start position:0%
yet I think it's just better to
 
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
yet I think it's just better to
[Music]

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.310 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yeah

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
time the problem the problem with the
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is if we go four or five more
 
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
weeks we won't have a Timber commission
 
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:52.970 align:start position:0%
weeks we won't have a Timber commission
meeting

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
for two three months
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh no because he's taking up all the
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays and we're gonna have
 
00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:00.419 align:start position:0%
well there's probably going to be a
 
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:01.389 align:start position:0%
well there's probably going to be a
break

00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
break
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
at crossover time I would assume
 
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.909 align:start position:0%
at crossover time I would assume
is

00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
yeah you were thinking March anyway
 
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.409 align:start position:0%
yeah you were thinking March anyway
right

00:32:11.409 --> 00:32:11.419 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
I thought we'd have
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
here's what I was thinking the next
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
meeting we're just going to talk about
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
bills have
 
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:34.269 align:start position:0%
bills have
um

00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
so anyway and I'll ask Andy if he's if
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have a meeting the week of a
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
vacation then we can do Wednesday then
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I just think
 
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:51.549 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I just think
foreign

00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm just thinking we got so many I
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
got so many issues to cover before
 
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.470 align:start position:0%
got so many issues to cover before
December

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
December
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
even if four of us show up get the issue
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
done and yeah I don't know but I'll talk
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
no just told me off the top of that he
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
would like to do this for us and he's
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
probably the best person out there but
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's some politics out there
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
some people want to get in on it talk to
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
the legislators so no he's trying to
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
work that out I didn't think we were
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:42.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to get started
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'm open to hearing on
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
174 relative to the filling uh the
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%

um as I just introduced myself but I
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
should have added that I'm also on the
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
um low grade Timber and Emerging Markets
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
commission which is is in the same
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
subject matter as the bill I'm
 
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.370 align:start position:0%
subject matter as the bill I'm

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
um so let me just formally introduce
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
myself for the record I am
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Juliet Harvey Boley
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
representing Tilton and samberton
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
um and I'm introducing house bill 174.
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the filing of notice of an
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
intent to cut timber
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to please refer to
 
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.390 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to please refer to
Amendment

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
003h which I've given you all copies or
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
some of you already printed them out but
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
um we're I'm going to work off of this
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
amendment because it's uh it removes
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
some basic housekeeping things from the
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
original bill which is uh remove some
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
repeated text it fixed the numbering and
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
lettering system and it adds clarific
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
clarification but it didn't change the
 
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
context of the bill so if you could
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
please uh work off of that
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'd appreciate it
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
um but basically I filed this bill on
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Timber
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
Owners Association and it fixes a
 
00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
problem for the Foresters while still
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
providing everything town the town needs
 
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:41.900 align:start position:0%
and has come to expect from this process
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
which works off of the intent to cut
 
00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:48.140 align:start position:0%
timber form
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
woodcutters and Foresters have short
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
windows of time to cut timber
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
their Harvest is dependent on particular
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
weather conditions which you'll hear
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
more about from the actual Foresters
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh and if they don't get a response from
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
towns regarding the paperwork the intent
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
to cut timber in a timely manner which
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
we'll go into millions of dollars of
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
lumber equipment may lie idle leaving
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
them unable to plan or cut in some cases
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
and not knowing if or when they will get
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
a response from the town that was
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
supposed to issue their permit within 15
 
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
days which is the law and it is noted on
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
the permit
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
um so that is the problem the bill seeks
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
to address is uh the notice of intent to
 
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
cut forms are not being sent to dra
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
which is the Department of Revenue
 
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.670 align:start position:0%
which is the Department of Revenue
Administration

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
um not I'm not saying this happens in
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
every case but it happens probably in at
 
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
least six cases last year with six towns
 
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.109 align:start position:0%
least six cases last year with six towns
um

00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
so it puts the timber operations at a
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
standstill which results in a loss of
 
00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.930 align:start position:0%
standstill which results in a loss of
Revenue

00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
which um you'll hear more about how
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
important the timber industry is to one
 
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
of the most forested states in the Union
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh before a Timber Harvest can begin a
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
tax document must be filed with a town
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
and the town is legally obligated to
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
respond which is sign it and notify the
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
landowner of deficiencies so there are
 
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
four deficiencies and they are located
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
on the timber tax form itself and
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
they're very simple
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
um which is just all owners of record
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
have signed so they must check that
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
um they can they can look up in the tax
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
cards who's you know one of the owners
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
how many owners there are
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
um number two the land is not under
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
current use unproductive category the
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
form is complete and accurate
 
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh which is a little bit vague
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
um and any timber tax Bond required has
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
been received so those are the four
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
criteria on the permit itself the law
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
does not say what happens after 15 days
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
if the landowner or logger doesn't hear
 
00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
back from the town
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
the issue occurs in a variety of towns
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
across the state not just in one area
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
so to get into the actual Amendment here
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
I'd like if you could refer to sub
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph C
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
so this bill provides an answer and
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
guidance to what happens after the 15
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
days say the logger you know files they
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
um they contact era to see what's going
 
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
on with the process
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that's it they don't hear anything
 
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.270 align:start position:0%
and that's it they don't hear anything
more

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
um so in that case we have uh
 
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
change the change it to a I won't call
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
it an automatic issue but for lack of a
 
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:00.260 align:start position:0%
better term I'll say it's a
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic issue of permit
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
so we'll allow them to start logging if
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
they haven't heard back but then give
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
the towns an option for tracking them
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
down and ceasing the operations if they
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
need to so
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
they haven't heard back line 30.
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
um if the conditions for approval have
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
not been met the owner may come commence
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
the The Cutting operation in accordance
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
with the intent
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
but if the assessing officials
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
thereafter determine that the conditions
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
of for approval have not been met
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
the assessing officials shall notify the
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
owner and the person responsible for the
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
cutting explaining why the submitted
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
intent does not meet the conditions for
 
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.150 align:start position:0%
intent does not meet the conditions for
signature

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
signature
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
upon delivery of the notice saying
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
please stop the cutting operation shall
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
cease until such conditions are met in
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
the intent to the signed so
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
changing it to Ace like what I'll call a
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
semiotic semi-automatic issue of permit
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
removes the burden in case in the case
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
that a assessing official for the towns
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
just forgotten you know say they put it
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
aside and or they're new and they they
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
seriously just aren't sure how the
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
permit process works and they don't want
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
to approve it but at any rate
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't get formed
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
the logger can now start
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
with the option of the the town can then
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
find them if for some reason
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
they want to fix one of those four
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
deficiencies so this bill does not
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
impact what it doesn't do is impact
 
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
other state and local approvals such as
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
the surface water quality protection act
 
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:50.420 align:start position:0%
the basal area law that leaves forested
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
buffers or it doesn't impact alteration
 
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:56.900 align:start position:0%
of terrain permits all other
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns that are
 
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
addressed in rsas elsewhere and the
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
statute are not affected by this it
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't diminish Town authority to
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
approve and not approve it and attend to
 
00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.770 align:start position:0%
approve and not approve it and attend to
cut

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
cut
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
taxes will still get collected as they
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
um and there's one other issue one other
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
item on here but I'm going to have
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the speakers that are coming after me
 
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.790 align:start position:0%
um the speakers that are coming after me
address

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:28.220 align:start position:0%
the addition of the five business days
 
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:32.420 align:start position:0%
which is on line 24. it was something
 
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
that dra
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:41.420 align:start position:0%
was consulted and asked for their input
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
and they suggested this five business
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
day clarification
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
instead of the assessing officials shout
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
immediately forward
 
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's more reasonable to say five
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
business days which I agree so I thank
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
you very much and I will be happy to
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
do any questions by members of the
 
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:05.930 align:start position:0%
do any questions by members of the
committee

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:11.089 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative on line 28 of the
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
amendment it talks about the uh intent
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
is not signed by the assessing officials
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
within 15 days is that 15 calendar days
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
or business days because I noticed in
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
line 24 it it's fifth with within five
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
business days
 
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative from
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
the 15 days in line 28 refers back to
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
the 15 uh I'm sorry line number 14 which
 
00:50:46.319 --> 00:50:47.390 align:start position:0%
the 15 uh I'm sorry line number 14 which
is

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
um in the original language
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
and I am not sure if that is calendar
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
calendar days I guess yeah okay thank
 
00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.630 align:start position:0%
calendar days I guess yeah okay thank
you

00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're welcome any other questions from
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative wolf for a question
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
um I see this as a potential problem
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
with assessing officials and getting it
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
to the selectment or the governing
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
entity in town that it can be held up
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
especially if you have outside assessors
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
in the town and I think that's where we
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
may have some issues in some of these
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
towns that haven't
 
00:51:37.569 --> 00:51:37.579 align:start position:0%
delivered these things in a
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
proper time proper time
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think there needs to be some work
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
between assessing officials and the
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
reporting officials and uh I believe
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's the select one have to ultimately
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
sign off on it and I don't see any
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
reference to that in here so I'm just
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
concerned that I think the intent of the
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
bill is great but I think it needs some
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative harp for a question
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm also focusing on the 15 days I
 
00:52:22.089 --> 00:52:22.099 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to read the entire
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
RSA 79 do you happen to know if the 15
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
if the notice has to be sent by
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
certified or registered mail because I
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
wonder when do they start the 15 day
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.270 align:start position:0%
um thank you
um

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
I don't I mean the 15 days is so they
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so dra has to get back the town has
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
to get back to them
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
there isn't anything in here about
 
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
sending it certified but as I understand
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
it and I'm sure uh Mr stock will clarify
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of this too but um
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Correspondence that
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
goes on by email such as like you're you
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
know what I understand you're cleared to
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
go your permit's been signed you may
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
start now
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure some towns I know because I
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
have worked for a town and I before this
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
I worked I was on the planning board for
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
like six years
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm all Vaguely Familiar with some of
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
this um some towns will will um
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
will send things certified mail when
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
they are not required to so it's it's I
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
think it's up to the um is up to the
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
town really there's no sometimes send
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
everything's you know we're more likely
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
to send things certified mail than than
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
other towns which may know and be
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with the logger and just uh
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
communicate casually with them is that
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
maybe he was big and this is honest
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt maybe some of these
 
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.849 align:start position:0%

um in setting this up
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
because this is the first time they've

been in front of a lot of you I figured
 
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
of introduce Who We Are
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%

well as the state's Forest products
industry

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
so you have some information there's
 
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
kind of two parts to your package one is
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
some general information the other is
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
some information that's quite specific
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
to the the piece of legislation we're
 
00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:06.049 align:start position:0%
to the the piece of legislation we're
discussing

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
00:58:06.059 --> 00:58:06.650 align:start position:0%
discussing
um

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
a little bit about us nhtoa we were
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
founded in 1911 we have about 1200 1300
 
00:58:13.079 --> 00:58:14.210 align:start position:0%
founded in 1911 we have about 1200 1300
members

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
and we represent Timberland owners and
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
of course we we also represent as I like
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
to say the entire food chain loggers
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
Foresters Sawmills biomass or wood chip
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
power plants
 
00:58:30.049 --> 00:58:30.059 align:start position:0%
um and yes paper mills so we are not we
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
are not bashful about using paper
 
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
we support our members by using paper as
 
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.030 align:start position:0%
we support our members by using paper as
well

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:38.809 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:41.780 align:start position:0%
we do three things we do advocacy work
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
but we also do education we have a
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive education industry
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
educational program for for folks in the
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
industry logging professionals as well
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
as Sawmills and wood processors
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
everything from safety to best
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
management practices for erosion control
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
and water quality
 
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and safe chainsaw operation we do a
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
lot of this work in cooperation with the
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
UNH University of New Hampshire Thompson
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
School of applied science but also UNH
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension so we work very
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
closely and we run a a certification
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
program for logging professionals and so
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's part of kind of who we are
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
what we do the the third thing we do is
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
we do Communications and Outreach a
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
reporter wants to know what do
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
landowners think we've got this new bug
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
on this scene called emerald ash borer
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
what do landowners think about that many
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
times where the the organization I don't
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
get the call and say all right
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
you know this is what the state's Ash
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
resource looks like this is our concern
 
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.030 align:start position:0%
resource looks like this is our concern
Etc

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
so that's a little bit about who we are
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
and and I included my business card you
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
have a copy of our magazine that's our
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
latest magazine that we we just
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
published give you a little flavor of
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
what we do who we are and if you ever
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
have any questions feel free to call me
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
Timberland in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the second most
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
forested state in the nation we're about
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
83 percent forested
 
01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:17.210 align:start position:0%
83 percent forested
um

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
I talk to folks unfamiliar with the
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
state you say who's the most forested
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
State what are the top three they said
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
well Alaska Washington Oregon and that's
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
not true as a percent of land base New
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the second behind Maine
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
um we have our Our Land base is about I
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
believe the number is 72 percent is
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
private privately owned
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
um very different than out west where
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's almost the opposite a lot of a lot
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
of federally owned land out west here in
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
the in the Northeast
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um much of the land three quarters of it
 
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:55.700 align:start position:0%
is privately owned uh
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
the these and
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
let me see here
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
seven and ten percent is state and local
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
and the FED Zone about 18 White Mountain
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
National Forest some Wildlife refuges so
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the the
 
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
federal government does own a pretty
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
good piece of New Hampshire real estate
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
but on the whole private land it's about
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
75 percent
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
um landowners in New Hampshire come in

hundreds of thousands of Acres
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
principally up north in the northern
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
part of the state if you look at the
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
state and break it into thirds if you
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
think of the state as kind of
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
the northern tip down to the White
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
Mountains a lot of the Timber up there
 
01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:54.140 align:start position:0%
is it's more of a boreal forest
 
01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:56.660 align:start position:0%
Spruce fur
 
01:01:59.809 --> 01:01:59.819 align:start position:0%

the White Mountains down through the
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
down into the Lakes Region you have

a lot of sugar maple Yellow Birch you do
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
get some ash in there as well and then
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
if you think of the bottom third of the
 
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.309 align:start position:0%
if you think of the bottom third of the
state

01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's more of a pine pine Oak Forest and
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
then if you get right down on the coast
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
or on the bottom very bottom of the
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
state you start getting some real
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
interesting species in in that area
 
01:02:29.089 --> 01:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
you'll get a little bit of cherry you
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
get sometimes Hickory and some other
 
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
White Oaks that start to mix in so we
 
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:36.260 align:start position:0%
have a very diverse Forest
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
our forest right now and I provided you
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
a copy this is of this neat document
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
from this U.S department of Agriculture
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is they do a they have a survey a
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
forest survey program called fia the
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
forest inventory analysis
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
and throughout the state there are
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of secret
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
test plots and they go out and across
 
01:03:06.609 --> 01:03:06.619 align:start position:0%
these plots across the state they do
 
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
analysis on what's growing what's
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
removed they test everything not only
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
the types of trees the growth how much
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
biomass is there right on down the line
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
and this is a program that's been in
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
place for many decades and so you're
 
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
able to start developing some Trends but
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bars on the right
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
hand side of this
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
you'll see that our annual growth
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
is around 310 million cubic feet
 
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:42.500 align:start position:0%
mortality is 106 removals logging is
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
112. our net is 92 meaning we continue
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
to grow more wood in the state of New
 
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than we Harvest and that is
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
dying of natural mortality
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
our forests are getting older
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and just like us as you get older you
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
grow slower
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
and so we're watching this you know as
 
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
an as as landowners and as an industry
 
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
we watch this growth curve pretty
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
closely but we're happy to say that we
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
continue to grow more wood than we
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
Harvest and we have a very healthy and a
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
very resilient Forest unlike you see out
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
west where you'll have uh wildfires and
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
some of the crazy natural natural
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
catastrophes hit our forests tend to be
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
quite resilient in that and part of it
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
is the diversity of tree species our
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
humid environment
 
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.870 align:start position:0%
humid environment
Etc

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
shift gears talk about the industry you
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
also have in your packet
 
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:43.460 align:start position:0%
a document called Forest Products
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
Industries economic contribution
 
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's this document
 
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.809 align:start position:0%
that's this document
um

01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:53.660 align:start position:0%
this is just the executive summary
 
01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
there are web links to this and if
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
someone wants to watch a printed copy
 
01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:00.740 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to print it for you
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
but this this was an economic analysis
 
01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:06.059 align:start position:0%
that looked at the forest products
 
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:09.500 align:start position:0%
industry and a few takeaways so direct
 
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
direct economic output looking at
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
and this is from stump to finished
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
product it's about 1.6 billion dollars a
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
year of economic output that comes from
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
the state's Forest products industry
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
if you look at direct indirect and
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
what's called induced so this is the
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
logger logger in The Sawmill are direct
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
there are people working with the boards
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
working with the saws indirect are the
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
companies that support them the Napa
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
Auto Parts that sell millions of dollars
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
of hydraulic equipment to the loggers
 
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
HMC a sawmill manufacturer that sells
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
lot saw milling equipment to this to The
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
Sawmill if you include those indirect
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then the induced that's the sandwich
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
shop down this down the road that the
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
logger stops or the car dealership that
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
the mill owner visits that starts
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
approaching 2.5 billion
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's the kind of the the
 
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.970 align:start position:0%
and so that's the kind of the the
economic

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
input if you look in the past I haven't
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
seen any recent numbers but within the
 
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:22.460 align:start position:0%
last 10 years if you look at Industries
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
Forest Products is one of the top three
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
um manufacturing sectors of the state
 
01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:33.020 align:start position:0%
um it's it's when you look at
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
all the industries as a whole Forest
 
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
Products is is one of the top three
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and people are surprised to hear that
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
we don't have big factories along the
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
river in Manchester right next to the
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
interstate all our work happens out in
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
the woods and in small rural communities
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
sprinkled throughout the state
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
we have about two dozen commercial
 
01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.230 align:start position:0%
we have about two dozen commercial
sawmills

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
sawmills
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
um these are and there are many many
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
smaller Mills portable Mills things of
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
that nature across the state but we have
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
just over two dozen larger commercial
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
Sawmills that saw all species all
 
01:07:10.619 --> 01:07:12.589 align:start position:0%
Sawmills that saw all species all
products

01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
um in terms of Timber harvesting if you
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
look at the state's Timber tax data one
 
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
of the things we glean from this the
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
timber attacks and and report of cuts
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
and intent to Cuts is we get a very good
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
data set
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
about about two two and a half million
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
tons of wood is harvested every year
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's all products all species so
 
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:36.380 align:start position:0%
that's red maple going into firewood
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
that's eastern white pine going to a
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
sawmill to make uh to make Lumber it's
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
all products all species
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
um we have in terms of logging
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
contractors this number has we have seen
 
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.069 align:start position:0%
contractors this number has we have seen
some

01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh some I'll say uh erosion on this
 
01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:56.579 align:start position:0%
number over the past couple years due to
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
some Market some shifts in markets and
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
loss of some low-grade markets hence the
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
the commission that
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative harb is is is leading up
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
but logging we estimate there's about
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere from This Is Us
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
I'll say a squishy number and it's
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
because we have about I'll say 900 to a
 
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
thousand you know I say it's squishy
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
because I may own a skitter I may cut
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
wood in the winter and then in the
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
summer I say all right I'm going to do
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
some fishing and I have an excavator and
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
I may do some some earth work so am I a
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
logger am I but we estimate that there's
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
about eight anywhere from nine hundred
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
to a thousand logging contractors across
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
um licensed Foresters these are folks
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
that are professional Foresters they're
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
licensed with the state's licensing uh
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
The Joint licensing board they're about
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
two just over 250 licensed Foresters
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
across the state and they provide they
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
provide landowners consultation guidance
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
some of them actually work for Mills in
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
the purchase wood for Mills
 
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
so and then in terms of biomass power
 
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
plants we have
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
we have several that are idle we have
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
two that two that are currently two that
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
are currently operating a large power
 
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
plant up in Berlin that's burning wood
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
chips to make electricity up in Berlin
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
and then a second one in Ashland if you
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
head north on 93 and you go past the
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
Ashland exit if you look to the left
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see a stack that's Bridgewater
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
power some of you visited Bridgewater
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
power this past summer to get a feel for
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
it again important part of the industry
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
because it's a market for low-grade wood
 
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of everything we grow
 
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
in this state is considered low grade
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a function of the trees
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's the nature of our trees it's the
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
species it's how they grow and so
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
markets for that are important if you're
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to practice sustainable forestry
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's like weeding a garden you need to
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
have a place to take these weeds biomass
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
is one paper mills had historically been
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
a very important Market that industry is
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
certainly contracted although I'll say
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
there are Mills in Western Maine that we
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
that a lot of New Hampshire wood goes to
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
and one over in Glens Falls New York
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the
 
01:10:27.649 --> 01:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
kind of the big picture the industry
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
um in your packet and to kind of get
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
into the bill itself house bill 174. I
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's called
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
reported volume by County April 1 2020
 
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
to March 31 2021. this is a document
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.669 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Department of
Revenue

01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.169 align:start position:0%
Revenue
and

01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative bullio Harvey bolio got
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
into this when you file an intent to cut
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
the town receives it
 
01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:02.780 align:start position:0%
hopefully they review it within 15 days
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to address the
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
question of what happens after 15 days
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
if they don't sign it or let you know
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's an issue so
 
01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.229 align:start position:0%
there's an issue so
they

01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
that intent to cut gets signed
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
that tells the town okay there's a
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
Timber sale that's going to occur on
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
this piece of property
 
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
and you can anticipate tax revenue it is
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
a notice of intent to cut
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
some people call them permits some
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
people call them approvals it is a
 
01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
notice putting the town on notice that
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
hey and it's a it's pure tax document
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
this is what's going to happen on this
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
property you can anticipate taxes
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
Town gets that document in in this
 
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
particular tax year there were 2
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
327 Timber sales across the state of New
 
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.850 align:start position:0%
327 Timber sales across the state of New
Hampshire

01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:54.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's almost every town Sees at least
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
one timber sale in the state of New
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire every year and I'll say almost
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
you get on the sea coasts there's not a
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
lot of wood to be cut in some of those
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
communities but Statewide almost every
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
town sees a at least one timber sale
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
so so that intent to cut gets filed I
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
provided you a copy of this document
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
this is the intent intent to cut
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see it is an estimate you you
 
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.530 align:start position:0%
you'll see it is an estimate you you
provide

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
the landowner logger or Forester tells
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
the town all right
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
here's the tax Lot number
 
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
here's the
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
you see that information on the left
 
01:12:40.679 --> 01:12:41.750 align:start position:0%
you see that information on the left
column

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
column
 
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
this is this is kind of identifies where
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to occur
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
um the type of ownership
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
and then on the right column you'll see
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
the table and they provide an estimate
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
these are how an mbf is an abbreviation
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
for board feet
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
um thousand board feet this is an
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
estimate so you say all right we walked
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
the property we think we're going to
 
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
harvest 50 000 board feet of eastern
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
white pine 20 000 board feet of uh
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
of spruce fur or Yellow Birch and one
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
thousand board feet of Oak
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
the the person responsible for the cut
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
that could be the logger that could be
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
the Forester and the landowner signed
 
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.890 align:start position:0%
the Forester and the landowner signed
this

01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
um sometimes there may be joint
 
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.850 align:start position:0%
um sometimes there may be joint
ownership

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
um a husband and wife jointly owned the
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
parcel they would both sign it
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and the the law has Provisions in
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
this that it okay there's a partnership
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
you get the partners to sign it they
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
send it into the town the town receives
 
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
this they have 15 days
 
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.310 align:start position:0%
this they have 15 days
and

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
the second document from dra that I
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
provided is a synopsis of New Hampshire
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
Timber tax law
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the four points on the
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
front of this
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
that representative Harvey bolia
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
had mentioned
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
front page on the bottom
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
did they complete the form properly
 
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:14.300 align:start position:0%
is it an unproductive category
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
what is unproductive what is
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
unproductive land think of a large bog
 
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
our Marsh area an area that just won't
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
produce Wood high elevation where
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's just your above tree line
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
um you know is the land has the
 
01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.550 align:start position:0%
um you know is the land has the
landowner

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
is it unproductive obviously if it's
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
unproductive why would you be harvesting
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
Timber if it's not there so this is a
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
check to make sure okay yeah this is
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
this is legitimate
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
um is a bond required bonds are
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
typically required for typically for two
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
reasons if I if I'm back if I'm if I owe
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
the town taxes already
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
say I'm behind on my taxes I tell the
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
town okay I'm going to cut my wood maybe
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
I'm going to cut my wood to pay the town
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
the town says that's great Jason but we
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if you skip town
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
that there's some surety that we will
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
get that tax revenue they will require a
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
bond the second place where bonds get
 
01:15:21.729 --> 01:15:21.739 align:start position:0%
required is and you'll hear about this
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
from one of the future speakers here the
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
second place is if it's state state or
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
federal land
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um bear Brooks State Park White Mountain
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
National Forest when they do a Timber
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
harvest the logger will complete this
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
this governmental entity owns the land
 
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
but the logger will complete an intent
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
to cut
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
they'll complete an intent to cut for
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
the sale they submitted to the town and
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
they do the they do the timber sale on
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
the state park the reservation State
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
Reservation or the federal land and then
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
they and they build into their bid
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
Timber taxes and they will pay the town
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
a Timber tax so the town still gets
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue even though it's publicly owned
 
01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.270 align:start position:0%
Revenue even though it's publicly owned
land

01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:11.870 align:start position:0%
land
um

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another piece but in
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
that instance
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
the towns well very Mo will typically
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
say look
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
ER you know Chopper Bob you don't own
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
that land that's owned by the state of
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or that's owned by the U.S
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
department of Agriculture we would like
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
to see a bond
 
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
um if there's some mix-up we want to be
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
assured that we will get our our taxes
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so so those are two instances where
 
01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
taxes tax bonds would be required the
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
other two items on the list for for
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
withholding a signature is owners of
 
01:16:51.659 --> 01:16:52.610 align:start position:0%
withholding a signature is owners of
record

01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
husband and wife a uh you know a joint
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
ownership such as a husband and wife
 
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
um Partnerships if they both don't sign
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
it again that can that can be a hold up
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
so yeah so those are the four those are
 
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
the four four reasons
 
01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.689 align:start position:0%
the four four reasons
um

01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
the town and it's right now in law it is
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
illegal for that logger to start
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
harvesting without an intent to cut
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
you just can't you can't start legally
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
you will get a violation there are
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
forest rangers there's a Timber tax
 
01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.169 align:start position:0%
forest rangers there's a Timber tax
assessor

01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
assessor
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
um that will come they'll shut you down
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
you'll get fined it's not a pretty
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
picture so it's really important this
 
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
document is kind of a a gatekeeper to to
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
when you can start that project move
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
your equipment on and start it so having
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
this document
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
signed and approved is really you know
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
getting that approval is is really
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
important if you're going to try to get
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
things get things rolling
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
in towns by law have 15 days
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
and they are calendar days
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
they have 15 days to say yes we sign off
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
on it or
 
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
you missed it one of your owners of
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
record or we want a bond they have 15
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
days to get back to you one of the
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
problems we have is that there are towns
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
and and I don't I I don't want to say
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's always malicious
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
but there are towns that will just not
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
get back to you you submit it it goes to
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
the town clerk the town clerk signs date
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
stamps it says okay I received this on
 
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
on January 18th boom thank you and in
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
many instances I would say two-thirds of
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
the time the the town Clinton
 
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
review the tax cards okay owners of
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
record have signed all the owners of
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
record it's filled out correctly there
 
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
aren't any back taxes and they'll hand
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
it off in in most like I said two-thirds
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the time off to the selectman it goes
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
on the agenda and the selectman will
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
review it and sign it at the next
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
selectman's meeting if and so the
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
question has come up what if the
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
Selectmen don't meet within 15 days
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was contempt that is already
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
contemplated in the law the law says all
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
right if for some reason those Selectmen
 
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
don't meet
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
sorry don't meet in 15 days
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
they can they can put a a 24-hour notice
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
they post a 24-hour notice that an
 
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
intent to cut was received and
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
then after 24 hours notice the Selectmen
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
can sign it in many instances what will
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
happen is it'll go on a stack of papers
 
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
usually invoices and receipts and as the
 
01:19:57.370 --> 01:19:57.380 align:start position:0%
Selectmen cycle through the town office
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
over the next 13 days they'll they'll
 
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
sign it and your everyone's set ready to
 
01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
sign it and your everyone's set ready to
go

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.310 align:start position:0%
go
um

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.990 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
there are instances where we have seen
 
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
across the state an intent to cut
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
will get submitted well
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna sit on this we
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
want we think you need to we need we
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
think you'll need a driveway permit we
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
think there are wetlands out there
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
um we mean the town we would like the
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission to review your
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
intent to cut
 
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.470 align:start position:0%
intent to cut
um

01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
and in those instances I come back to
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
this is a tax document it those issues
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
there are other agencies that deal with
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
that there are other Regulators that are
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
watching that so and and it is
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
that is not a a there are only four
 
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.890 align:start position:0%
that is not a a there are only four
reasons

01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
that a an intent to cut can be held up
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
from signature and so whether you
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
anticipate we want to Road Bond we need
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
a driveway permit we think you should
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
file a Wetlands permit that's irrelevant
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
for this particular document there are
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
other laws in place there are Rangers
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're Des folks out there that
 
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
regulate that this is a separate
 
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
separate entity altogether
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
why 15 days why is this important
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear from a an individual
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
who's in the logging business
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
when you're operating a logging business
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
you'll have a couple million dollars
 
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
worth of capital this isn't just guys
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
with pickup trucks and a chainsaw
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
anymore these are mechanized operations
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
you'll have a couple million dollars in
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
capital you have payroll and so lining
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
up work
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
future work
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
um becomes really important you want to
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
keep your Capital want to keep your
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
Capital operating at the same time you
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
want to keep your Crews busy
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and you line projects up with an
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
expectation that okay in 15 days
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be able to move on to the
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'll I should have I should have the
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
approvals my paperwork was in order I
 
01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
should be able to move on to this lot in
 
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
15 days if that gets hung up
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
if for some reason
 
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
I don't hear back
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
now what do I do it's illegal for me to
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
begin and so I'm stuck I can't move my
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
crew my equipment is idle and there's a
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
there's a financial and operational
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
burden there
 
01:22:36.659 --> 01:22:37.669 align:start position:0%
burden there
um

01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
weather a day like today you get a nice
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
nice warm spell it seems like we get a
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
lot of them these days in January and
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
February I may be on a logging job I
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
have a couple days of rain I have a
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
second job kind of my backup my plan B
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
I've got the intent to cut filed
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
15 days comes and goes we get a couple
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
days on my primary job I say look we got
 
01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
to pull out we don't want to make a mess
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
we don't want to make ruts we want to
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
pull out and move to this higher drier
 
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.350 align:start position:0%
pull out and move to this higher drier
ground

01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
ground
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
if I don't have that approval again I'm
 
01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
stuck so whether also becomes a becomes
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
when we crafted this bill
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
we looked at it and we said all right
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
um we don't
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't in in the attorney that I
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
worked with said well Jason why don't
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
you just say after 15 days it's
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
automatically approved there are other
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory permit programs that do that
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
you could just say you know there you
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
provide your notice and you're just good
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
to go if you don't hear back in 15 days
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
and although as appealing as that was I
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
said look you know this is a tax
 
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
document this is dealing with tax
 
01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.450 align:start position:0%
document this is dealing with tax
records

01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
let's let's provide a safety let's
 
01:23:58.810 --> 01:23:58.820 align:start position:0%
provide a safety catch here or a check
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
where I can start on day 16. after I
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
filed that intent to cut and it's been
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
date stamped I file it I start my
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
operation if at that point the town says
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a typo on your on your
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
document or you know the husband and
 
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
wife they both didn't sign it you need
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
to get that second signature
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
in this in this bill we said all right
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
they notify me and this is to
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative harb's question they
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
provide a notification right now it's
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
it it's it's very uh it's not certified
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
or registered mail and we tried to
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
address that in the bills that they
 
01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
provide a notice the we originally had a
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
letter in there providing a letter but
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
again recall time is of the essence and
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
in I would say 99.999 of the time it's a
 
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
phone call
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
hey hey looked at your intent to cut it
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
looks like you got a typo here your Lot
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
number your Lot number doesn't match up
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
can we can we fix this let's let's Rec
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
let's Rectify this and so what we did
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
was in the bill we said they provide you
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
a note they notify you
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
you cease operations
 
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
you work it out they and then if to
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
their satisfaction they sign it you're
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
you're back you're you're able to run
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
again so we didn't want to just say uh
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
assume they're all assume they're all
 
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
all approved we wanted to try to take a
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
measured approach and not just kind of
 
01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
ram rot it through
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to be punitive
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to come in and say well
 
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
if you don't sign this in 15 days we're
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
going to tag you the town a thousand
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
dollars a day for every day that this
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
isn't signed starting on day 16. we said
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to approach that we work
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
with the towns we wanted to be we wanted
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
to be accommodating but also recognizing
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we have timetables and that we want
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
to be able to to operate and move
 
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
forward and so we didn't want to be
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
punitive and kind of create an
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.689 --> 01:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
and we didn't want to throw extra
 
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
burdens on a town we didn't want to
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
create another bureaucratic process
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
um or add additional burden to towns
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
we're basically saying look day 16 let
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
us start
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
and at that point if you do come back
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
and you see an issue with it notify us
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then at that point
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
we'll take a time out let's fix it and
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
then let's move forward
 
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
in the bill there is the five-day
 
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
provision I wanted to talk about that
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and that is on looking at the
 
01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.910 align:start position:0%
um and that is on looking at the
amendment

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
page one
 
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
lines 23 24.
 
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:03.709 align:start position:0%
lines 23 24.
so

01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
doing my due diligence and preparing
 
01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.189 align:start position:0%
doing my due diligence and preparing
this

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
um and in vetting it with some of the
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
stakeholders dra was amongst them they
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
they didn't the only comments that they
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
provided was
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
we dra will hear regularly from towns
 
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
what does immediately mean it says you
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
immediately so I signed that I send my
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
intent to cut it gets signed
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
copy comes back to me and says Jason
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're good to go
 
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
the town is obligated now to send a copy
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Revenue
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
Administration current law says
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
immediately well he said well what does
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
that mean the selectman meet Tuesday
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
night does it have to be first thing
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
so to try to create to try to create
 
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
some kind of sideboards or guidance dra
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
had suggested five business days
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
I wanted to speak up speak to this
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
because someone would could ask Jason
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
why does the land why do the landowners
 
01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:04.139 align:start position:0%
why are you concerned about this
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
interaction between the depart the town
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
and the department we put this in
 
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
um they had suggested that
 
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
they thought that was an improvement we
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
said fine we'll we'll put it in the bill
 
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and and move forward with it it does
 
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
provide some sideboards
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
um what is immediately that could mean a
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
the other piece is that we tried to
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
create a bill that didn't
 
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
um erode a Town's Authority
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
they'd still have towns still have the
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
ability to say time out
 
01:28:48.169 --> 01:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
Park your equipment we got to work this
 
01:28:48.179 --> 01:28:49.010 align:start position:0%
Park your equipment we got to work this
out

01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to erode a Town's
 
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
Authority but we also wanted to
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that towns have a legal
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
obligation they have 15 days to sign or
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
get back to me
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
so we want to recognize that they have a
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
legal obligation to fulfill but on the
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
other hand we didn't want to erode that
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
Authority so in crafting this bill
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to try to recognize those
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
two key points as well
 
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.470 align:start position:0%
two key points as well
um

01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
if this does it sounds like there may be
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
some ideas about some other parts of it
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
and there may be a suggestion of a
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of some type if there is we
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be happy to participate in in that
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
in that discussion with that I'll
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I thank you for
 
01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
bearing with me in in my forestry Timber
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
harvesting 101 Forest industry but thank
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
you again for the opportunity to speak
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for your attention
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
this this morning
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try and answer any
 
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.330 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try and answer any
questions

01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from Members
 
01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
remember the representative Lamontagne
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned a few times that
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
this has
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
um nothing to do with some issues like
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
conservation or Wetland but um I come
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
from the construction background and I
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
kind of look at this as the building
 
01:30:09.179 --> 01:30:10.310 align:start position:0%
kind of look at this as the building
permit

01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
but you don't get the building permit
 
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
until you've made sure that
 
01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
other concerns that going through
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
planning or Conservation Commission have
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
been met and I'm wondering why there
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
isn't a sign off on this that that's
 
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
done in advance to make sure those
 
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
issues aren't
 
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.110 align:start position:0%
issues aren't
um

01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:31.729 --> 01:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
that if they need to be addressed
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're not already addressed
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
so good good question so this unlike a
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
building permit where you need to ensure
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
that you have your other ducks in a row
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
and your other approvals in place this
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
is this is quite simply a notice of
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
intent it's not it is not a a permit in
 
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
the sense that
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's not tied to other other
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
activities or other approvals that may
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
be out there
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
um it is purely a tax document we would
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
not support tying this to Wetlands
 
01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:11.900 align:start position:0%
permits you know having this having
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
approval of this
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
um linked to Wetlands permits or
 
01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.370 align:start position:0%
um linked to Wetlands permits or
um

01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
I can't think of uh you know Road
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
bonding or driveway permits it's just
 
01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
we would not we could not support that
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
it is we like it as purely a tax
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
document we're providing a notice you
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
town can anticipate taxes
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I answered your question
 
01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:43.940 align:start position:0%
it's not a but I I guess the the the
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
trick is try if you can try not to think
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
of it as a permit but as a notification
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of similarities in
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
the construction world and I I can't I
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
can't come up with any parallels but
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
for another question
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted a follow-up question
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
but it does seem to me that this is the
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
last thing that has to be signed before
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
the work can begin
 
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
the work can begin
so

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
not exactly and what I mean by that is
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
if if I have a project if I'm going to
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
cut timber
 
01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
say I'm on a very high and dry site
 
01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
there are no Wetlands on the site
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
then this this is I submit this
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I do my Timber Harvest 15 days comes
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
and goes I do my Timber Harvest if there
 
01:32:47.570 --> 01:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
are wetlands Crossings on that site
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
and I have to obtain a Wetlands permit
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
and this can this this is not uncommon I
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
may have a hundred acres the first 50
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
acres are high and dry the back 50 there
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
are some Wetlands Crossings maybe
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's a brook that runs through there
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
and we need to cross it
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
in that instance I can file my intent to
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
cut I can harvest my start working give
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
and then the landowner says you know
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
what while you're here let's let's let's
 
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
do that forestry silvicultural treatment
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
on the back 50. all right we need to
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
First file a Wetlands permit with the
 
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
of course they had
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
at that point then a notice goes to the
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
forest rangers and they know all right
 
01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
there's a Wetlands Crossing when I go
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
out and inspect that job
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm going to look for
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
is that but this is the web the types of
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
permits that a forestry job would obtain
 
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
differ site by site to sit so to tie
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
this to all all approvals may not be
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate because I may have a job
 
01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:57.890 align:start position:0%
appropriate because I may have a job
where

01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
I don't need a Wetlands permit nor a
 
01:34:03.649 --> 01:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
driveway permit or I may get into it
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
and the landowner decides something down
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
the road now I need it but I'm because
 
01:34:14.570 --> 01:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative rung then representative
 
01:34:21.659 --> 01:34:23.629 align:start position:0%
representative rung then representative
Derby

01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
Derby
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
the way I'm understanding this bill the
 
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
amendment is so that the process moves
 
01:34:37.209 --> 01:34:37.219 align:start position:0%
along and loggers aren't
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
prevented from moving forward on their
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
project because of inaction on the part
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
of the town is that is that a true
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
statement correct but when I was looking
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
through this document that you handed
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
out from the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:53.780 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration
 
01:34:58.129 --> 01:34:58.139 align:start position:0%
in the bottom part
 
01:34:58.139 --> 01:34:59.450 align:start position:0%
in the bottom part
um

01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:02.770 --> 01:35:02.780 align:start position:0%
there was something oh it's uh
 
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
in the last page
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh I mean the last paragraph of the
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
first page it says if the municipal
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
officials have not acted on the notice
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
to intend to cut within 15 days of
 
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
receipt the landowner should contact dra
 
01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
who will inquire with the town as the
 
01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
status and then the town has 15 days
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
so doesn't that resolve the issue of the
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
Town not responding to the notice of
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
intent to cut
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
um many times it will but we have had
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
instances where they say
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input we still want
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
to look at this or we still want to do
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
whatever before we sign that not that's
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
not common but we have had a couple
 
01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:52.139 align:start position:0%
instances where that's that has occurred
 
01:35:52.139 --> 01:35:54.530 align:start position:0%
instances where that's that has occurred
so

01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that the the
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
logger could notify dra say we haven't
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
gotten a response yet from the town now
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
the town has 15 days to respond and
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying they don't do that or in
 
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
their response they just say we're still
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
holding on to it but did they just not
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
respond to the dra
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know about their
 
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
Communications with dra what we have
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
seen is I file an intent to cut 15 days
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
comes and goes I call dra up and say hey
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
Town X I haven't heard back from them
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
um can you give them a call dra will
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
call them and almost you know most of
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
the time they will the town will say all
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
right yeah you know dra will it's kind
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
of the the heavy hand of of state
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
government but there have been instances
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
where towns have just said we're busy
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
we'll get to it when we get to it
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't start the 15-day clock over
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
they still have 15 days from when that
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
gets date stamped when that town clerk
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
gets that document and date stamps it by
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
law they still have 15 days to act on it
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
calling dra on day 15 does not start a
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
second 15-day clock
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative Darby for a question
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have two very short
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions hopefully
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
um the first is you you mentioned a
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
couple of the
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
um reasons why that the tax Bond might
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
be recorded but I was under the
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
impression reading RSA 793 AI there was
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
another case which is when the property
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
owner the signer does is not actually a
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
property owner in the town meaning that
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
they are you know maybe they live out of
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
state and they just retained and that's
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
actually one of the check marks on the
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
form you know they retained property
 
01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
rights so is there a case where you know
 
01:37:58.850 --> 01:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
the town might have to do some research
 
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
on the deed
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
um to in order to be able to determine
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
if a bond is required
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
great great question generally not
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
generally it's a pretty quick check they
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
can look at the tax card and say all
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
right here are the owners of record they
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't need to go in and do deed research
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
on it there'll be the tax card will be
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty cut and dry here here's
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
who owns that parcel
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
and here's who they send him a tax bill
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
annually so they usually have pretty
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
current information just to make sure I
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying that the tax
 
01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
card would include who owns the timber
 
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.030 align:start position:0%
card would include who owns the timber
rights

01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
terms of Timber rights if you purchase
 
01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
if you separate the timber rights that
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
may be doesn't happen a lot but it can
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
happen I don't I don't know how that if
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
that does if that is reflected on the
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
the tax card or not I don't know on a
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
Timber rights issue again I'm not real
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen a lot that's fine I
 
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
understand things my other question is
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
um following up on uh represent
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative montane's question for
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
the second question oh I'm sorry yep
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:39:15.719 --> 01:39:17.209 align:start position:0%
um is
um

01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is a tax uh this
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
is a tax document I get that and I
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
unders um but this tax document seems to
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
be the um momentum that generates the
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
environmental reviews by
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
um Des
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
um and there's a couple of cases I guess
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
and so as I as I read through you know
 
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
the the amendment and the original or I
 
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:38.510 align:start position:0%
the the amendment and the original or I
say

01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
um the the tax bill goes to the tax
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
administration they have to forward it
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
so that and that actually gives DS the
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
right to actually go on the property and
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
make and ensure that it is being
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
um that for example the Wetland laws are
 
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.570 align:start position:0%
um that for example the Wetland laws are
being

01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
um uh applied so again I'm my concern
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
here and I'm hoping you can comment on
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
um the you know if it's not signed if
 
01:40:07.610 --> 01:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
because it's then it's the signing that
 
01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
basically initiates this process
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
The Cutting may be virtually done before
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
or completely done before the
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
um before the tax Authority gets it and
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
they afford it over Des
 
01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.410 align:start position:0%
they afford it over Des
I

01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
to say that the cutting would be done I
 
01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
mean they've had 15 day they've had this
 
01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:37.139 align:start position:0%
document for 15 days that the town has
 
01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
before I can even begin to move on it so
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
no cutting has occurred in that period
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
you would hope that they would not sit
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
much beyond that but
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know I don't think there's
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
the risk that you're going to have
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
they finally get her in my hope can
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
can't say anything's for certain but I
 
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
can't see a scenario where you would
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
have a situation where the cut totally
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
happens before the town gets around
 
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:15.380 align:start position:0%
designing this they should have already
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
reviewed it and signed it in the initial
 
01:41:20.689 --> 01:41:20.699 align:start position:0%
15 days when nothing is happening if a
 
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
town is that
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
there may be something else going on
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
there the town is that far behind in
 
01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
processing these things
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
where I go before we go on uh chair as
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
seen as feels that we may probably
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
leaning toward a work uh a work session
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill a
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
that that's be aware be aware of that
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
we'll I'll we'll talk about that uh at a
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
later date
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr stock for taking the
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
question and for bringing the bill to
 
01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
help expedite some of these small
 
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire getting
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
their work done um
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
quick question I know we're a little
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
um what's the replantation or
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
reforestation requirement either
 
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
federally or in New Hampshire on on
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
private or private land it's a great
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
question we we do not require replanting
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
and if you talk to a Forester
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
we have a problem controlling growth
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
unlike western western Forest where
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
replanting is a regular part of
 
01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.229 align:start position:0%
replanting is a regular part of
operations

01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:43.550 align:start position:0%
operations
here

01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
many of the hardwoods you cut a tree
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
they will stump Sprout and if there's a
 
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
deer hunter in the group they will know
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
find areas that had find a three
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
four-year-old clear-cut or patch cut and
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of stump Sprouts so one
 
01:43:00.169 --> 01:43:00.179 align:start position:0%
of the challenges we have is managing
 
01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:03.179 align:start position:0%
growth and replanting unless it's like a
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree farm or something like
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we have the we're very very
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
fortunate to not have to replant
 
01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.070 align:start position:0%
fortunate to not have to replant
yeah

01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
education any other questions from
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
if seeing none thank you very much we've
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
um just briefly we are a voluntary
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
membership organization that currently
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
comprises all 234 cities and towns
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
we provide legal advice to cities in
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
town so if you are a local official
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
you've probably caught our Legal Hotline
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
or familiar with it we do training
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
education for municipalities we did
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
about 80 events last year
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
um among the four people who do training
 
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and we also come here and advocate
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
um we are opposed to this legislation
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I recognize I'm probably the odd man
 
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:15.659 align:start position:0%
out here certainly if the inclination of
 
01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:17.219 align:start position:0%
the committee is to have a subcommittee
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to participate
 
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
um I believe that uh representative
 
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne kind of Hit Upon Our our main
 
01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:27.410 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne kind of Hit Upon Our our main
objection

01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
um here which is that we do Advocate to
 
01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:32.330 align:start position:0%
um here which is that we do Advocate to
maintain

01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
um local control
 
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and we recognize certainly that if
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
there is an intent to cut filed a 15-day
 
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
period lapses and it's not signed off on
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
the logger doesn't get any communication
 
01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:45.609 align:start position:0%
the logger doesn't get any communication
from

01:44:45.609 --> 01:44:45.619 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
the municipality that is problematic for
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
everyone and we would like to work
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
towards finding a solution on that
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
um as representative rung noted um in
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
the in the dra
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
um or one of the documents that was
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
provided by Mr stock
 
01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.290 align:start position:0%
provided by Mr stock
um

01:45:05.290 --> 01:45:05.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
generally the process right now is if
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
they don't hear back from municipality
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
you would call dra dra would out have
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of Outreach with
 
01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
um the municipality and attempt to
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
resolve the issue
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
um that seems to be a appropriate
 
01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.810 align:start position:0%
um that seems to be a appropriate
approach

01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
um simply because dra is the one who
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
regulates taxation they're the ones who
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
would who would seem to be the
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate regulator
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't want to be in a situation
 
01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:31.729 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't want to be in a situation
where

01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:45:31.739 --> 01:45:32.930 align:start position:0%
where
um

01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
loggers are cutting without any input
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
from the municipality because
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
we would have those concerns
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think Mr stock did a great
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
explanation about the whole process and
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
the different slides but some of our
 
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
members are concerned about about those
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
those other agencies and groups and
 
01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
their input into the process and making
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
sure all the appropriate regulatory
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
authorities are notified
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
um when when they
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
become aware of situations because of
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
course select ports are in charge of
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
making sure their whole town runs so
 
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
they're not just in charge of
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
a very narrow area whether taxation or
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
anything else but they also
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
really do have to try to coordinate all
 
01:46:24.169 --> 01:46:24.179 align:start position:0%
the various local boards and help
 
01:46:26.290 --> 01:46:26.300 align:start position:0%
everyone Row in the same direction
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the input that we heard from
 
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
our members when we reached out to them
 
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
on this and I'll keep my testimony to
 
01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:35.450 align:start position:0%
on this and I'll keep my testimony to
that

01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not happy to answer any questions
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.129 align:start position:0%
any questions
Mr

01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.139 --> 01:46:44.629 align:start position:0%
 
Q

01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
Q
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
can you tell us how often they can't get
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
it done in 15 days and why
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is it really breaks
 
01:46:59.209 --> 01:46:59.219 align:start position:0%
down to two different areas one is you
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
have someone new on staff who's the
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
admin person or whatever comes in the
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
logger comes in
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
hands in the form and they don't
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
understand they're supposed to do
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
something within 15 days and that is
 
01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
usually quickly corrected the other one
 
01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.450 align:start position:0%
usually quickly corrected the other one
is

01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:15.590 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:18.010 --> 01:47:18.020 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities who do a little bit more
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
in-depth Research into into the whole
 
01:47:24.719 --> 01:47:25.850 align:start position:0%
in-depth Research into into the whole
process

01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and so they end up exceeding the 15
 
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:29.209 align:start position:0%
um and so they end up exceeding the 15
days

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:47:29.219 --> 01:47:30.050 align:start position:0%
days
um

01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
I understand that's a small number of
 
01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities I don't have an exact
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
number that's not something we'd survey
 
01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.870 align:start position:0%
number that's not something we'd survey
but

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
it is something that obviously should be
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
addressed because we all recognize that
 
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
the timber industry is very important
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
economically and is a is a major driver
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
of revenue for municipalities
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
so we want everyone to comply with the
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
law we understand it's 15 days we just
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
think that there's a better solution
 
01:47:59.689 --> 01:47:59.699 align:start position:0%
than than allowing
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
um loggers to begin to cut and we're
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
happy to work on a coming to a
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
collective Solution on that
 
01:48:12.649 --> 01:48:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else on the committee
 
01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:20.270 align:start position:0%

Mr Sharp
 
01:48:32.699 --> 01:48:34.609 align:start position:0%
Mr Sharp
um

01:48:34.609 --> 01:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
Bristol and
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the time
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm a logger fifth generation out of
 
01:48:46.209 --> 01:48:46.219 align:start position:0%
Grafton County
 
01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
this of course I support this bill
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
this is not an issue until it's an issue
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
um nine times out of ten
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
everything goes through fairly
 
01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.570 align:start position:0%
everything goes through fairly
seamlessly

01:48:59.570 --> 01:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
seamlessly
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
I can give you a couple stories
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
please I do please don't oh no just a
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
story on how how it affects us it cost
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
me about four thousand dollars to move
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
one crew let alone multiple Crews
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're on time sensitive jobs
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
when I'm working for the federal
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
government or especially the state of
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which I think I'm the
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
largest logger last year for the state
 
01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
we have these towns
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's a the medium-sized hounds are the
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
problem the small towns they're great
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
take care of us wonderful even if they
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
don't know me
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
the medium-sized towns are the seem to
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
be the issue
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
I had to post a Timber tax Bond I do all
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
my paperwork correctly I get it in I
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
send one of my gentlemen down with the
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
check to post the bond
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
they sit on it and they sit on it and
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
they sit on it what they did not do is
 
01:50:00.590 --> 01:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't sit on my check for almost
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars they cash that
 
01:50:04.129 --> 01:50:04.139 align:start position:0%
in two days
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
you're able to take care of that part of
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
the paperwork
 
01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
a problem when weather hits us
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
as we only work about 40 weeks out of
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
the year and I try to make payroll for
 
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.729 align:start position:0%
the year and I try to make payroll for
52.

01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
52.
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
it just is a small
 
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
issue and it's the law if they can just
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
do as what is in the books and it's
 
01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.350 align:start position:0%
do as what is in the books and it's
usually

01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
they don't like something but it's not
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
one of the rules to kick it out so then
 
01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating for myself to get a
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
hold of dra and they rattle the cage and
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
then we get it signed
 
01:50:45.649 --> 01:50:45.659 align:start position:0%
and sometimes well we don't meet again
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
well now it's 20 days
 
01:50:51.410 --> 01:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
that's a problem
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
but it's again
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that's easily addressed
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
because it's a notice and they have no
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
problem grabbing the tax yet last year I
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
paid out myself one operator
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
two million dollars in stumpage to
 
01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
landowners which represents two hundred
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in Timber tax to these
 
01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.070 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in Timber tax to these
towns

01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
you know I know small towns like the
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
town I live in they love the timber
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.129 --> 01:51:25.139 align:start position:0%
do I have any questions
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'll ask to do any questions from
 
01:51:30.649 --> 01:51:30.659 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
uh representative Darby that we're
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
followed by representative wolf
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:38.219 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm hoping you can
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
just briefly walk me through a typical
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
scenario working with a landowner to um
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
from the time that they contact you the
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
timeline in particular wondering about
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
the timeline from the time they contact
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
you to the time that you you know go
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
walk the property to determine you know
 
01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
the cottage uh to the time that uh you
 
01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
submit the form
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh first initial meet could be anywhere
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
is from three months out
 
01:52:03.609 --> 01:52:03.619 align:start position:0%
to a year out
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
when it's a year out or three months out
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem it's when we have the
 
01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
time sensitive
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
we do the forms we send them in
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
everything comes in plenty early sitting
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
in my file I have plenty of time to get
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
there it's when we have a weather change
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I go oh
 
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Jones said it's okay to as soon as
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
you can get to it Mike use it as filling
 
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
we have weather like this boom because
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
in in our in our intent to catch like
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
this time of year I have work all lined
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
up for April well I don't want to send
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
them in and file them now because it's a
 
01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:39.890 align:start position:0%
them in and file them now because it's a
new

01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
tax year April 1st is the fiscal year
 
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
for intent to cuts
 
01:52:48.169 --> 01:52:48.179 align:start position:0%
so you want to send them in now I've
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
done this before and they come back oh
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
you're going to intend to cut for the
 
01:52:55.729 --> 01:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
22-23 season no I need it for 23.24 so
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
that starts the process again
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
I hope that answered your question
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wolf the question
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
if we have just a few towns and it
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
sounds like there are a few outliers not
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
a large number
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to just
 
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
I guess I wouldn't know that answer the
 
01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we just want to go to
 
01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:26.810 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we just want to go to
work

01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
and I understand that too before you
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry
 
01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
if you want to have a question
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about things such as
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
roads being posted in that no sir no I'm
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
talking about them not signing the
 
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
intent to cut or just trying to jam us
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
up time wise and there is a couple towns
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
out there that they are anti-logging
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
almost and they do anything they can to
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
just slow down the process
 
01:54:02.689 --> 01:54:02.699 align:start position:0%
and dra has had I mean I'm on speed dial
 
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
with dra for some of these issues
 
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
because if they will not listen to us as
 
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
a logger but when dra tells them it is
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
State statue you have to do this well it
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
did answer your question yeah thanks I'm
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else
 
01:54:31.570 --> 01:54:31.580 align:start position:0%

Bureau correct thank you Mr chair

director New Hampshire Farm Bureau is
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
the Federation of New Hampshire's 10
 
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
County Farm Bureau organizations and we
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
we rep the total we represent a total of
 
01:55:02.209 --> 01:55:02.219 align:start position:0%
about 3 000 member families about 1800
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
of those are farmer members in the
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
remaining 1200 or so are are supporting
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
members rural families like that and
 
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
we're we're very much in support of the
 
01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
we're we're very much in support of the
bill

01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
many of uh of our of landowners have
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
Woodland that they they manage and
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
depend on for for income and you know
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
it's not like a normal agricultural
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
yearly crop where it's more of a crop
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's every decade or so and it's often
 
01:55:33.649 --> 01:55:33.659 align:start position:0%
time for a larger purchase to to buy
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
land buy a home uh make a large
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
Improvement on a home or in the case of
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
any Farm businesses that are down year
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
you go to your your Woodland to try to
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
make up that difference and uh we we see
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
the the bill it as really providing some
 
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
teeth to the current statute
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
um that's that's that 15 uh daily choir
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
man but there's there are any
 
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.590 align:start position:0%
man but there's there are any
consequences

01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know we feel as landowners that well
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
I've held up my end of the bar again by
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
filing the intent to cut the notice now
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's the responsibility of the Town Tool
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
let me know within 15 days that's one
 
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
and the the second benefit is that it
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
will it will help educate local
 
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
officials and we all know that they
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
change all the time but if officials
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
know this consequences when somebody
 
01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
points out look if we don't get this
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
taken care of and within 15 days get
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
back to that landowner then they can go
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
they can start so it kind of gives I
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
guess you'd say a little bit kick in the
 
01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
pants to to move things along and I just
 
01:56:33.169 --> 01:56:33.179 align:start position:0%
want to stress in closing that again it
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
is it's been said many times this is a
 
01:56:35.639 --> 01:56:36.590 align:start position:0%
is it's been said many times this is a
notice

01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
simply a notice and there's there's four
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
criteria once they're filled it should
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
be signed and provided to the landowner
 
01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay I'll leave it at that and thank you
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
for your time and attention
 
01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:56:51.119 --> 01:56:54.709 align:start position:0%
seeing none
uh

01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:05.290 --> 01:57:05.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.209 --> 01:57:08.219 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chair uh I'm
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
Matt Leahy I'm the public policy
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
director for the society for the
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
protection of New Hampshire Forest we
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
support this bill and largely for the
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
reasons you've already heard so I won't
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
repeat them here I understand there may
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
be a work
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
community on this and we would support
 
01:57:28.430 --> 01:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
that too that is fine I just wanted to
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
take very briefly
 
01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
um just kind of give you a little a
 
01:57:35.689 --> 01:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
sense of you know our interest in this
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
um the four Society we call it for short
 
01:57:42.649 --> 01:57:42.659 align:start position:0%
is a private non-profit Statewide Land
 
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
Trust which means we protect and
 
01:57:48.129 --> 01:57:48.139 align:start position:0%
preserve land we were founded back in
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
1901 so we've been around a long time
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
and we own
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 000 acres in New
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire spread out over 191 different
 
01:58:02.689 --> 01:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
Forest reservations all over New
 
01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and every County here in the
 
01:58:05.219 --> 01:58:05.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and every County here in the
state

01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:09.659 align:start position:0%
um and part of or really our
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
main reason why we own land and why we
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
protect land is to
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
help you know improve the Forest Health
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
the forest strength of you know here in
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
um so and as part of that honestly we do
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
Harvest Timber from time to time we do
 
01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know we're not a major Harvester but
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
we do you know maybe six to ten Harvest
 
01:58:35.530 --> 01:58:35.540 align:start position:0%
a year so but it is part of our strategy
 
01:58:39.649 --> 01:58:39.659 align:start position:0%
to improve the health of our forest in
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
this course as you've heard there's a
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
whole range of benefits they provide so
 
01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
you know the bottom line for us is you
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
know we want to keep forces for us but
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
in actuality you know doing Harvest very
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
smart sustainable Harvest
 
01:58:57.169 --> 01:58:57.179 align:start position:0%
you know does improve the Forest Health
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
and that's really
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
um you know our interests when we talk
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
about Timber harvesting but we do
 
01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
give me any questions by members of the
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
committee seeing not oh representative
 
01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:15.229 align:start position:0%
committee seeing not oh representative
Lamontagne

01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
Lamontagne
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
it seems that an organization like yours
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
would spend really years having a
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
forestry plan to decide what areas you
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
are going to harvest
 
01:59:31.609 --> 01:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
and I think that's
 
01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
um what I'm
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
my difficulty with the whole process is
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
that the tax form I understand having
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
getting that last step be done with
 
01:59:47.209 --> 01:59:47.219 align:start position:0%
expediency to help the logger
 
01:59:47.219 --> 01:59:48.589 align:start position:0%
expediency to help the logger
but

01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:51.070 --> 01:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
if some of the concerns that come up
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
with the towns have to do with the
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
overall bars to plan to protect the
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
health of the forest to protect the
 
02:00:03.649 --> 02:00:03.659 align:start position:0%
Watershed that there should be some
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
other process that's done way in advance
 
02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:09.350 align:start position:0%
other process that's done way in advance
and

02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm just I don't see how this is all
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
going to tie in like that we should have
 
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
this final step
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
um be just the last check box and it
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
should be quick if everything else is
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
done ahead of time
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
yeah so well thanks for the question
 
02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:27.649 align:start position:0%
yeah so well thanks for the question
um

02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:27.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll try not to give along with the
 
02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
and I'll try not to give along with the
answer

02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
um but just speaking for the four
 
02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
Society you know we it can take years
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
for us to decide whether to do a Harvest
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
on any one of our properties and it's
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's a very lengthy we actually have
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
Forest management plans for every one of
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
our reservations but you know if but you
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
know when we do reach that point
 
02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
um whether or not we're going to do a
 
02:00:56.530 --> 02:00:56.540 align:start position:0%
harvest I mean there are other
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
steps we have to go through you know you
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
know besides filing the intent to cut
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
notice I mean oftentimes there may be
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
Des permits we have to get those are all
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know if there's going to be a
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
Wetlands Crossing whatever so there's
 
02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
I mean again the intent to cut you know
 
02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:15.950 align:start position:0%
I mean again the intent to cut you know
is

02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
it was one part of it but there's an
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
awful lot that's already going on
 
02:01:22.729 --> 02:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
um not just at the foresighted but many
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
other Forest land owners you know to to
 
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that what they're doing is is
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
being correctly safely smartly done and
 
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:35.089 align:start position:0%
I think
um

02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
and again you know the the intent to cut
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's just it is the you know I'm not
 
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
gonna say it's the last step but it is
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's filed when we the
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
four side have already done all this
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.239 --> 02:01:53.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I will
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh sir Noah Edition uh seeing no uh
 
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
other pink cards
 
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay well no one else wishes to speak I
 
02:02:17.649 --> 02:02:17.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.659 --> 02:02:19.189 align:start position:0%
 
174.

02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
174.
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
and I will open the hearing on 194
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
requiring the director of the division
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
of archives and Records management to
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
compile and maintain a list of public
 
02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.089 align:start position:0%
compile and maintain a list of public
monuments

02:02:35.089 --> 02:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
is it representative germanna the the
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
Laura is yours thank you Mr chair thank

02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
committee received the amendment that uh
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
should have been sent over by OLS
 
02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:00.470 align:start position:0%
should have been sent over by OLS
yesterday

02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
they informed me uh that they were going
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
to do that hi
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I am not aware of anything all right
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
well it's a it's a simple Amendment I'll

make sure that you get it basically uh
 
02:03:19.070 --> 02:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment is to change the
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
state agency

compiling the list of public monuments
 
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
that I'm proposing from the records in
 
02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
archive archives and Records to the
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
um Department of Natural and cultural
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
resources specifically the division of
 
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
historical resources and the director
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
um of that division Ben Wilson told me
 
02:03:45.649 --> 02:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
that he would be emailing the chair
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
because he was unable to be here this
 
02:03:51.169 --> 02:03:51.179 align:start position:0%
morning yes he he did I do have his uh
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
his memo which I will read into the
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
record after you've introduced The Bill
 
02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh so I am
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
um both a freshman representative uh and
 
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
also a historian and an educator and a
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
professor of history at Keene State
 
02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.070 align:start position:0%
professor of history at Keene State
uh

02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
and I introduced this bill because uh I
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
was thinking about how we could use
 
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
public monuments for educational
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
purposes this is something that I have a
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
particular kind of interested in I am
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
primarily uh well I am a German
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
historian I spent a lot of time in
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
Germany uh and in Germany uh public
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
monuments are used largely for
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
educational purposes of course they had
 
02:04:40.609 --> 02:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
to rebuild so many monuments over the
 
02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
past several decades since so many were
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
destroyed uh in World War II uh but they
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
are there to serve a particular purpose
 
02:04:51.410 --> 02:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
which is educational right to engage
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
people right so it's not simply about
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
walking by something but to see what it
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
represents and into have some
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
educational function and so I was
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
thinking then
 
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
that it would be great if we had one
 
02:05:08.570 --> 02:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
place on a State website for example
 
02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
where we could find a compilation of all
 
02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:15.179 align:start position:0%
of the public monuments in in the state
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right particularly for
 
02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
educators I have a lot of friends who
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
are Educators uh and the idea that you
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
could do a class part of your New
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire educational
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
section in a class unit or some other
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
type of unit perhaps where you had
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
middle school children picking out two
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
or three public monuments in your county
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
right to go out and to look at and to
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
report on as a great way to engage
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh School teachers and children in
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
particular with the study of the history
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.609 --> 02:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
I think that a lot can be gained by kind
 
02:05:56.930 --> 02:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
of seeing
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
all of the ways in which we honor uh
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and groups of individuals
 
02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:03.659 align:start position:0%
and great events in the state I think
 
02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
that having one list gives us the
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see who's represented all
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
across our state who isn't represented
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
and to have discussions about perhaps
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
who should be right and and how they're
 
02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
represented so I introduced this bill
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
being very new I made a mistake I wasn't
 
02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't know which department uh it
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
should go to I'm a historian so I
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
thought about the archives archives keep
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
these kinds of Records but I had a great
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
conversation with representative rung uh
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
and then I reached out to the Secretary
 
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
of State's office and spoke with the
 
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state who advised me
 
02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
then to speak to the folks at the
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.370 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
resources

02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
which I did I've been working with the
 
02:06:54.169 --> 02:06:54.179 align:start position:0%
director of the division of historical
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
resources Ben Wilson
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
to craft the language for an amendment
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
that would would move this from archives
 
02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
and Records to uh to his division uh and
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
he assures me that they have the
 
02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
resources already to be able to do this
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
it would it would involve having
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
somebody who already Works in that
 
02:07:13.139 --> 02:07:14.870 align:start position:0%
somebody who already Works in that
division

02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
division
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
work with local historical societies and
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
other organizations within communities
 
02:07:22.129 --> 02:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
around the state to compile lists which
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
largely would come in from those local
 
02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:25.689 align:start position:0%
largely would come in from those local
organizations

02:07:25.689 --> 02:07:25.699 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that was the the reason why I
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh proposed the bill in the first place
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
think about how we could use public
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
monuments to create a richer discussion
 
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
about our state's history particularly
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
among school children but ideally for
 
02:07:42.169 --> 02:07:42.179 align:start position:0%
all of us and the reason for the
 
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
amendment is because
 
02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
in my uh in my greenness I was not clear
 
02:07:50.209 --> 02:07:50.219 align:start position:0%
about which state department you know
 
02:07:51.649 --> 02:07:51.659 align:start position:0%
Department within the state would be
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
best to handle
 
02:07:56.450 --> 02:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
this project so I think that's a brief
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
outline and I'm very happy to take
 
02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
02:08:05.159 --> 02:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.410 --> 02:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative haribolia
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for taking my
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
question so
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
it says fiscal note but you said that it
 
02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
won't require any extra costs is that
 
02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
correct thank you yes that is that is
 
02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:26.770 align:start position:0%
correct thank you yes that is that is
correct

02:08:26.770 --> 02:08:26.780 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:08:29.330 --> 02:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
director Wilson in our conversations
 
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
told me that it would not incur any
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
extra cost so when the amendment comes
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward and I apologize that you don't
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
have it today I was told that that it
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
would be ready for today but you'll see
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
that there is not a physical note
 
02:08:39.599 --> 02:08:42.109 align:start position:0%
that there is not a physical note
attached

02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
attached
 
02:08:42.119 --> 02:08:44.089 align:start position:0%
attached
yeah

02:08:44.089 --> 02:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah we normally we do get uh
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
we do get the amendment but uh
 
02:08:53.089 --> 02:08:53.099 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
says so there's no other no one else
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
speak out speaking Noel no one else uh
 
02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:01.080 align:start position:0%

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:02.270 align:start position:0%
no questions

I should be able to as my name like a
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
renzullo I should be able to test to

pronounce that a little bit better thank
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I appreciate that and
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee I'm
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Petrino from
 
02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:22.619 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 43 the town of Milford uh
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
prior to my arrival here as a
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative I was a high school
 
02:11:28.729 --> 02:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
social studies teacher and department
 
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
chair for many years my students
 
02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
participated in National History Day
 
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's not one day but a yale-long study
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
on the pot of high school and middle
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
school students
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on a theme
 
02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
creating a Project based on intense
 
02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
research and critical analysis
 
02:11:53.209 --> 02:11:53.219 align:start position:0%
and as such when their projects are
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
completed they compete with other high
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
schools throughout the state of New
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at Plymouth State University
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
the winners then go on to the University
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
of Maryland and the Smithsonian American
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
History Museum where they compete with
 
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
students from all across the country
 
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to say that my students have
 
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
done well in the past but they are at a
 
02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
disadvantage when they compete against
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
students from large states that also
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
have greater resources at their disposal
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to speak in support of 194
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
because I believe it will be just one
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
more tool that our students can use when
 
02:12:36.070 --> 02:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
they compete in this wonderful program
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's it and I'm happy to take any
 
02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.609 align:start position:0%
that's it and I'm happy to take any
questions

02:12:40.609 --> 02:12:40.619 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
 
02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:44.750 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
committee

02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Petrino thank
 
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:59.709 --> 02:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
okay seeing is
 
02:13:01.729 --> 02:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
seeing no other
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh no other pink cards
 
02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:06.649 align:start position:0%
uh no other pink cards
uh

02:13:06.649 --> 02:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
we'll close the hearing on House Bill
 
02:13:15.709 --> 02:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
1 141 relative to dogs on hiking trails
 
02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
and state parks
 
02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:24.770 align:start position:0%
and state parks
uh

02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.649 --> 02:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
02:13:38.689 --> 02:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
um we try to make this brief because I
 
02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
know we're running a little late here
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
but uh this is a bill that basically has
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
three parts to it uh three reasons for
 
02:13:48.410 --> 02:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
it common sense safety and I'll also
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
address enforcement uh just as a brief
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
way of background so you'll have some
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
idea that I do have some idea of what
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about on this I've been
 
02:13:57.890 --> 02:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
hiking in New Hampshire for probably
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
about 40 years about 12 15 or so of
 
02:14:03.649 --> 02:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
those anyways I've been accompanied by a
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
dog in that 40 Years of hiking I have
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
never run into a problem with the dog
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
being off a leash uh and like I say
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's hundreds and hundreds of hikes I
 
02:14:16.609 --> 02:14:16.619 align:start position:0%
was a trip leader for the YMCA Alpine
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
club for 15 years and led hikes for them
 
02:14:22.129 --> 02:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
I never run into people who have said oh
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
we had a real problem last week because
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
there was a dog off of a leash on a
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
hiking trail so the best I can tell is
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's a problem it doesn't exist and
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
so you don't think that's simply my
 
02:14:35.569 --> 02:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
opinion all back that up with something
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
else two major things the largest area
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
of hiking trails in New Hampshire of
 
02:14:41.569 --> 02:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
course is the White Mountains National
 
02:14:44.209 --> 02:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
Forest they get visited by I think the
 
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
amounts at least in the hundreds of
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
thousands of people uh every year
 
02:14:51.290 --> 02:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
their policy is dogs are not allowed on
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
leash not required to be on leashes
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
except in a few very select special
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
areas that see large degree of travel
 
02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
one I think is like Dana's baths in
 
02:15:04.609 --> 02:15:04.619 align:start position:0%
Conway off of West Side Road you'll see
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
that in July and August because it's
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
literally Bumper to Bumper people
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
walking on that but that's the very much
 
02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
the exception not the rule so the over
 
02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
almost I would say 99 plus of the White
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
Mountains National Forest if you're on a
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
hiking trail you don't need to have your
 
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
dog on a leash it has to be under your
 
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
control another very large area used and
 
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
I'll just read from the publication here
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
for a second and see Belknap range in
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is an extensive
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
hiking range that deals in the middle of
 
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
the state it runs from Mount Major over
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
to the gun stock area and you may note
 
02:15:41.290 --> 02:15:41.300 align:start position:0%
Mount Major is one of the most hyped
 
02:15:43.609 --> 02:15:43.619 align:start position:0%
mountains in New Hampshire if you go up
 
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
there in say the end of September on a
 
02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
Saturday you will not find a parking
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
spot they have hundreds of miles of
 
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
hiking trails and they just simply say
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
dogs are welcome but must be must retain
 
02:15:57.890 --> 02:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
under the control of the owners there's
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
no requirement for them to have a leash
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
on it at all times so we look at what my
 
02:16:05.629 --> 02:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
bill would do it simply says
 
02:16:08.450 --> 02:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
that if you're on a hiking trail
 
02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:09.770 align:start position:0%
that if you're on a hiking trail
and

02:16:09.770 --> 02:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
your dog needs to be under the control
 
02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
of the owner the owner has to carry a
 
02:16:16.129 --> 02:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
leash in case it became necessary to
 
02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
restrain the dog
 
02:16:21.169 --> 02:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
um if it's crossing a campground a
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
picnic area parking lots any area where
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles are required uh rest areas then
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
the dog would have to be on a leash in
 
02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
those areas now the state has a very
 
02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
extensive list of
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat confusing rules and it's
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
multiple pages of these on where you can
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
take a dog and where you can't some
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
areas they're banned completely but one
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
is clear it must be on a leash at all
 
02:16:48.830 --> 02:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
times any place in a state park that's
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
the present rule
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
um there are certain Parks like
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
manadnock State Park which I'm assuming
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
the reason is because it's very crowded
 
02:16:59.450 --> 02:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
that dogs aren't allowed at all uh the
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
obvious reasons Hampton Beach State Park
 
02:17:03.530 --> 02:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
there's no hiking trails there anyways
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh odion same thing
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
um they're prohibited and this is a
 
02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
little this gets a little funny some of
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
this is the pets are prohibited
 
02:17:15.129 --> 02:17:15.139 align:start position:0%
seasonally at Pawtuckaway State Park
 
02:17:17.810 --> 02:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
beaches which again my bill wouldn't
 
02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
affect a designated swim areas picnic
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
areas Pavilions and group view series
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
all of those would already be exempt
 
02:17:26.810 --> 02:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
from the requirement to allow dogs off
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
of leashes
 
02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
um and another one is red I find rather
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
the button uh if you look at the
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
Parts with with pet restrictions for
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
inconia State Park which is I think most
 
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
people know where that is up in
 
02:17:49.250 --> 02:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch it's again I just read a
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
thing in the paper it's one of the uh
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
most looked up state parks in the
 
02:17:56.690 --> 02:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
country but uh Franconia State Park dogs
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
only permitted on hiking trails and
 
02:18:02.570 --> 02:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
designated walk area only again my bill
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
would would not change that other than
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't have to have a leash
 
02:18:08.209 --> 02:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
on the hiking trails now the reason I
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
bring that up is maybe you have I have
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
not been there but if you go to
 
02:18:13.129 --> 02:18:13.139 align:start position:0%
Franconia United State Park you start
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
hiking up to the kinsmens you walk along
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
a trail and you start to gain elevation
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
and eventually you come to a sign that
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
says entering White Mountains National
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
Forest now once you pass that sign is no
 
02:18:26.929 --> 02:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
longer required to keep the dog on a
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
leash once you step backwards it's
 
02:18:31.310 --> 02:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
required to me that's silly if it's if
 
02:18:33.290 --> 02:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's a good reason to have it then it
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
should be throughout and the fact that
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains has for years and
 
02:18:39.169 --> 02:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
years and years not required leashes on
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
dogs tells me that not having leashes on
 
02:18:43.969 --> 02:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
dogs is not a problem the same thing
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
with the belt map range I don't know why
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
the the state feels it's necessary to
 
02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
keep these dogs on leashes but again I
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
will reiterate in the hundreds of hikes
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
that I've had in hundreds and hundreds
 
02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
of hikers I've spoke to not once has
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
anyone ever come up to me and said boy
 
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
we had a problem with a dog wasn't on a
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
leash and remember my bill also says You
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
must carry a leash so if you somehow you
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
ran into an aggressive dog you could
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
control your dog physically if necessary
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
just is that a common courtesy when I
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
hike I always ask when I see someone
 
02:19:18.290 --> 02:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
coming are you okay with dogs 99.9
 
02:19:20.929 --> 02:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
percent of the time they say no if they
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
say yes I tell the dog to sit which he's
 
02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:25.019 align:start position:0%
already done put a leash on him and make
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
sure he doesn't get any other person
 
02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
that's just common courtesy we don't
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
need to put that in the laws
 
02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:31.370 align:start position:0%
need to put that in the laws
so

02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:34.009 --> 02:19:34.019 align:start position:0%
there's again I say there's there seems
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
to be no reason to have dogs on leashes
 
02:19:38.929 --> 02:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
except in for some reason in the state
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
park maybe 40 years ago there was an
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
incident in a state park I don't know
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
but I do know that there's been no
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
problems in the White Mountains National
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
Forex or in the Belk map range which are
 
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
extensive miles of hiking trails I mean
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
literally thousands of miles when you
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
put them all together so that's the
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
common sense of uh approach the second
 
02:19:59.929 --> 02:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
thing is a safety factor and the reason
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
I say it's safety factor is I'll just
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
take for example yesterday I was hiking
 
02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
in Pawtuckaway State Park on the back
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
side of the park where most was a lot of
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
hiking North Mountain you can get over
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
to the forest Tower you cannot safely
 
02:20:17.450 --> 02:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
hike with a dog on those trails and the
 
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
reason being is if you're going up or
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
down a hill especially if it's steep
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
especially in the winter time you cannot
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
do it with a dog if you tried going
 
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
especially going downhill if you're
 
02:20:29.929 --> 02:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
going downhill with a dog on a leash
 
02:20:32.210 --> 02:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
unless the dog weighs like five or six
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
pounds you are not going to go the same
 
02:20:36.650 --> 02:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
way the dog does you may have crampons
 
02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
on snowshoes they're going to have four
 
02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
feet you're going to have two and you're
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's an accident that's waiting to
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
happen because if the dog pulls you one
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
way and you pull the other someone's
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
gonna go down and get hurt so it simply
 
02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
isn't safe to do it and so just just
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
think about that for a second if you're
 
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
coming down to fairly steep section
 
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
especially in the winter it's it's just
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
simply not safe to have a dog on a leash
 
02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
it's not confined just to the Winter
 
02:21:03.410 --> 02:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
though think about your crossing a
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
stream you're trying to go across the
 
02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
stream now you're going to be jumping
 
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
from rock to rock or walking on a fallen
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
log the dog is just going to plow
 
02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
through the water it simply doesn't work
 
02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
what I do when I especially when I lead
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
groups is I have my dog with me is I'll
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
have them cross the stream first go on
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
the other side and wait therefore he
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't interfere with anybody else
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
because everyone else is trying to make
 
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
sure they don't fall in the water and
 
02:21:26.809 --> 02:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be bumped by a dog
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
who's running across so it's really a
 
02:21:30.889 --> 02:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
safety factor I mean if you're saying
 
02:21:33.050 --> 02:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
you have to have a dog on a leash at all
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
times then you're saying dogs should not
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
be allowed in any place where there's
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
any elevation gang a loss or any streams
 
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
to cross because it simply is not safe
 
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
the last Factor I'll mention is
 
02:21:47.809 --> 02:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement because you might hear
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
something about this how are we going to
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
enforce the law how is it we're going to
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
be able to see if the dog is under
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
someone's control if they're not
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
physically on a leash
 
02:21:59.210 --> 02:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
well again that doesn't seem to be a
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
problem in the White Mountains it
 
02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be a problem in the
 
02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
Belknap range because they don't require
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
a leash but even that is a red herring
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
because the this will be enforced
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
exactly the same way the law is enforced
 
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
now and that is it will not be enforced
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
on all those hundreds of hikes I've told
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
you on we go to there's a park called
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
Northwood Meadows which is only a few
 
02:22:24.290 --> 02:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
miles from my house and it's a state
 
02:22:27.010 --> 02:22:27.020 align:start position:0%
park and it says dogs must be on leashes
 
02:22:30.530 --> 02:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
and my latest dog is eight years old and
 
02:22:32.929 --> 02:22:32.939 align:start position:0%
we probably average one day a week going
 
02:22:35.570 --> 02:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
over there anyways never in those
 
02:22:37.370 --> 02:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
hundreds of trips over there over the
 
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
last eight years am I seeing a single
 
02:22:42.050 --> 02:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
Park employee on a hiking trail not one
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't like this would be weekends
 
02:22:47.210 --> 02:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
holidays weekdays weekdays mornings
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
afternoons not a single one we also
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
frequent Pawtuckaway State Park a lot I
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
used to go there to do a lot of climbing
 
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a little bit too old for
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
that now but I still do a lot of hiking
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
we come in through the reservation
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
roadside or the Round Pond Side where
 
02:23:02.690 --> 02:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
there's there's no Gates there's no
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
admission charge whatever you just park
 
02:23:09.290 --> 02:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
and go hiking again I have never seen a
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
Park employee on those and even going up
 
02:23:13.730 --> 02:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
to the more common used places like
 
02:23:15.889 --> 02:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
where the forest Tower is in Pawtuckaway
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
never seeing a Park employee on a hiking
 
02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
trail so it isn't an Enforcement issue
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
because it's not enforced now so I'm
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
just asking bring a little common sense
 
02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
it gives an exception in the law it says
 
02:23:28.849 --> 02:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
that there's areas like an ad knock
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
State Park which they must I'm assuming
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
they deem because of crowded that they a
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
park Department could post and say if it
 
02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know if it has unique conditions
 
02:23:40.969 --> 02:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
with such as high pedestrian traffic the
 
02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
department shell posts such trails with
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
signage that that indicate that all dogs
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
must be leased so again Common Sense
 
02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
safety and don't listen to any argument
 
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
about enforcement because that's totally
 
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
a red herring and I'd be glad to take
 
02:23:57.410 --> 02:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any questions by
 
02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.809 --> 02:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
representative wrong thank you Mr
 
02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
um are you concerned about any Hazard or
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
damage a dog may cause if if it's
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
um you mean like actually like to
 
02:24:22.510 --> 02:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
Wildlife or something like that or
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
nesting areas Wildlife maybe there's
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
some sensitive areas off Trail an
 
02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
Unleashed dog going into those areas and
 
02:24:32.090 --> 02:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
causing damage
 
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
well again all I can say is I've never
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
heard of that being an issue and again I
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
go back to the White Mountains National
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
Forest which is many times larger than
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
our state park systems and they do not
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
think that's an issue and I rely on
 
02:24:49.730 --> 02:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
their Wildlife biologists because they
 
02:24:52.370 --> 02:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
don't stop you from having a dog not on
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
a leash so I assume they must think it's
 
02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
not an issue so I have to say no it's
 
02:24:58.490 --> 02:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
not an issue okay thank you
 
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:02.690 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

02:25:02.690 --> 02:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gould yes thank you for
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question I'm not quite sure
 
02:25:12.889 --> 02:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
how to did you say that uh
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh dogs on list leashes are not a
 
02:25:16.319 --> 02:25:19.070 align:start position:0%
uh dogs on list leashes are not a
problem

02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
dogs off leashes are not a problem dogs
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
on leashes are not a problem I haven't
 
02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
seen any problems with dogs one way or
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest the most aggressive
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
dogs that people that I've run into and
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
like I say I go let's do this all the
 
02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
time our dog's on leashes they tend to
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
be on leashes and I think dogs have a
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
situation where there's sort of a fight
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
or flight and since they can't run away
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
because they're on a leash those are the
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
ones that tend to growl the most but
 
02:25:50.330 --> 02:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
it's you generally rely on the owner and
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
I like I say this is years and years of
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
taking a dog hiking and simply asking a
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
simple question is your dog okay with
 
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
other dogs and if they say no then we
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
make sure both parties make sure the
 
02:26:04.490 --> 02:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
dogs stay separate and you know for the
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
most part they say yes and all they want
 
02:26:08.690 --> 02:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
to do is play and sniff bums I mean
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:14.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Darby
 
02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:20.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question sorry but you see
 
02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
right we're blocked there
 
02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that uh you know
 
02:26:27.650 --> 02:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
obviously you hike a lot and you've seen
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of dogs off leash because like you
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
said um people aren't following the
 
02:26:33.650 --> 02:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
current law
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
um are are these dogs that you've seen
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
off leash are they under control
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
um would you what you would consider
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
control and how far ahead of the
 
02:26:44.929 --> 02:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
um you know of their owners are they
 
02:26:44.939 --> 02:26:45.969 align:start position:0%
um you know of their owners are they
typically

02:26:45.969 --> 02:26:45.979 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
most almost all the time the dogs are
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
with the owner and they're fairly close
 
02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're able to take
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of that by saying you'll see
 
02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
somebody coming and you simply ask the
 
02:26:58.250 --> 02:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
question is the dog get along with other
 
02:26:58.260 --> 02:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
question is the dog get along with other
dogs

02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
02:27:02.090 --> 02:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
um two days ago we were over in
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
Northwood and it was my dog was off
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
leash he was close to me and there was a
 
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
woman quite a ways down and she saw her
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
up and she just said okay my dog doesn't
 
02:27:13.730 --> 02:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
like other dogs so I told my dog to sit
 
02:27:15.770 --> 02:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
I put a leash on him she walked over to
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
one side I walked over the other side
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
and we walked by the only time I've
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
really seen a dog uh away from its owner
 
02:27:25.309 --> 02:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time we were
 
02:27:26.809 --> 02:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
hiking in the White Mountains we were
 
02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
staying overnight at a shelter we get in
 
02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
around five o'clock it was the summer
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
time and it's just always remember this
 
02:27:34.490 --> 02:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of funny this very
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
large Saint Bernard like 150 pounds
 
02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
showed up came over and plumped itself
 
02:27:41.929 --> 02:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
down next to us and we gave him some
 
02:27:43.969 --> 02:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
water we gave him some food we didn't
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
know where he came from because there
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
was multiple Trails going back so we
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't really backtrack and about an
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
hour and a half two hours later two
 
02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
people showed up one of them had twisted
 
02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
their ankle it was going really slow
 
02:27:56.090 --> 02:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's as long as I've seen a dog and
 
02:27:57.230 --> 02:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
the dog didn't do anything except sit
 
02:27:59.210 --> 02:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
there and didn't eat so it was it was
 
02:28:01.130 --> 02:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
not an issue I just think it's most
 
02:28:03.530 --> 02:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
people show common sense and the fact
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we've had years and years and years
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the belt map range in in South which
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
is the southeast Land Trust doesn't
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
require a leash and in the White
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
Mountains tell us that this simply isn't
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
an issue because if people were getting
 
02:28:18.650 --> 02:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
attacked by dogs or dogs were attacking
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
other dogs in the White Mountains they
 
02:28:22.429 --> 02:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
would quickly do something about it it's
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:33.469 align:start position:0%
anyone else
representative

02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:28:40.130 --> 02:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
um my my two labs for their 13 Years
 
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
love to roam the trails specifically
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
horse Health Nature Preserve
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
the operative word being horse we had a
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
horse farm near us or a horse uh Paddock
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
near us
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they loved people and the question
 
02:28:59.210 --> 02:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
is and the question is have you spoken
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
any horse owners I'll ask it for I think
 
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh representative vale's not not around
 
02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:04.790 align:start position:0%
uh representative vale's not not around
here

02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
have you spoken to any horse users or
 
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
questions well actually not specifically
 
02:29:12.889 --> 02:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
but I did get a couple of emails sort of
 
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
out of the blue on the bill by by one
 
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
woman who said she likes to go with her
 
02:29:19.610 --> 02:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
horse and her dog and she was in favor
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill a common sense would tell me
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
that if I see someone and once in a
 
02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
while you do see horses it's not that
 
02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
common in New Hampshire but there are
 
02:29:29.929 --> 02:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
some parks we used to you run into some
 
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
Trails if I see the door my horse coming
 
02:29:34.250 --> 02:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put the dog on a leash and
 
02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
again that you are required to have a
 
02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
leash with this and that's just pure
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
safety because you don't want the dog
 
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
going up and barking at the horse which
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
could toss the rider and I don't want
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
the Taurus kicking the dog because let's
 
02:29:48.170 --> 02:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
face it they're a lot bigger than dogs
 
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
so again you're required to carry a
 
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
leash with you just for situations like
 
02:29:54.650 --> 02:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
that as unusual as they are you'd be
 
02:29:56.210 --> 02:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
covered you could see the horse coming
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
put the dog on the leash and make sure

information the division already allows
 
02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
dogs off leash and under the control of

pursuant to Department administrative
 
02:31:30.540 --> 02:31:31.990 align:start position:0%
pursuant to Department administrative
rules

02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:31:35.330 --> 02:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
730108 and except for State Park areas
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
where dogs are prohibited year-round of
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
which there are only four state parks
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
um in remote areas dogs shall be
 
02:31:44.270 --> 02:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
permitted off leash and under the
 
02:31:45.889 --> 02:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
control of their handlers in accordance
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
with RSA 466 30A provided that the dog
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
is not or does not become a menace a
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
nuisance or vicious as defined in RSA
 
02:31:58.130 --> 02:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
46631 under which the owner or the
 
02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
Handover Handler shall restrain leash
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
and remove the dog from the property
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this section remote
 
02:32:07.130 --> 02:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
areas means those areas and trails where
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
and during a time when the dog owner or
 
02:32:10.969 --> 02:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
Handler and the dog will not come into
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%

02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
owner or Handler shall leash and Leash
 
02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
the dog when other users are present our
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
ability to tailor our administrative
 
02:32:22.969 --> 02:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
rules on animals and state parks allows
 
02:32:24.410 --> 02:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
for changes over time based on
 
02:32:26.690 --> 02:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
communities Trends and other factors
 
02:32:28.610 --> 02:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
such as development and improvements to
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
the parks visitation levels and other
 
02:32:32.090 --> 02:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
natural resource management
 
02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
considerations thank you for the
 
02:32:35.929 --> 02:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide the testimony on
 
02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
this bill we hope that the existing
 
02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that allows dogs to
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
be off leash and under the control of
 
02:32:43.610 --> 02:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
their Handler addressed as the concerned
 
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
concerns of the Bill's sponsors and
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
therefore hb-141 is not necessary
 
02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
 
02:32:55.380 --> 02:33:00.610 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
committee

02:33:00.610 --> 02:33:00.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:00.620 --> 02:33:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:04.849 --> 02:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so my question is
 
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
that the I'm assuming that the penalty
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
for a dog off off leash in a yeah in the
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
other zones is a fine do we have any
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
sense of of how many of those were
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
issued last year or the year before
 
02:33:16.319 --> 02:33:16.849 align:start position:0%
issued last year or the year before
um

02:33:16.849 --> 02:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
just to give us an idea of how often
 
02:33:21.050 --> 02:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
this is this is occurring
 
02:33:24.650 --> 02:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
um so uh we do not actually issue uh
 
02:33:26.929 --> 02:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
fines uh where we're
 
02:33:30.170 --> 02:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
um the the rule is uh to
 
02:33:32.450 --> 02:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
um in this particular case would be to
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
to lease your dog and leave the premises
 
02:33:37.849 --> 02:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
um so that would be under the the
 
02:33:39.889 --> 02:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
enforcement action
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
um really would be a pretty light touch
 
02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
of uh of uh just a an account with if
 
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
they were to run into a park staff but
 
02:33:50.330 --> 02:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
we're not actually issuing fines on this
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
you finished
 
02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:59.330 align:start position:0%
you finished
representative

02:33:59.330 --> 02:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
no representative Gould do you have a
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
question no oh okay you got your mic on
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
it oh okay
 
02:34:11.690 --> 02:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Dunn
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I've been asked to present this on
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
the website it says that all animals
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
must be on a standard or retractable
 
02:34:21.530 --> 02:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
leash not greater than six feet in
 
02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:22.670 align:start position:0%
leash not greater than six feet in
length

02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
length
 
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
um is that uh
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
from our from our website then yes I
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
would imagine that yes our our website
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.770 --> 02:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:46.929 --> 02:34:46.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Paul uh
 
02:34:54.770 --> 02:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
is it
 
02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:56.570 align:start position:0%
is it
Severson

02:34:56.570 --> 02:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
Severson
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
Nickerson okay
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
all right sorry about the left-handed
 
02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:04.969 align:start position:0%
all right sorry about the left-handed
reading

02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
reading
 
02:35:04.979 --> 02:35:07.370 align:start position:0%
reading
so

02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
no microphone
 
02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
push spit around there yeah there you go
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
is it clear now oh yeah very
 
02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony is very brief so I'm going
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
to read it we oppose this bill for a lot
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
of reasons
 
02:35:33.230 --> 02:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is that keeping
 
02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
dogs under control is kind of a nebulous
 
02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.370 align:start position:0%
dogs under control is kind of a nebulous
concept

02:35:37.370 --> 02:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
concept
 
02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
and it's in the eye of the beholder and
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
the further out they are from not being
 
02:35:44.330 --> 02:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
under control the more damage they'll do
 
02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:46.429 align:start position:0%
under control the more damage they'll do
so

02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
dog owners are unlikely to restrict
 
02:35:50.929 --> 02:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
their animals to a trail proper and may
 
02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
allow them to explore both sides of a
 
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
trail while allegedly within verbal
 
02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:56.990 align:start position:0%
trail while allegedly within verbal
control

02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
such exploration presents risks to
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
Native Wildlife especially during the
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
nesting season
 
02:36:06.050 --> 02:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
Brown nesting Birds including game birds
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
like rough Grouse Woodcock and wild
 
02:36:10.969 --> 02:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
turkey as well as non-game species such
 
02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
as hermit thrush and oven bird are
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to Nest failure triggered by
 
02:36:16.730 --> 02:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
curious dogs
 
02:36:19.010 --> 02:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
are also known to capture young birds
 
02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
not able to fly well
 
02:36:25.610 --> 02:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
now if any of you are hunters even in
 
02:36:27.650 --> 02:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
October if you if you've hunted with
 
02:36:28.969 --> 02:36:28.979 align:start position:0%
dogs and you wonder if they chase
 
02:36:30.710 --> 02:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
Wildlife or not all you got to do is
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
remember the day when your dog got a
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
nose full of porcupine quills so we know
 
02:36:38.270 --> 02:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
they chase wildlife other times you've
 
02:36:39.770 --> 02:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
probably seen if you were hunting birds
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen them chasing
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
rabbits so it's not as easily definable
 
02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
as one might think in terms of wildlife
 
02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:48.530 align:start position:0%
as one might think in terms of wildlife
impacts

02:36:48.530 --> 02:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
now our stated Mission or the State
 
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
admission of the division of Parks and
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
Recreation is to provide New Hampshire
 
02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
citizens and guests with outstanding
 
02:36:58.969 --> 02:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
recreational educational and
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
inspirational experience now I'm going
 
02:37:02.929 --> 02:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
to emphasize through the responsible

stays very close so we don't have a
 
02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:32.210 align:start position:0%
stays very close so we don't have a
problem

02:38:32.210 --> 02:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:38:33.889 --> 02:38:33.899 align:start position:0%

appreciate your hearing me today
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Lisa post I'm from
 
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough District 42 which covers
 
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
lineborough Mount Vernon New Boston and
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to introduce today house bill
 
02:38:51.439 --> 02:38:53.050 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to introduce today house bill
434fn

02:38:53.050 --> 02:38:53.060 align:start position:0%
434fn
 
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
as many of you may remember
 
02:38:59.809 --> 02:38:59.819 align:start position:0%
this bill came before us last
 
02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
term and
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
the bill before you now has changed
 
02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:08.590 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
and

02:39:08.590 --> 02:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
the difference with this spill from the
 
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
other bill
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
is a whole host of changes and one of
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
the main
 
02:39:24.530 --> 02:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
reasons for it to be a diversion from
 
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
the last bill because it only applies to
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
state parks and not the Statewide trail
 
02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:30.730 align:start position:0%
state parks and not the Statewide trail
system

02:39:30.730 --> 02:39:30.740 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
we have drew McCallum here and I'd like
 
02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
to bring him up after my testimony to
 
02:39:42.290 --> 02:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
come and speak to all the nitty-gritty
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill because it has changed a
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
lot and the FAA isn't involved anymore
 
02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
and it
 
02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh is a good thing I think to put this
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
forth and allow people to use it
 
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
commercially and recreationally
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
um in the Parks
 
02:40:08.450 --> 02:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for the commercial and
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
recreational use of drones
 
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
or small unmanned aircraft in state
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
parks subject to exceptions and
 
02:40:19.790 --> 02:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
limitations the bill also establishes
 
02:40:22.969 --> 02:40:22.979 align:start position:0%
fees and authorizes fines to be assessed
 
02:40:25.490 --> 02:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
for violations
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
this again is a constituent bill
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
and I am proud to be able to support our
 
02:40:36.410 --> 02:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
constituents in the legislature and I'd
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
like to bring them up to address the
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee there are before I end this I
 
02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
do have the fiscal note
 
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
um that you probably have the bill but
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
that shows that that there are fines for
 
02:40:57.530 --> 02:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
up to 25 fees for up to 25 a day and for
 
02:41:01.330 --> 02:41:01.340 align:start position:0%
drone violations where things occur
 
02:41:05.570 --> 02:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
there will be fines assessed and it is
 
02:41:09.650 --> 02:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
an in in in German blah blah blah
 
02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:11.870 align:start position:0%
an in in in German blah blah blah
indeterminable

02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
um amount uh for them to project since
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
this hasn't been allowed before
 
02:41:21.530 --> 02:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:41:25.250 --> 02:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
um could we have Mr mckellick come up
 
02:41:25.260 --> 02:41:26.450 align:start position:0%
um could we have Mr mckellick come up
here

02:41:26.450 --> 02:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:41:30.170 --> 02:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
right so he is has
 
02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
the basic knowledge and it was part of
 
02:41:37.130 --> 02:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
the creation of the bill yes okay I'll
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'll allow that where is he thank you Mr

to stay with him or I do you wish okay
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
just so I can enjoy that
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.290 --> 02:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:41:58.849 --> 02:41:58.859 align:start position:0%

the past couple months to resubmit a
 
02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
similar Bill to what you saw last year
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
um I work as a data scientist for IBM
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm from a family of Pilots my dad
 
02:42:35.270 --> 02:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
is a pilot my younger brothers are

02:42:40.370 --> 02:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
uncle's a pilot many extended family
 
02:42:42.130 --> 02:42:42.140 align:start position:0%
members who are pilots
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
I've been a licensed private pilot since
 
02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
the age of 22 and I soloed in gliders
 
02:42:49.070 --> 02:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
when I was 16 years old
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
since I was about eight years old I have
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
been flying remote controlled aircraft
 
02:42:57.410 --> 02:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
and this is now referred to as drone
 
02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:58.910 align:start position:0%
and this is now referred to as drone
piloting

02:42:58.910 --> 02:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
piloting
 
02:43:00.830 --> 02:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
about three years ago the state park
 
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
system banned drone launches and
 
02:43:03.770 --> 02:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
landings without establishing a
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
straightforward permitting process which
 
02:43:07.969 --> 02:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
I believe is an undue burden on drone
 
02:43:07.979 --> 02:43:09.050 align:start position:0%
I believe is an undue burden on drone
users

02:43:09.050 --> 02:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
users
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
I testified in front of this committee
 
02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
exactly a year ago on a similar bill
 
02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
which was HB 1292 in the 2022 session
 
02:43:18.170 --> 02:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
that bill was itl by this committee on
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
several technicalities which gave me and
 
02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
several other drone Pilots the
 
02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take feedback from this
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee and other community members to
 
02:43:28.490 --> 02:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
submit a greatly improved bill on this
 
02:43:30.650 --> 02:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
session I specifically want to thank
 
02:43:33.650 --> 02:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
Maurice apienza my friend who's a lawyer
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
and former State Rep from Newton
 
02:43:37.309 --> 02:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
Junction for legal advice and support on
 
02:43:39.770 --> 02:43:39.780 align:start position:0%

02:43:42.110 --> 02:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
both the land and above with her drone
 
02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
I also want to thank Vic moss and Kenji
 
02:43:45.889 --> 02:43:45.899 align:start position:0%
sugahara they're both nationally
 
02:43:47.570 --> 02:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
recognized Rowan attorneys for the Drone
 
02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
service providers Alliance
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
who helped me revise this bill multiple
 
02:43:54.410 --> 02:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
times and ultimately give me their stamp
 
02:43:55.849 --> 02:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
of approval
 
02:43:57.490 --> 02:43:57.500 align:start position:0%
and lastly I want to thank
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%

submitting the spell on my behalf
 
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
so here are some of the big improvements
 
02:44:06.889 --> 02:44:06.899 align:start position:0%
in this bill from last year's bill as
 
02:44:08.450 --> 02:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative post mentioned this
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
applies to only state parks and not the
 
02:44:13.490 --> 02:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
state park Statewide trail system since
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
the ladder would require rewriting
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
easement agreements with landowners per
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
this committee's feedback
 
02:44:21.590 --> 02:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
number two uh pilot education
 
02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
requirements for both commercial and
 
02:44:25.309 --> 02:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
recreational Pilots is now in the bill
 
02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
which again was another suggestion from
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:44:30.290 --> 02:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh three this drops the permission
 
02:44:31.969 --> 02:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
requirement in the previous bill which
 
02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
parallels the policy of the White
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest so again like
 
02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
the dog bill you heard before we want to
 
02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
keep the policies very similar what
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
works in the white national uh
 
02:44:44.450 --> 02:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
National Forest should probably also
 
02:44:47.050 --> 02:44:47.060 align:start position:0%
work just fine in state parks
 
02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
for this fixes several state and federal
 
02:44:51.770 --> 02:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
overlap of rules there's already a
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
robust set of federal rules about when
 
02:44:55.790 --> 02:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
and where you can fly recreational
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
Pilots are never allowed to fly drones
 
02:44:59.450 --> 02:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
over people and commercial pilots have
 
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
very strict rules no drones are allowed
 
02:45:04.250 --> 02:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
to over fly over open air Assemblies of
 
02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
people so no crowds of people no matter
 
02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:07.010 align:start position:0%
people so no crowds of people no matter
what

02:45:07.010 --> 02:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:45:09.349 --> 02:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
five commercial permits the state can
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
collect a fee from commercial users
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
again paralleling the White Mountain
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
National Forest
 
02:45:19.250 --> 02:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
six this bill bans drone use at The
 
02:45:20.929 --> 02:45:20.939 align:start position:0%
Flume gorge in peak season as well as
 
02:45:22.429 --> 02:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain during ski operating
 
02:45:24.770 --> 02:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
hours so that was another suggestion I
 
02:45:26.570 --> 02:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
believe from one of the Commissioners in
 
02:45:28.969 --> 02:45:28.979 align:start position:0%
their testimony last year and lastly
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
seven we added a clause that prohibits
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
flights that would interfere with the
 
02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
reasonable enjoyment of the park by
 
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
other users
 
02:45:37.370 --> 02:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
and some of the other testimonies last
 
02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
year there was talk about the disruption
 
02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
that drones would cause the state parks
 
02:45:43.010 --> 02:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
already have significant disruptions due
 
02:45:44.990 --> 02:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
to overcrowding of people if there were
 
02:45:46.849 --> 02:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
true concern for disruptions the state
 
02:45:48.530 --> 02:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
park system should do more to limit the
 
02:45:50.330 --> 02:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
number of people in the Parks and on the
 
02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
trails rather than have an unreasonable
 
02:45:54.710 --> 02:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
drone ban I have a picture in my written
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
testimony showing artist Bluff on
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day weekend last year and you
 
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
can see there's hundreds of people there
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
and they can do a lot more to limit the
 
02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
amount of parking but I think going
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
after drones trying to to fix the issues
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't work
 
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
people are already ignoring the Drone
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
ban and flying anyways uh recently I
 
02:46:16.849 --> 02:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
counted over 30 YouTube videos of drones
 
02:46:19.010 --> 02:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
flying in Crawford Notch State Park
 
02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:20.210 align:start position:0%
flying in Crawford Notch State Park
alone

02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
alone
 
02:46:22.010 --> 02:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it be better to have a drone
 
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
flying in state parks sanctioned with
 
02:46:27.530 --> 02:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable rules and regulations
 
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
a number of points I made last year I
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
spoke about hunting which is permitted
 
02:46:33.170 --> 02:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
in state parks and does cause multiple
 
02:46:35.389 --> 02:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
deaths in New Hampshire each year and
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
again drones are much much safer than
 
02:46:40.010 --> 02:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
hunting I've known of no incidents in
 
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that would be reason to
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
cause us to have strict rules against
 
02:46:45.650 --> 02:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
having drones
 
02:46:47.389 --> 02:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's a great marketing opportunity for
 
02:46:48.830 --> 02:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
the state so you can have more social
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
media presence
 
02:46:51.889 --> 02:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
and this is also good for children
 
02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
interested in stem Fields so there's a
 
02:46:55.010 --> 02:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
group of fourth graders visiting from
 
02:46:56.809 --> 02:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
Plymouth right behind me they are the
 
02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
future we got to do this for them we got
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
to keep these opportunities open for
 
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
aerial videography is a popular medium
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
today and it allows more people to
 
02:47:09.410 --> 02:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
access scenery who otherwise wouldn't be
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:47:13.849 --> 02:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
so it's an accessibility issue as well
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is an excellent bill that was well
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
vetted by multiple attorneys and other
 
02:47:19.490 --> 02:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
drone stakeholders and I asked the
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee to give this bill a not to
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation I'd be happy to
 
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
answer questions thank you Mr chairman
 
02:47:28.130 --> 02:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:47:34.130 --> 02:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative wrong thank you Mr
 
02:47:36.349 --> 02:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
chairman representative wolf and thank
 
02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I want to
 
02:47:40.250 --> 02:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
follow up on a comment I want to make
 
02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
sure I heard it correctly when you were
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
referencing the number of people using
 
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
the state parks and crowds were you
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the state limit the
 
02:47:51.650 --> 02:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
number of people of state parks to
 
02:47:53.330 --> 02:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
accommodate people who want to use
 
02:47:56.809 --> 02:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
drones no I'm saying
 
02:47:59.090 --> 02:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
if there's concern about disrupting
 
02:48:00.889 --> 02:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
wildlife and disrupting the natural
 
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
state of the Wilderness whatever there
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
should be more done to limit the crowds
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
rather than have a blanket rule Against
 
02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:13.809 align:start position:0%
rather than have a blanket rule Against
drones

02:48:13.809 --> 02:48:13.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.849 --> 02:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative wolf question
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you uh
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
specifically excluded Cannon Mountain
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
during the ski area
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
I happen to live next to Mount Sunapee
 
02:48:29.210 --> 02:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh would that be one that would be
 
02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
banned during the ski season even though
 
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
it is leased out I don't know the terms
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
of the least but I assume they have
 
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
control over that and they currently do
 
02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
not allow drones at Mount Sunapee under
 
02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
their lease
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:52.190 --> 02:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:54.990 align:start position:0%
anyone else
okay

02:48:54.990 --> 02:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:56.710 align:start position:0%
okay

Harvey bolia
 
02:49:03.650 --> 02:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh where
 
02:49:08.330 --> 02:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
would you uh foresee uh launching these
 
02:49:10.910 --> 02:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
drones from and Landing them
 
02:49:14.210 --> 02:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
adjacent to Trails that aren't being
 
02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
heavily utilized
 
02:49:17.450 --> 02:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of wilderness areas
 
02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:18.650 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of wilderness areas
that

02:49:18.650 --> 02:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:21.230 --> 02:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
you could hike to and this fits right in
 
02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
the backpack
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
so you could take it you could get some
 
02:49:26.270 --> 02:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
nice photos once you get above the trees
 
02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
so it'd be like open areas it wouldn't
 
02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
be congested areas where there's a lot
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
um and you would have to have a nice
 
02:49:35.570 --> 02:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
landing site that's not too wooded
 
02:49:38.530 --> 02:49:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey Bowie for a
 
02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:41.750 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey Bowie for a
question

02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
um one quick one question then perhaps a
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up but
 
02:49:50.929 --> 02:49:50.939 align:start position:0%
um to piggyback on that question about
 
02:49:50.939 --> 02:49:53.090 align:start position:0%
um to piggyback on that question about
takeoff

02:49:53.090 --> 02:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
takeoff
 
02:49:57.889 --> 02:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
um as a I've got my certified uas
 
02:49:59.929 --> 02:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
license uh
 
02:49:59.939 --> 02:50:01.370 align:start position:0%
license uh
license

02:50:01.370 --> 02:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:50:03.230 --> 02:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and I've flown drones
 
02:50:05.570 --> 02:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh does this and I'm sorry I don't have
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't get a copy of the bill in my
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
packet if you have an extra one I
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind it
 
02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
um the takeoff I know uh from experience
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
that if a drone is uh launched near cars
 
02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
or Metals anything metal thank you
 
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
um that it can malfunction because this
 
02:50:26.270 --> 02:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
actually happened to me
 
02:50:30.050 --> 02:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
um when launching from a parking lot
 
02:50:30.060 --> 02:50:30.650 align:start position:0%
um when launching from a parking lot
um

02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
and it the metal from the cars can
 
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with the Drone the software
 
02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
and the Drone and what happened was I
 
02:50:41.690 --> 02:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
was flying it and then suddenly my
 
02:50:43.730 --> 02:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
controller was unresponsive and it flew
 
02:50:44.809 --> 02:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
into a tree
 
02:50:47.210 --> 02:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh luckily nobody was hurt but
 
02:50:50.929 --> 02:50:50.939 align:start position:0%
it was pretty uh alarming so
 
02:50:54.230 --> 02:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
um does your bill speak to that at all
 
02:50:56.990 --> 02:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes it does okay um there's a section in
 
02:50:57.950 --> 02:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
there I don't have the bill right in
 
02:50:59.210 --> 02:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
front of me but there is a section about
 
02:51:05.410 --> 02:51:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:08.809 --> 02:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't prohibit the it it
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit people from launching
 
02:51:12.830 --> 02:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
in a parking in the parking lot does it
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
it does not but there are there are
 
02:51:17.090 --> 02:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
plenty of rules I'm at the federal level
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
that do cover uh flight safety and if
 
02:51:22.730 --> 02:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's not a safer to fly
 
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
there's there's plenty of uh FAA for
 
02:51:27.290 --> 02:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
ours said
 
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
Reddit uh flying in bad areas okay um
 
02:51:33.290 --> 02:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
one other question for a follow-up
 
02:51:36.530 --> 02:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up last one and as far as now
 
02:51:38.929 --> 02:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned Cannon Mountain and
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
one of the issues with drones is
 
02:51:43.670 --> 02:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
obviously you can with the new ones you
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
can set them to follow and track people
 
02:51:50.090 --> 02:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
um which oftentimes is you know it's
 
02:51:52.610 --> 02:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
your own drone and you want the Drone to
 
02:51:55.790 --> 02:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
follow you down the ski mountain and
 
02:51:58.849 --> 02:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
film yourself skiing and that's what my
 
02:52:00.290 --> 02:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
understanding is why they're prohibited
 
02:52:02.330 --> 02:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
in ski areas
 
02:52:04.250 --> 02:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in your bill that
 
02:52:06.769 --> 02:52:06.779 align:start position:0%
kind of speaks to I think I did see it
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
but if you could clarify how you can you
 
02:52:11.090 --> 02:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
people don't want to be tracked
 
02:52:13.190 --> 02:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
obviously unless they've given
 
02:52:14.809 --> 02:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
permission so
 
02:52:16.969 --> 02:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
correct yeah there's a clause at the end
 
02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
that describes
 
02:52:21.290 --> 02:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
um getting written permission if you are
 
02:52:24.769 --> 02:52:24.779 align:start position:0%
trying to loiter and track a certain
 
02:52:26.690 --> 02:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
person and that parallels the language
 
02:52:28.490 --> 02:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
that was written into
 
02:52:31.550 --> 02:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
um the current law regarding spying on
 
02:52:33.769 --> 02:52:33.779 align:start position:0%
people hunting
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:40.969 --> 02:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
okay any other mem any other members of
 
02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.570 --> 02:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
of Representative Kelly
 
02:52:50.330 --> 02:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm just doing playback to last year
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
so My my language about the the 25 fee
 
02:52:58.309 --> 02:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
um assessed by the department
 
02:53:00.290 --> 02:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
for commercial use I just think that a
 
02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
ranger or somebody in the park is going
 
02:53:05.210 --> 02:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
to have difficulty no no distinguishing
 
02:53:07.210 --> 02:53:07.220 align:start position:0%
commercial use versus like you're you
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
yourself are a drone pilot I assume that
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
you you know offer services at some
 
02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:13.190 align:start position:0%
you you know offer services at some
level

02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
um a single person it's not like a film
 
02:53:16.610 --> 02:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
crew from a from a movie where it's
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
obvious that this is commercial use it
 
02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
can be difficult to distinguish between
 
02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
recreational and commercial use so the I
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
believe the language in last year's bill
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
so that it was the responsibility of the
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
pilot to assess to to pay the or to
 
02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
notify the department and pay the fee or
 
02:53:33.530 --> 02:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
we at least had discussion about that I
 
02:53:34.490 --> 02:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was actually in the
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill so my my we made a change to the
 
02:53:36.960 --> 02:53:38.030 align:start position:0%
bill so my my we made a change to the
bill

02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
um that made it the Pilot's
 
02:53:41.090 --> 02:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility to say that they're doing
 
02:53:43.849 --> 02:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
it for commercial use would you you
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
in favor of that
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm in favor that's how it's
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
currently written it is up to the pilot
 
02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
to determine that because as a
 
02:53:52.730 --> 02:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
commercial pilot I can fly this I can
 
02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
fly the Drone recreationally just for my
 
02:53:56.090 --> 02:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
own enjoyment that's what I do most of
 
02:53:58.429 --> 02:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
the time it is a picture of my own my
 
02:53:59.809 --> 02:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
own fun
 
02:53:59.819 --> 02:54:00.590 align:start position:0%
own fun
um

02:54:00.590 --> 02:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:03.469 --> 02:54:03.479 align:start position:0%
but you know it parallels the policy in
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
the White Mountain National Forest they
 
02:54:06.650 --> 02:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
have the same system as well it's up to
 
02:54:08.450 --> 02:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
the the pilot to determine what the the
 
02:54:10.370 --> 02:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
use is and it's kind of the honor System
 
02:54:11.809 --> 02:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
um whether or not they should pay the
 
02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.490 align:start position:0%
um whether or not they should pay the
fee

02:54:16.490 --> 02:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:18.889 --> 02:54:18.899 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh
 
02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm also a
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
recreational drone pilot until I've
 
02:54:26.570 --> 02:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
drowned mine off the back of the boat
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
um so I've been thinking about replacing
 
02:54:30.769 --> 02:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
it does your bill address different
 
02:54:33.290 --> 02:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
restrictions different sizes from the
 
02:54:35.990 --> 02:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
small little mavic to the Phantom to the
 
02:54:38.809 --> 02:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
big agris and octocopters all the
 
02:54:40.969 --> 02:54:40.979 align:start position:0%
different DJI the the little ones the
 
02:54:44.150 --> 02:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
big ones because you know some are tiny
 
02:54:46.429 --> 02:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
little pocket ones and then some are
 
02:54:48.650 --> 02:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
much more invasive and annoying to the
 
02:54:51.290 --> 02:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
average hiker
 
02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
yeah that's kind of out of the
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in the state that's up to
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
the FAA to come up with a lot of the
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
regulations as far as what's flying in
 
02:55:00.290 --> 02:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
the airspace uh State can only really
 
02:55:02.269 --> 02:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
control what's launching and landing on
 
02:55:05.570 --> 02:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
on state lands and
 
02:55:07.309 --> 02:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
it really it's just going to be people
 
02:55:09.769 --> 02:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
that have small drones and backpacks for
 
02:55:10.990 --> 02:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
the most part
 
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
the really expensive big drones I mean
 
02:55:14.510 --> 02:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
it just
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah they're probably more of a nuisance
 
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
but there's just not that many of them
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
and this really limited to large-scale
 
02:55:20.750 --> 02:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
film Crews that are going to be using
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be
 
02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
so so the one you have there is like a
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
mavic air and that's like the most
 
02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:34.250 align:start position:0%
mavic air and that's like the most
common

02:55:34.250 --> 02:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
common
 
02:55:36.889 --> 02:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
that the average tourist or the that
 
02:55:38.750 --> 02:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would pertain to correct yeah
 
02:55:40.490 --> 02:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
DJI makes a drone that's a little bit
 
02:55:41.929 --> 02:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
bigger than this but it's really not
 
02:55:43.610 --> 02:55:43.620 align:start position:0%
going to be anything bigger than like
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
Yay big it's
 
02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
um generally going to be backpack size
 
02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:49.269 align:start position:0%
um generally going to be backpack size
drones

02:55:49.269 --> 02:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
drones
 
02:55:52.010 --> 02:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up thank you
 
02:55:55.730 --> 02:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
and that's limited to less than 400 feet
 
02:55:58.130 --> 02:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
correct correct above ground level
 
02:56:00.410 --> 02:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:03.230 --> 02:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
any more questions from the from the

drone use on lands owned by the state

as determined by the department
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
although the bill prohibits flights that
 
02:59:07.849 --> 02:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
intentionally interfere with the
 
02:59:10.429 --> 02:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable use and enjoyment of the park
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
by other visitors the definition of this
 
02:59:15.950 --> 02:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
provision is unclear and unenforceable
 
02:59:17.870 --> 02:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
the bill also prohibits the use of
 
02:59:20.269 --> 02:59:20.279 align:start position:0%
drones with the intent to conduct video
 
02:59:22.910 --> 02:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
surveillance of private citizens and we
 
02:59:24.889 --> 02:59:24.899 align:start position:0%
believe that that provision is also
 
02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
unenforceable unenforceable and that a
 
02:59:29.290 --> 02:59:29.300 align:start position:0%
visitor's privacy could be
 
02:59:31.730 --> 02:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
unintentionally impacted
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
loss of recreational access we are
 
02:59:36.349 --> 02:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
dependent on the willingness of private
 
02:59:37.849 --> 02:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
landowners to allow trails in the
 
02:59:39.950 --> 02:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide trail system to cross their
 
02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
lands for public use we are very
 
02:59:43.250 --> 02:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
concerned that those landowners would no
 
02:59:45.290 --> 02:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
longer permit the public use of their
 
02:59:47.210 --> 02:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
property if they were required to allow
 
02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
drone uses on Trails they owned and
 
02:59:51.610 --> 02:59:51.620 align:start position:0%
drone use would not
 
02:59:54.170 --> 02:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
drone users would not know when they
 
02:59:56.929 --> 02:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
have crossed onto privately owned lands
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
commercial use lastly we already have a
 
03:00:01.849 --> 03:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
process for granting commercial use of
 
03:00:03.769 --> 03:00:03.779 align:start position:0%
drones by issuance of a special use
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
permit under administrative rules
 
03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
special use means any event activity or
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
use that is beyond the normal or routine
 
03:00:13.250 --> 03:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
recreational use of a specific
 
03:00:16.010 --> 03:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
dread property or an event activity or
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
other use requiring a permit
 
03:00:20.330 --> 03:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
permits enable the department to
 
03:00:21.889 --> 03:00:21.899 align:start position:0%
effectively manage the use of drones
 
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
while protecting the concerns of private
 
03:00:25.490 --> 03:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
landowners who open their trails to the
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
public the visitor experience and
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
privacy of citizens thank you for the
 
03:00:31.969 --> 03:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide the testimony and
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
pertinent information related to HB 434
 
03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
please let me know if I can answer any
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions or provide any additional
 
03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
questions or provide any additional
information

03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:44.690 --> 03:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:45.830 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
oh

03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:47.030 align:start position:0%
oh
okay

03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
all right representative gold followed
 
03:00:52.849 --> 03:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
by representative Horgan
 
03:00:55.130 --> 03:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
asked this question sooner but our
 
03:00:58.429 --> 03:00:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.090 --> 03:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
yes uh follow-up please for a follow-up
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:09.230 --> 03:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I could not answer that question I I
 
03:01:10.610 --> 03:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
think it's something that you can you
 
03:01:13.309 --> 03:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
can hear if it's obviously the lower it
 
03:01:16.130 --> 03:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
is or the larger the Drone is I think
 
03:01:18.290 --> 03:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
um uh more the closer the proximity to
 
03:01:20.750 --> 03:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
people if you you would hear it um if
 
03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
it's 400 feet in the air it's probably
 
03:01:26.030 --> 03:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
pretty unlikely or perhaps
 
03:01:30.110 --> 03:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
not very noticeable thank you
 
03:01:32.090 --> 03:01:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative Horton no
 
03:01:33.769 --> 03:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lamontagne and then
 
03:01:39.070 --> 03:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Darby for following
 
03:01:41.389 --> 03:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:01:41.399 --> 03:01:42.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
um

03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:45.590 --> 03:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the testimony submitted
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
um it says the bill was improved upon by
 
03:01:51.410 --> 03:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
applying only to state parks and not the
 
03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide trail system
 
03:01:56.510 --> 03:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
um but aren't most Trails don't they
 
03:01:58.969 --> 03:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
originate in state parks and how would
 
03:01:58.979 --> 03:01:59.750 align:start position:0%
originate in state parks and how would
you

03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:01.730 align:start position:0%
you
split

03:02:01.730 --> 03:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
split
 
03:02:01.740 --> 03:02:02.330 align:start position:0%
split
um

03:02:02.330 --> 03:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
how could you define that differently I
 
03:02:07.130 --> 03:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
don't see that in your testimony or in
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
the bill so yes there are a large most
 
03:02:14.269 --> 03:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
all of our state parks have Trail
 
03:02:16.790 --> 03:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
networks with within the parks
 
03:02:18.050 --> 03:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:02:21.769 --> 03:02:21.779 align:start position:0%
um it would be really impossible to
 
03:02:24.110 --> 03:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
separate drone use within a park from
 
03:02:27.230 --> 03:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
from trail trail users within a park
 
03:02:30.610 --> 03:02:30.620 align:start position:0%
there is Trail networks
 
03:02:34.429 --> 03:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
managed outside of State ownership as
 
03:02:36.290 --> 03:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
part of our Bureau of trails for
 
03:02:39.730 --> 03:02:39.740 align:start position:0%
primarily for ATV and
 
03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
ohrv usage which some is owned by the
 
03:02:45.290 --> 03:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
state but much of it is private land
 
03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
ownership and some of it is
 
03:02:50.990 --> 03:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
um it it gets very tricky to know you
 
03:02:53.150 --> 03:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
know if you're on a trail Corridor at
 
03:02:54.769 --> 03:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
times whether you're on private property
 
03:02:57.290 --> 03:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
or state property or otherwise
 
03:03:00.530 --> 03:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:02.690 --> 03:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative representative Darby for
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
a question
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:03:07.490 --> 03:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
um the bill states that there was a
 
03:03:12.650 --> 03:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
couple of places but yeah um where if
 
03:03:12.660 --> 03:03:13.730 align:start position:0%
couple of places but yeah um where if
the

03:03:13.730 --> 03:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:03:16.250 --> 03:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
um where if the Drone comes down and
 
03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's not cannot be retrieved by the
 
03:03:23.090 --> 03:03:23.100 align:start position:0%
um by launcher then there's a retrieval
 
03:03:25.790 --> 03:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
fee of a hundred dollars whether I think
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's both if it's lands from outside
 
03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
the park and I thought I saw some place
 
03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:31.130 align:start position:0%
the park and I thought I saw some place
it's

03:03:31.130 --> 03:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:03:32.750 --> 03:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
basically if it's if it can't be
 
03:03:35.150 --> 03:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
accessed it's not going to cost the 100
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
to retrieve it but um does that do you
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
would you
 
03:03:42.830 --> 03:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
um read that that it requires the
 
03:03:43.969 --> 03:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
um State Park
 
03:03:46.429 --> 03:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
um system to retrieve it for them for a
 
03:03:47.929 --> 03:03:47.939 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars even if that might
 
03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
require more than a hundred dollars to
 
03:03:50.690 --> 03:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
access it
 
03:03:53.389 --> 03:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
in labor or just to get it right
 
03:03:54.650 --> 03:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm just gonna just
 
03:03:56.929 --> 03:03:56.939 align:start position:0%
reference the the language here so I can
 
03:03:59.210 --> 03:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
try to respond to that
 
03:04:09.410 --> 03:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
um so I I read that as may be fined by
 
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner so that that
 
03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
um May affords us the the ability to do
 
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
so or not or or not is that the question
 
03:04:23.389 --> 03:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
sorry my question was like so you you
 
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't read that like you have to
 
03:04:27.889 --> 03:04:27.899 align:start position:0%
retrieve it um for a hundred dollars
 
03:04:32.990 --> 03:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:04:37.370 --> 03:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Veil
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
um would there be some kind of a
 
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
liability for retrieving a drone if it
 
03:04:48.590 --> 03:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
was needed to be so what I'm learning
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
about drones
 
03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna
 
03:04:53.929 --> 03:04:53.939 align:start position:0%
pretend I don't know anything it could
 
03:04:56.090 --> 03:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
be very small it could be very big it
 
03:04:57.769 --> 03:04:57.779 align:start position:0%
could be up in the sky very high it
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
could be down very low it could get
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
stuck somewhere the
 
03:05:04.670 --> 03:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
um the park system could fetch it for a
 
03:05:06.670 --> 03:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
03:05:10.610 --> 03:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
fee but is there liability for managing
 
03:05:13.130 --> 03:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
somebody else's equipment I mean once
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's down who owns it
 
03:05:17.630 --> 03:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
if it's on state property is it owned by
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
the land are these items insured I mean
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
what is the state's position on managing
 
03:05:25.550 --> 03:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
these kinds of vehicles because it is a
 
03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
vehicle as far as I know
 
03:05:32.090 --> 03:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
um I think that anything that is Left
 
03:05:37.969 --> 03:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
Behind or unretrieved is is considered
 
03:05:40.990 --> 03:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
um litter essentially
 
03:05:46.490 --> 03:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
regardless of of of its uh operability
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and our our staff would have to take
 
03:05:53.450 --> 03:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
a uh you know an informed approach as to
 
03:05:53.460 --> 03:05:54.769 align:start position:0%
a uh you know an informed approach as to
whether

03:05:54.769 --> 03:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:05:56.690 --> 03:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
viable to even you know retrieve it if
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's you know underwater or an
 
03:06:03.889 --> 03:06:03.899 align:start position:0%
inaccessible or dangerous location that
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something that we would seek
 
03:06:11.929 --> 03:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
03:06:13.979 --> 03:06:16.429 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
this anybody
 
03:06:20.450 --> 03:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:06:24.769 --> 03:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
thank you this I thought I saw a move
 
03:06:24.779 --> 03:06:30.010 align:start position:0%
thank you this I thought I saw a move
pardon

03:06:30.010 --> 03:06:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:34.190 --> 03:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but sure why not try it
 
03:06:36.410 --> 03:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
try it you'll like it
 
03:06:39.230 --> 03:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about
 
03:06:44.210 --> 03:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.610 --> 03:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
flyer can be given
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
a license like a hunter
 
03:06:51.230 --> 03:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
to fly a drone
 
03:06:53.090 --> 03:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
and that you could set a limit on the
 
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
number of
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
drone Pilots
 
03:06:57.359 --> 03:07:00.349 align:start position:0%
drone Pilots
seasonally

03:07:00.349 --> 03:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
seasonally
 
03:07:02.650 --> 03:07:02.660 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines to
 
03:07:08.450 --> 03:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
hobby profession
 
03:07:15.849 --> 03:07:15.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:20.090 --> 03:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
myth was our question questions about
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
license I guess yeah you you may want I
 
03:07:26.030 --> 03:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
don't know we do have somebody from the
 
03:07:29.570 --> 03:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
Bureau of uh dot Bureau of Aeronautics
 
03:07:32.990 --> 03:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer that question a
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
little bit better well when she comes up
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a yes so save it save that
 
03:07:42.650 --> 03:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
question so I I will I'll you know what
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
I can say is that we currently do allow
 
03:07:47.450 --> 03:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
through our special use perm permit
 
03:07:47.460 --> 03:07:49.190 align:start position:0%
through our special use perm permit
process

03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:07:51.650 --> 03:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
um consideration for for commercial use
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
so we we can and and do allow that and
 
03:07:58.429 --> 03:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
and entertain uh those uses and permit
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
those uses I think the recreational com
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
side of it it would be a
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
speculative to to Really gauge you know
 
03:08:09.530 --> 03:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
what the the interest level would be and
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
and how to uh to to manage that
 
03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:14.809 align:start position:0%
and how to uh to to manage that
appropriately

03:08:14.809 --> 03:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh see no more questions someone
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
looking to question I will uh you know
 
03:08:26.590 --> 03:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll ask you to
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh let's see Kate
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
sheets uh you support the bill
 
03:08:37.969 --> 03:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
uh had not put down the way you want us
 
03:08:45.730 --> 03:08:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.530 --> 03:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
you're not looking to speak
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
because I there was a card
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
submitted and you if not I'll just go on
 
03:08:56.040 --> 03:08:58.190 align:start position:0%
submitted and you if not I'll just go on
but

03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:09:00.530 --> 03:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
you'd have to use the microphone so it
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:19.849 --> 03:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
hi hi my name is Kate sheets
 
03:09:22.130 --> 03:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm here with my family
 
03:09:25.010 --> 03:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm from Ellsworth thank you for
 
03:09:26.750 --> 03:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
hearing me
 
03:09:31.730 --> 03:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
um so our family has uh spent a lot of
 
03:09:34.610 --> 03:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
time uh recreationally in the White
 
03:09:36.290 --> 03:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
Mountains we live
 
03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:37.070 align:start position:0%
Mountains we live
um

03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:40.969 --> 03:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
right next to the border of the national
 
03:09:43.750 --> 03:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
forest and
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
we've kind of looked into
 
03:09:47.520 --> 03:09:48.050 align:start position:0%
we've kind of looked into
um

03:09:48.050 --> 03:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:50.570 --> 03:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
drones and the and their future
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
essentially and our children's Futures
 
03:09:55.969 --> 03:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
and if you even if you just look on you
 
03:09:59.570 --> 03:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
know indeed a lot of the jobs in in you
 
03:10:02.929 --> 03:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
know that are listed in science require
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
or you know ask for
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of drone piloting so
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
it occurred to me at some point well we
 
03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
should probably look into this and again
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of our time hiking and
 
03:10:20.809 --> 03:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
walking and you know playing in the in
 
03:10:24.769 --> 03:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
the forest so this bill to me it looks
 
03:10:26.690 --> 03:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean and and so I'm a gardener I
 
03:10:30.769 --> 03:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
like to be in the quiet I don't like to
 
03:10:32.210 --> 03:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:10:34.849 --> 03:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
be in front of a computer so it is
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
something I'm really interested in
 
03:10:40.250 --> 03:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you know watching
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
kind of evolve the um the use of of
 
03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
drones in society
 
03:10:50.210 --> 03:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
that's all any questions from members of
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:56.690 --> 03:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the person with you this you want to
 
03:10:56.700 --> 03:10:58.870 align:start position:0%
and the person with you this you want to
testify

03:10:58.870 --> 03:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%

03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing oh okay sorry I missed you

which is RSA 422
 
03:11:50.399 --> 03:11:51.230 align:start position:0%
which is RSA 422
um

03:11:51.230 --> 03:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:53.929 --> 03:11:53.939 align:start position:0%
with that drones
 
03:11:53.939 --> 03:11:55.550 align:start position:0%
with that drones
which

03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:11:58.309 --> 03:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
most people call them and I have given
 
03:12:00.349 --> 03:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
up because that's what we call them but
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
they're really unmanned aircraft
 
03:12:04.730 --> 03:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
or Ant-Man aircraft system in fact the
 
03:12:04.740 --> 03:12:05.690 align:start position:0%
or Ant-Man aircraft system in fact the
last

03:12:05.690 --> 03:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:12:07.610 --> 03:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
um it's been about eight years I've
 
03:12:09.170 --> 03:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
testified before many committees
 
03:12:13.250 --> 03:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
regarding uas because it's new and
 
03:12:15.230 --> 03:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
people are curious or they want to know
 
03:12:19.730 --> 03:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
is it good is it bad we spent I spent
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
about three years just trying to get
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
definitions through which now are
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
currently in RSA 422.
 
03:12:32.889 --> 03:12:32.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:37.150 --> 03:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
Aviation is a wonderful safe
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
activity not for just transporting of
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
people and goods but also for
 
03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:43.309 align:start position:0%
people and goods but also for
um

03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
a industry like uas that children
 
03:12:49.730 --> 03:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
truthfully are going to be taking part
 
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
in and it's not new anymore everybody
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
says oh it's this new industry it's not
 
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
new anymore and I think we're slowly
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
trying to adapt to them being in our
 
03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
lives and how best to integrate them
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so we as the Department of
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation Bureau of Aeronautics we
 
03:13:07.370 --> 03:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
are supportive and not only supportive
 
03:13:09.530 --> 03:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
but we actually promote that
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we have drones ourselves
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
um we have everything from a small one
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
that can go through a
 
03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:17.330 align:start position:0%
that can go through a
um

03:13:17.330 --> 03:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:17.340 --> 03:13:18.710 align:start position:0%
um
um

03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:21.050 --> 03:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh sorry we have we have small ones that
 
03:13:23.389 --> 03:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
can do that can go in small areas all
 
03:13:25.790 --> 03:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
the way up to a large
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
um one that we spoke about commercial
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just for the for making movies
 
03:13:32.450 --> 03:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
we use it within the department we just
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
flew it out over Rye to look at the sea
 
03:13:37.370 --> 03:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
wall and we had a gentleman there that
 
03:13:39.650 --> 03:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
did that pretty much all day trying to
 
03:13:42.110 --> 03:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
get data and we use that data and it's
 
03:13:45.769 --> 03:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
fast it's safe and it
 
03:13:45.779 --> 03:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
fast it's safe and it
um

03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:48.889 --> 03:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
it's a lot less expensive than doing it
 
03:13:50.809 --> 03:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
the regular the other way of surveying
 
03:13:50.819 --> 03:13:51.769 align:start position:0%
the regular the other way of surveying
way

03:13:51.769 --> 03:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:13:54.290 --> 03:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
so with that said
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
um with somewhat reluctance I am
 
03:13:59.450 --> 03:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill but only because
 
03:14:00.769 --> 03:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
um the technicalities and how it's
 
03:14:00.779 --> 03:14:01.730 align:start position:0%
um the technicalities and how it's
written

03:14:01.730 --> 03:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:14:03.530 --> 03:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
um right off the top it mentions that
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
you're it's a drone and under current
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
state statute it's a uas and I think
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
someone had asked the question about
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
well which ones are we talking about are
 
03:14:15.290 --> 03:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
we talking about small large I believe
 
03:14:16.910 --> 03:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are three definitions in there and
 
03:14:19.370 --> 03:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
they relate back to the federal law and
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's to keep it so because it's it's
 
03:14:23.330 --> 03:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
changing and we did that so that we
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
would always be lined up with the
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
federal law so that answers that's the
 
03:14:29.389 --> 03:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
first issue
 
03:14:29.399 --> 03:14:31.070 align:start position:0%
first issue
um

03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:33.650 --> 03:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
let me check my notes Here
 
03:14:33.660 --> 03:14:35.330 align:start position:0%
let me check my notes Here
so

03:14:35.330 --> 03:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:37.370 --> 03:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
the second the second note that I have
 
03:14:42.050 --> 03:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
that um may be an issue is I I think
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
the airspace is is federal
 
03:14:46.910 --> 03:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
um it's federally controlled
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
um people can debate that you know
 
03:14:50.330 --> 03:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
whether you have space over your house
 
03:14:53.450 --> 03:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
the FAA is still standing strong that
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
they own the airspace
 
03:14:58.490 --> 03:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
so when you start getting into well you
 
03:15:00.410 --> 03:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
can launch from here but you need to
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
know whether it has
 
03:15:04.910 --> 03:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
an issue dealing with Canon mountain or
 
03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:06.590 align:start position:0%
an issue dealing with Canon mountain or
interferes

03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
interferes
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how you police that because
 
03:15:10.610 --> 03:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
even if you didn't take off from that
 
03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:11.630 align:start position:0%
even if you didn't take off from that
spot

03:15:11.630 --> 03:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
spot
 
03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:13.010 align:start position:0%
spot
that

03:15:13.010 --> 03:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
whether the parks let you or not
 
03:15:16.730 --> 03:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
somebody could still fly in that space
 
03:15:20.450 --> 03:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
because it's it's airspace for all
 
03:15:23.690 --> 03:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
unless it's federally
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
um shut down
 
03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
so I I sort of feel that falls into that
 
03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
because I don't know how the park
 
03:15:33.490 --> 03:15:33.500 align:start position:0%
service is going to be able to to
 
03:15:36.769 --> 03:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
determine whether that is they can fly
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
there or not it's you know whether it's
 
03:15:40.910 --> 03:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue
 
03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:43.849 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue
the

03:15:43.849 --> 03:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
second part I think it's very clear that
 
03:15:49.490 --> 03:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
the state has the ability or anybody who
 
03:15:51.469 --> 03:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
owns property has the right to determine
 
03:15:53.929 --> 03:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
whether they can take off it's take off
 
03:15:55.250 --> 03:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
for landing and I think that's what the
 
03:15:57.889 --> 03:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is trying to do
 
03:16:00.889 --> 03:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
um but again once you start saying where
 
03:16:02.750 --> 03:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot fly I think that's
 
03:16:04.190 --> 03:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
where it crosses over into Federal
 
03:16:04.200 --> 03:16:06.410 align:start position:0%
where it crosses over into Federal
preemption

03:16:06.410 --> 03:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
preemption
 
03:16:09.230 --> 03:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
there's a section on the aircraft
 
03:16:09.240 --> 03:16:11.269 align:start position:0%
there's a section on the aircraft
insurance

03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
aircraft in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
it was repealed some time ago I
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't have the time frame
 
03:16:17.450 --> 03:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
but it was before my time and I've been
 
03:16:19.370 --> 03:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
here 23 years
 
03:16:21.410 --> 03:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement for insurance
 
03:16:24.230 --> 03:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
for an aircraft this is an aircraft this
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
is a registered aircraft with the
 
03:16:28.190 --> 03:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
federal government and it has a number
 
03:16:32.269 --> 03:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
so that makes it different than a moped
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
it makes it different than your car
 
03:16:35.269 --> 03:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
because it is under the federal
 
03:16:35.279 --> 03:16:36.530 align:start position:0%
because it is under the federal
jurisdiction

03:16:36.530 --> 03:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
so however the state had the right to
 
03:16:40.610 --> 03:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
determine whether they wanted to put
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
insurance and right now as it stands
 
03:16:43.730 --> 03:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
there is none
 
03:16:47.710 --> 03:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.809 --> 03:16:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.819 --> 03:16:56.269 align:start position:0%
 
privacy

03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
03:16:58.250 --> 03:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
I think this is an unintended slippery
 
03:17:01.010 --> 03:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
slope in the sense that again I have
 
03:17:04.190 --> 03:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
testified many times where
 
03:17:06.050 --> 03:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know we have our phones and we
 
03:17:07.730 --> 03:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
talked about I'm sure that it was went
 
03:17:10.130 --> 03:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
through privacy issues and how do you
 
03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
control the phone this is yet another
 
03:17:14.929 --> 03:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
a piece of equipment that is very
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
similar to your phone in fact they can
 
03:17:18.490 --> 03:17:18.500 align:start position:0%
hang the phone from it
 
03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
and I believe privacy we feel privacy is
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
covered under RSA 644
 
03:17:28.010 --> 03:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
currently as it speaks right now it
 
03:17:29.570 --> 03:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter whether you're on a
 
03:17:31.309 --> 03:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
ladder up to somebody's house or using a
 
03:17:33.070 --> 03:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
drone or using your phone on the street
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
that is we feel is already covered for
 
03:17:37.849 --> 03:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
that so we don't want drones to become
 
03:17:40.429 --> 03:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
this special piece of equipment
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
like your phone so phones currently I
 
03:17:47.210 --> 03:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:47.220 --> 03:17:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:17:48.410 --> 03:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's a section in here that talks
 
03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
about charging fees to take off
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
you can charge a landing fee or takeoff
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
fee that's fine but the way it's written
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's being charged for the
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
flight and again you're charging someone
 
03:18:03.429 --> 03:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
to fly
 
03:18:06.050 --> 03:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
I believe that there's jurisdictional
 
03:18:08.090 --> 03:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
possible jurisdictional issues there
 
03:18:10.250 --> 03:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
03:18:12.190 --> 03:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
through between
 
03:18:14.809 --> 03:18:14.819 align:start position:0%
State agencies or even potentially with
 
03:18:17.210 --> 03:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
the FAA
 
03:18:20.809 --> 03:18:20.819 align:start position:0%
so I I would say that because currently
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
right now the Department of
 
03:18:24.349 --> 03:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
Transportation has its own fee structure
 
03:18:27.230 --> 03:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
for all Aviation activities with the
 
03:18:29.929 --> 03:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
hearings hearings board and all those
 
03:18:31.550 --> 03:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
things and so I'm not sure whether that
 
03:18:33.889 --> 03:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
would fall under that and again it's
 
03:18:35.809 --> 03:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
carrying the jurisdiction over to the
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
parks which they can they can set their
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
own policy but not as it relates to the
 
03:18:41.990 --> 03:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
flight aspect of it
 
03:18:45.050 --> 03:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
that that is my take on it
 
03:18:48.230 --> 03:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:54.290 --> 03:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
I guess so on a smaller point is that
 
03:18:57.530 --> 03:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
there are going to be uas's that have
 
03:18:59.450 --> 03:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
emergency Landings and so there's a fee
 
03:19:01.969 --> 03:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
structure as a part of that
 
03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
um eight Pilots should have the right to
 
03:19:07.969 --> 03:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
successfully have an emergency landing
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
put it where it needs to be in a safe
 
03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
spot and not have the fear of a fine but
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
again that's that's a little bit
 
03:19:16.730 --> 03:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
Crossing out of our jurisdiction but I
 
03:19:19.370 --> 03:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
thought I'd make the point
 
03:19:22.010 --> 03:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
think that's all I have if there's any
 
03:19:26.809 --> 03:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:19:29.929 --> 03:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you just repeat
 
03:19:32.570 --> 03:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
the the point that you're trying to make
 
03:19:35.090 --> 03:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
around privacy the unintended slippery
 
03:19:35.100 --> 03:19:36.349 align:start position:0%
around privacy the unintended slippery
slope

03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
slope
 
03:19:39.050 --> 03:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
there currently is a law
 
03:19:42.769 --> 03:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
RSA 644 that addresses privacy
 
03:19:44.690 --> 03:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
03:19:44.700 --> 03:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
across the board
so

03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:49.969 --> 03:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
my experience in different
 
03:19:53.330 --> 03:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
hearings is that if you you're now
 
03:19:55.190 --> 03:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
adding in
 
03:19:58.370 --> 03:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how you
 
03:19:58.380 --> 03:19:59.510 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how you
um

03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:01.610 --> 03:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
impact someone's privacy whether you use
 
03:20:03.769 --> 03:20:03.779 align:start position:0%
a ladder to climb up their house whether
 
03:20:06.290 --> 03:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
using a phone it's another piece of
 
03:20:08.929 --> 03:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
equipment and it falls under that
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
privacy statute whether if you're using
 
03:20:13.969 --> 03:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
a drone and you're peeping in somebody's
 
03:20:16.190 --> 03:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
to look at their mail
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
it would fall under 644 and that's what
 
03:20:19.969 --> 03:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
we would we would
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
send the person back to the police to to
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:26.279 --> 03:20:27.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:20:27.610 --> 03:20:27.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:31.130 --> 03:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh anyone else have any questions on the
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:38.990 --> 03:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question thanks for pointing
 
03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
out uh the
 
03:20:44.809 --> 03:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
the the Drone and the small unmanned
 
03:20:47.870 --> 03:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
aircraft definition that's in 422. so
 
03:20:50.330 --> 03:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
would you agree that
 
03:20:52.610 --> 03:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
in this draft
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
um the use of drone and small on
 
03:20:57.170 --> 03:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
unmanned aircraft is sufficient because
 
03:20:59.929 --> 03:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
it's in 422 so in this draft
 
03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
it would it would suffice I'm sorry it
 
03:21:05.389 --> 03:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
was hard yeah I'm sorry that's okay
 
03:21:07.610 --> 03:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
so thanks for pointing out that in 422
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
small unmanned aircraft is in fact
 
03:21:12.170 --> 03:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
defined so in this draft it I mean do we
 
03:21:13.790 --> 03:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
need to amend it so it refers to it
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
because I see in 422 that small unmanned
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
aircraft is defined and it's exactly
 
03:21:22.849 --> 03:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
referred to in this draft it is referred
 
03:21:24.050 --> 03:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
to I may
 
03:21:25.730 --> 03:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
have anything they're using drones at
 
03:21:27.769 --> 03:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
the top which tells you it's
 
03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's the incorrect terminology which
 
03:21:31.969 --> 03:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
could be confusing
 
03:21:34.610 --> 03:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
all right thanks thank you Mr Sherman so
 
03:21:36.530 --> 03:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
in line three it says a drone or small
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
unmanned aircraft and you mentioned that
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
in 422 it's defined so thank you for
 
03:21:42.590 --> 03:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
that good work of four years of getting
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
those definitions in 422 23A
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.889 --> 03:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
maybe in line three if we had a work
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
session it could be clarified a little
 
03:22:01.730 --> 03:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
bit but I think you're correct it says a
 
03:22:04.010 --> 03:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
drone or small unmanned aircraft which
 
03:22:08.170 --> 03:22:08.180 align:start position:0%
is the same as RS RSA 420 to
 
03:22:11.150 --> 03:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
27A there's I think there's three
 
03:22:13.849 --> 03:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
different ones um yes the answer to your
 
03:22:15.889 --> 03:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
question is yes I would reference back
 
03:22:18.349 --> 03:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
to that so that that and I would remove
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
drone I would use UA whatever whatever
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
you're referencing and I would also
 
03:22:22.439 --> 03:22:24.230 align:start position:0%
you're referencing and I would also
Define

03:22:24.230 --> 03:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
Define
 
03:22:26.210 --> 03:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
um more clearly what drones we're using
 
03:22:33.410 --> 03:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.630 --> 03:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
know for a little tiny little tiny
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
little follow-up right so would you be
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
willing to help in a work session to
 
03:22:41.090 --> 03:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
tweak that little language to maybe
 
03:22:44.210 --> 03:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
really get it get it right and work with
 
03:22:46.010 --> 03:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
your department to find it I'll even do
 
03:22:47.929 --> 03:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
one better if there's ever anyone that
 
03:22:50.690 --> 03:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
would like to see them operate
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
we have them we have like I said we have
 
03:22:54.530 --> 03:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
them from the small to the large I think
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
that sometimes there's
 
03:22:59.630 --> 03:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
not an understanding of what they are
 
03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
um we have a gentleman that applies them
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:23:13.969 --> 03:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
seeing no one thing can I um I don't
 
03:23:14.990 --> 03:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
know if I need to answer the
 
03:23:17.210 --> 03:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
registration part I I think there was a
 
03:23:19.309 --> 03:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
question earlier
 
03:23:22.510 --> 03:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
would you like me to answer I don't know
 
03:23:24.950 --> 03:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative was that yours it was
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
more about licensing yeah
 
03:23:30.769 --> 03:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
So currently we do not license them in
 
03:23:32.590 --> 03:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
the state they pay an FAA registration
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
we do register aircraft manned aircraft
 
03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
along with the federal the federal have
 
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
a registration and we register so you we
 
03:23:43.910 --> 03:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
can read we are currently not
 
03:23:46.490 --> 03:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
registering at this time so
 
03:23:48.349 --> 03:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
um where you we don't have access to the
 
03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal database a lot of that is
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
because there are minors on that
 
03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:53.450 align:start position:0%
because there are minors on that
database

03:23:53.450 --> 03:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
database
 
03:23:53.460 --> 03:23:54.650 align:start position:0%
database
okay

03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:23:58.729 --> 03:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
that's it oh you got one more okay
 
03:23:58.739 --> 03:24:01.150 align:start position:0%
that's it oh you got one more okay
Lamontagne

03:24:01.150 --> 03:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
Lamontagne
 
03:24:04.849 --> 03:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for checking my question
 
03:24:07.250 --> 03:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
um could you just explain a little bit
 
03:24:08.809 --> 03:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
for me because I really don't know much
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
about drones and when you talk about
 
03:24:10.680 --> 03:24:12.769 align:start position:0%
about drones and when you talk about
Aerospace

03:24:12.769 --> 03:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
Aerospace
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and like where you take off and where
 
03:24:17.330 --> 03:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
how how does that apply just anywhere
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
flying down the street I like where do
 
03:24:26.929 --> 03:24:26.939 align:start position:0%
you distinguish between where you're in
 
03:24:29.450 --> 03:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
public airspace and and when you're
 
03:24:29.460 --> 03:24:31.010 align:start position:0%
public airspace and and when you're
invading

03:24:31.010 --> 03:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
invading
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh people's privacy if like where where
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
are people flying drones or unmanned
 
03:24:39.769 --> 03:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
aircraft all right so that's a really
 
03:24:43.130 --> 03:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
loaded question but I'll do my best so
 
03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:44.090 align:start position:0%
loaded question but I'll do my best so
um

03:24:44.090 --> 03:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
the FAA for manned aircraft has always
 
03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:48.229 align:start position:0%
the FAA for manned aircraft has always
had

03:24:48.229 --> 03:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
different types of airspace I can go
 
03:24:52.969 --> 03:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
through and list them all but with
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
requirements to be in certain airplanes
 
03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
certain air space meaning you know you
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
have to talk to somebody or traffic
 
03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
control so Manchester has controlled
 
03:25:04.969 --> 03:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
what we call controlled airspace for the
 
03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
uas when they came along
 
03:25:09.650 --> 03:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
um FAA had to scramble to try to figure
 
03:25:11.690 --> 03:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
out how to integrate these smaller
 
03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can't see them
 
03:25:16.969 --> 03:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
aircraft into the system and they have
 
03:25:18.349 --> 03:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
done that
 
03:25:19.729 --> 03:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell you at Concord airport
 
03:25:22.729 --> 03:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
there's they call it Lance I don't I
 
03:25:24.530 --> 03:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
can't I can't tell you exactly what all
 
03:25:27.410 --> 03:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
the acronyms are but it they
 
03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
um lay this over the airspace and they
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
have little grids and that can tell you
 
03:25:33.650 --> 03:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
whether you can fly your drone whether
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's the first 200 feet first hundred
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
feet some go right to the zero down to
 
03:25:39.650 --> 03:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
zero which means you can't fly it there
 
03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:40.849 align:start position:0%
zero which means you can't fly it there
without

03:25:40.849 --> 03:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:25:43.130 --> 03:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
certain types of permissions
 
03:25:44.929 --> 03:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
so that's how they're controlling that
 
03:25:48.170 --> 03:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
as far as over your house that is a much
 
03:25:51.370 --> 03:25:51.380 align:start position:0%
bigger conversation I think it's been
 
03:25:55.250 --> 03:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
I can't recall the lawsuit but I think a
 
03:25:57.410 --> 03:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
farmer had fought for that very reason
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
like I should have at least some amount
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
over my house
 
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say that's to be
 
03:26:05.570 --> 03:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
determined I think that that is still
 
03:26:09.170 --> 03:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
being worked on as far as whether you
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
can have a drone if a drone is flying
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
right outside your window I probably
 
03:26:14.990 --> 03:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
would use 644 and say someone's trying
 
03:26:16.729 --> 03:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
to to look in my house because it's so
 
03:26:16.739 --> 03:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
to to look in my house because it's so
close

03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
close
 
03:26:19.790 --> 03:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
again that's to be determined depending
 
03:26:21.349 --> 03:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
on that circumstance I'm not an attorney
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm certainly not law enforcement
 
03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
did that answer question it's it's a
 
03:26:29.330 --> 03:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
mixed bag
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
um but there is it's there's controlled
 
03:26:33.769 --> 03:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
and uncontrolled airspace per the FAA it
 
03:26:36.590 --> 03:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
answers a question thank you
 
03:26:39.969 --> 03:26:39.979 align:start position:0%
uh no one else
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much and the final
 
03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
Paul Nickerson
 
03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.290 --> 03:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
from the Audubon Society
 
03:26:59.929 --> 03:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I see you could
 
03:27:02.269 --> 03:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
read it this time yes that's right you'd
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
use the other very careful to write it
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
out I figured you used the other hand
 
03:27:07.969 --> 03:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't help
 
03:27:07.979 --> 03:27:09.530 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't help
yeah

03:27:09.530 --> 03:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:27:12.530 --> 03:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
you'll find my testimony this time I
 
03:27:14.570 --> 03:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
won't be quite as opinionated as I was
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
about the dog issue
 
03:27:18.650 --> 03:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
and as I go through it I think you'll
 
03:27:20.210 --> 03:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
see why
 
03:27:24.410 --> 03:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna confine my remarks to what we
 
03:27:27.229 --> 03:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
do Audubon work on New Hampshire's
 
03:27:27.239 --> 03:27:28.250 align:start position:0%
do Audubon work on New Hampshire's
wildlife

03:27:28.250 --> 03:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
03:27:30.769 --> 03:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
and the effect both positive and
 
03:27:33.370 --> 03:27:33.380 align:start position:0%
negative that drones may have on on
 
03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
Wildlife first the positive
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
Wildlife biologists are increasingly
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
finding uses for drones such as to
 
03:27:43.849 --> 03:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
monitor Wildlife populations in areas
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to access or count animals
 
03:27:49.130 --> 03:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
that congregate in large groups like elk
 
03:27:51.769 --> 03:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
bison and so forth but
 
03:27:54.050 --> 03:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
when they do this is trained researchers
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
who are specifically monitoring the
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
animal's behavior and subject to
 
03:28:00.110 --> 03:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines designed to avoid disturbance
 
03:28:01.910 --> 03:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the subject animals and there's some
 
03:28:03.650 --> 03:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
references here
 
03:28:05.630 --> 03:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife service and the forest
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
service both have provided guidelines
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
for drone use on their lands and they go
 
03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
back several years
 
03:28:13.370 --> 03:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of recreational
 
03:28:15.650 --> 03:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
users are not going to be aware that
 
03:28:17.929 --> 03:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
such guidelines exist or are aware of
 
03:28:19.729 --> 03:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
the presence of sensitive species near
 
03:28:19.739 --> 03:28:21.590 align:start position:0%
the presence of sensitive species near
trails

03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
trails
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the negative
 
03:28:25.849 --> 03:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
numerous instances of recreational
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
drones causing serious disturbance to
 
03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
nesting Birds
 
03:28:32.269 --> 03:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
drones have caused bald eagles to
 
03:28:34.490 --> 03:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
abandon their nests in Arizona and have
 
03:28:36.769 --> 03:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
caused Colony abandonment of elegant
 
03:28:39.530 --> 03:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
turns and other shorebird species
 
03:28:41.389 --> 03:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
drones are also being used to deter
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
birds from areas of human Wildlife
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
conflict which may be positive and may
 
03:28:49.849 --> 03:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
we feel before the legislature grants
 
03:28:55.010 --> 03:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
authorization for drone use within state
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
parks is a need for stakeholders
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
including Fish and Game to discuss risks
 
03:29:03.530 --> 03:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
and potential need for regulations such
 
03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
as should there be seasonal limitations
 
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
to avoid disturbing nesting birds or
 
03:29:10.849 --> 03:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
wintering deer herds
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
should some parks be off limits due to
 
03:29:15.769 --> 03:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
their proximity to sensitive species
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
such as bald eagles peregrine falcons
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
two of our big success stories by the
 
03:29:21.650 --> 03:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
way in New Hampshire's I'm sure you know
 
03:29:24.769 --> 03:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
both those species were going or almost
 
03:29:27.050 --> 03:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
gone and now they've been restored
 
03:29:29.330 --> 03:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
a great blue heron colonies
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
what guidelines should be promoted for
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
drone use in New Hampshire
 
03:29:35.929 --> 03:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
what kinds of educational Outreach
 
03:29:37.610 --> 03:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
should be undertaken and should permits
 
03:29:39.290 --> 03:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
be required for use for drones and
 
03:29:41.330 --> 03:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Research
 
03:29:44.090 --> 03:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
in view of this the both the beneficial
 
03:29:46.130 --> 03:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
and the detrimental effects we urge that
 
03:29:50.450 --> 03:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
you refer hb434 to interim study until a
 
03:29:52.010 --> 03:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
thoughtful discussion of these questions
 
03:29:54.050 --> 03:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
among other topics that are likely to
 
03:29:55.790 --> 03:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
arise can occur
 
03:29:58.729 --> 03:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:00.910 --> 03:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:30:05.570 --> 03:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
having no one there's no one else that's
 
03:30:11.090 --> 03:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
having no more pink cards if someone
 
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
else wishes to speak
 
03:30:14.929 --> 03:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
I will
 
03:30:14.939 --> 03:30:16.370 align:start position:0%
I will
go

03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:30:18.950 --> 03:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
I will uh
 
03:30:23.170 --> 03:30:23.180 align:start position:0%
call in the hearing uh we all spill for
 
03:30:25.849 --> 03:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
438 four
 
03:30:29.929 --> 03:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
and also I will say
 
03:30:35.090 --> 03:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
we have a meeting with the Des at 1 30
 
03:30:37.210 --> 03:30:37.220 align:start position:0%
at 29
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh Haze and drive you're aware of that
 
03:30:45.889 --> 03:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we're a 29 Hazen Drive
 
03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
is you know where Hazen Drive is to
 
03:30:49.070 --> 03:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
start with
 
03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
just go get your yeah you can get your
 
03:30:53.150 --> 03:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
plates there
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
right was that but it's not that in the
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
same not in the same spot it's 29 it's
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
not near uh uh H uh it's HHS
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
he hates the Health and Human Services
 
03:31:05.520 --> 03:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
he hates the Health and Human Services
building

03:31:07.190 --> 03:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:31:09.229 --> 03:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
