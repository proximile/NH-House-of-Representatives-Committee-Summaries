00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
Committee HB 733 FN all right this is
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
new legislation we haven't seen it
 
00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:41.879 align:start position:0%
before up here at the State House this
 
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
is something that's uh going across the
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
states here in the US so let's get into
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
it what is tlf or thirdparty litigation
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
financing it is when an investor helps
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
finance a lawsuit in which the investor
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
has no personal stake
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
at the moment parties involved in tplf
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
Agreements are not required to disclose
 
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
Agreements are not required to disclose
these

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
actions so defendants and courts do not
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
know the presence or identity of the
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
funders as real parties with financial
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
interest in the
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
case lenders who engage in tlf are
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
largely unregulated and as a result tplf
 
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
attracts hedge funds to participate in
 
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
litigation financers because the
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
industry is not subject to the same
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
limitations and Regulatory oversight as
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
normal consumer
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
loans this avoids critical consumer
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
protection oversights which is why the
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
bill landed in this committee it also
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
attracts outside financers such as
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
foreign entities influencing lawsuits do
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
you want to take a the look at the law
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
on page number
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
say I want to point out lines 9 through
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
28 and that's dealing with the foreign
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
entities I know represent spear had a
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
question about the governor and that's
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
where it's it that's where it lands in
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
this bill that's just part of the
 
00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
definition yep since you're looking
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
me I know what it is and we're not
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
taking questions oh okay let him finish
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
me all
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
right litigation abuse is notable factor
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
causing an upward pressure on insurance
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
costs and it's only getting worse across
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
the country and right here in New
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is known as a tort tax
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sure someone behind me can
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
explain a Tor tax much better than I can
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
they could be more eloquent about it but
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's basically causing upward pressures
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
of 15 to
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
20% in the
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuits one way the states have begun
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
to combat such abuse is through the TPL
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
of transparency laws I've attached a
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
list of these states to the packet that
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
I handed out to you that have already
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
passed laws or the court rules and it's
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
part of my testimony so working with
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
Miss NATO and Mr leine we decided base
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
our legislation on the en coil model
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
that was released late last year so
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this this whole bill is
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
modeled after tplf is estimated to be a
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
400 billion billion with a B Global
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
industry it's essentially turning our
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
Civil Justice System into another
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
commodity for investors to make
 
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.870 align:start position:0%
commodity for investors to make
exorbitant

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
exorbitant
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
profits to ensure a high rate of return
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
on its investment the fun seeks to
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood of a trust trial
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
thus enhancing the possibility of
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
frivolous and misguided legislation or
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
litigation I'm Sorry by turning the
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
Civil Justice System into a money-making
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
machine tplf discourages amicable
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
settlements of disputes and instead
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
encourages aggressive and prolonged
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
litigation of marginal or frivolous
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
claims this again adds to the state's
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
already significant tort tax on
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
households it drives up the cost of
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
products services and
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
Insurance states have started to en
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
enact tplf transparency laws to protect
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
the fair and efficient administration of
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
justice this includes legislation that
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
requires Common Sense guard rails around
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
the use of tplf including funding
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
prohibitions so again if I can ask you
 
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
to turn a page number six in the law or
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
written page number six lines 20 through
 
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
37 then on to page seven all the way
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
through 26 that's dealing with all those
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
guard rails that we're putting in for
 
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.190 align:start position:0%
guard rails that we're putting in for
Consumer

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
Consumer
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
afterwards and then the mandatory
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
disclosure of the tplf Agreements are on
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
page number nine so if you want to take
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
a quick look at page number nine just
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
point those out to you real quickly as
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
well that's on lines 10 through 17
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's only three reporting
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
requirements it's not an exorbitant
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
thing that we're asking to be done here
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
okay discoverability of these
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
arrangements and lawsuits and state
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
level regulation of funders is the main
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill by requiring
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
disclosure of tplf to parties in
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
litigation and the courts balance can be
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
restored to legal system and the related
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
increased product service and insurance
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
costs associated with us will be reduced
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony now I have two
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
things that we need to do a little house
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
cleaning on this uh turning Scher
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
brought it up to my
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
attention so we need to add a word
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
knowingly at the very end and we left
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
out a section that we had originally in
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
there I sent you this one page I gave it
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
all to you this one page this needs to
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
be incorporated bill at a later date but
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
he understands that where we are going
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
to put it into the
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
bill and with that I'll take any
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
questions if you have
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so getting to the what we were
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
talking about I know what the CFR 791 is
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
and I know the countries that are in it
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
around but I looked at the Constitution
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
and I can't find any place in the
 
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution that says the governor has
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
the right to declare another
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
country to be a threat to our
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so where where are we
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
getting that
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
from I don't know it's another country I
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
think it's more of an entity or an
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
entity from another country although one
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
country or a country designated as a
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
threat to critical infrastructure and
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
what criteria would they use and where
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
did they get the right to do that and
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's not in the New Hampshire
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
Constitution that they have the right to
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
do that so I would like you to look at
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
that a little bit okay we can look at
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
that I'll have the lawyers look at that
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
too yeah so where is that uh page on the
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
new bill on the new uh amendments page
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
three around lines seven and eight
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
11 of a code of federal regulations or a
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
country designated as a threat to
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
critical infrastructure by the governor
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
by written notice of the Department of
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
Safety so I think it's the department of
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
safety that's making that determination
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
and passing
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
this is under definition this is under
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
definitions yeah but then it but
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the document it calls out a
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
person or country of concern and the
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
definition of a personal country of
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
concern is somebody designated by the
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
governor among other things okay so who
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
should who should be someone who decides
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
that it better than the Govern I have no
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
problem with CFR
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
791 but I don't think the governor has
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
any right to say or even knows who is a
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
threat what country is a threat to our
 
00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:00.629 align:start position:0%
threat what country is a threat to our
infrastructure

00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
okay

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
gotcha yeah all
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
right so was that in the original en
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
coil legislation oh yes okay I'm sure
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
they have a good reason for that all
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
right any other questions you another
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
one different
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
one all right if now getting to the CFR
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
791 China is of course on that list mhm
 
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
I think it's something like 20% of our
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
lumber of our it's certainly our
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
hardwood lumber in upstate goes to
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and distributors in China
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
does this
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
mean your interpretation since you've
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
been with this a lot longer than I have
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
does this mean that we can default on a
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
delivery and they cannot Sue to get
 
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.230 align:start position:0%
delivery and they cannot Sue to get
their

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
delivery by contract for instance
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
supposing supposing uh some third party
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
in China wants to back up we we don't
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
deliver they paid for it we didn't
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
deliver yeah now there's a lawsuit
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
between these two people and they hire a
 
00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:10.150 align:start position:0%
between these two people and they hire a
third

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
party to help fund that
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit does that mean that they cannot
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
do that that third party would have to
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
report and if they're on this list no
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to do that they
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do it right so these
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
These are outside
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
entities influencing lawsuits right they
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
have no interest in the lawsuit other
 
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
than monetary
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
gain that's what this bill is aiming for
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
Chinese receiver of the lumber still
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
could could sue to get their Lumber yeah
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
but they can't have a third party
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
financing it according to those well the
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
question would be is would they have
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
solvency issues or financial issues that
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
would need them to find a third party to
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
finance that's the question that's
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
that's the question and and so what
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
we're saying is if it's a foreign if
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
it's a foreign trans your no your B bets
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
off that the ability to do this
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
financing is is is really only American
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
citizens we only want we only want
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
Americans to be able to get this because
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
really it's more aimed at an actual
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
citizen not even for a small Corporation
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
corpor we assume corporations know what
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
they're doing and know how to how to
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
handle their litigation expenses would
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
you believe would you believe you
 
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.669 align:start position:0%
you believe would you believe you
believe

00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions oh yes representative Sal so
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm uh not as prepared as I should
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
be because I didn't get this I didn't
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
get to read this before I came in but is
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
this essentially saying that if I were
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
to be in a lawsuit I couldn't get
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
funding or financing to help pay for the
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
expense of that lawsuit by somebody who
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
isn't party to the lawsuit that is not
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
saying this at all okay this is a
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
reporting measure oh it's purely about
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
reporting that's right we're not saying
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
that the activity cannot occur okay we
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
just want to know who's doing it and to
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
what extent okay so if I found some
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
outside investor who thought oh I'm
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
going to get a share of your your
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
windfall if you win um I can do that and
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
then that that but that has has to be
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
disclosed that this company is okay
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
correct and isn't it true that some
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
states actually did try to C that
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
contract and how much you could get but
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
that is not in this Bill yes that was a
 
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
consideration sure it's a Live Free or
 
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
consideration sure it's a Live Free or
Die

[Laughter]

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
g good morning good morning Mr
 
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
chairperson members of the committee my
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
name is Brandon grat I'm a senior
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General and chief of
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection and anti trust
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the New Hampshire Department
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
of Justice here neither in support nor
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
against this bill nor with any opinion
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
on whether it's needed or the merits but
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
simply to point out that I believe the
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement Provisions that have been
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
built into this which anticipate
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general enforcement um perhaps
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
are not not as well thought out as they
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
should be and don't actually provide
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
meaningful opportunity for the Attorney
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
General's office to be able to prevent
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
to enforce and hold accountable those
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
who might violate this I
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
currently if I'm reading it
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
correctly there is an enforcement
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
provision for the Attorney General's
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
office that is built in um looks like on
 
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
office that is built in um looks like on
page

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%

00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
not more than the fines established in
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 358
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
C4 for each violation which shall acre
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
to the state and may be recovered in a
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
legal claim brought by the Attorney
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
General so that gives us the ability to
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
pursue a civil penalty um and to do
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
nothing else so ordinarily we would have
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
all the rights and remedies available
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
under the the consumer protection act uh
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
including the ability to go to court to
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
enjoying the conduct and protect people
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
from further harm this simply gives us
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
the ability to pursue a penalty and if
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is a $400
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
billion operation as was described by
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
the sponsor I I would suggest that a
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
$10,000 penalty is probably going to be
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
written into the cost of doing business
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
and won't pose much of a real threat to
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to completely ignore
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
this and challenge the Attorney
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
General's office to come get him with a
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
fine um happy to Force this bill if it
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
was put into law however I think that
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know anytime the Attorney General's
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
office is given an enforcement
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's important to give us
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
broad authority to take measures that
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
are appropriate to not only f a business
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
but to prevent the conduct from harming
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
anybody in the future if they're
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
ignoring state law and I think that the
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
way this is written we may not have that
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity so I wanted to be sure to
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
point that out and to posee for your
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
consideration that you know if the
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is going to be
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
enforcing this and holding companies
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
accountable to the requirements that are
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
biged into this bill um we should have
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
all the rights and remedies available
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
under 358a in order to enjoin that
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
conduct seek restitution investigate not
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
just merely the ability to bring a claim
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
for a civil penalty well not
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
withstanding that we're talking about uh
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
could potentially Assurance
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
product and insurance is technically
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
exempt for the consumer protection act
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't we have to then cover that
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
shortcoming also potentially um I I I
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
know that there are a number of folks
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
here from the insurance department who I
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
think could speak to whether this is or
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
is not an insurance product and in what
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
context it would or wouldn't be um I
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
admittedly know where that line is
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes but not all the time so all I
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
can speak to is there is built into this
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
a expectation that the Attorney
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
General's office will be able to to get
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
civil penalties there could be an
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
exemption issue in there as well but
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
even if there isn't I I don't think that
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is going to provide the AG's office
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
with the meaningful opportunity to do
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
anything about violations of the statute
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
so how about we just lift the penalty
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
not make any reference to 358a but just
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
lift the penalty of triple
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
damages which is a right of private
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
private right of action and just leave
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
it as a private right of action rather
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
than getting the AG's office involved at
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
all that is certainly up to this
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
committee if if that's the the TR that
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
you want to take um I would leave it to
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
my colleagues at the insurance
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
department to speak to whether they
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
would have any meaningful enforcement
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
over this um certainly if what you're
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
trying to regulate is a business that is
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
using a product that is ripe for
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection violations which it
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
seems that this would be I would imagine
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
you would want at least one state agency
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
with the ability to meaningfully enforce
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
it so I can't speak to whether the
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department would be able to do
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
that um as it's worded I don't think the
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office would be able
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
to do it right okay so we we just need
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
to move it out of the 358a and put it
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
into the consumer protection statutes in
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance department if the
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department wants it
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
well there's the question of want and
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
there's also the question of whether
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate always would be an
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
insurance product over which they would
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
have the authority um certainly if it is
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
then they would if it isn't then we
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
would if it's an unfair deceptive actor
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
practice which currently it isn't it
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
just gives us the ability to seek a
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
civil penalty so I think all of those
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
considerations are the points that I
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
wanted the committee to take away from
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
my testimony happy to answer any
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
questions if I can be helpful perfect
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
much okay call up uh DJ Benton Court
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
department good morning Mr chairman
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
DJ beton Court commissioner of the New
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department you guys
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
have put my law school education to the
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
test here this morning thinking through
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
issues I'll focus on the insurance
 
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.710 align:start position:0%
issues I'll focus on the insurance
pieces

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
first but I have nothing to say on
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
international law so I'll disclose that
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
outset uh what brings the department
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
here today and I've talked to you about
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
this on a number of occasions already
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
and I won't get into it but we've talked
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
about the current hard Market that the
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
industry is going through and I think as
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned before some of the
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
industries that are most in impacted by
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
the current hard Market are
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and just recently has come on
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
to my radar daycare centers and Child
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
Care Centers they are really struggling
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
those nonprofits and those daycare child
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
care centers are having a very very
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
difficult time finding liability
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
insurance and where they can find it it
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
is enormously expensive because as I've
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
said there's a basic Supply demand type
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
Dynamic that sets in that the narrower
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
the access to coverage the more
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
expensive the coverage that remains
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
becomes and as you look at the
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
components of that hard market and again
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
I've talked about this before but social
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
inflation is one of the drivers of that
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
hard market and so we look at this
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
legislation as having the potential to
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
play a significant role in softening the
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
hard Insurance Market in a handful of
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
ways the first is with enhanced risk
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
transparency and so by disclosing
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
litigation data insurers gain clearer
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
insights into the risks associated with
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
specific sectors or types of coverage
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
this transparency helps them better
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
evaluate and price policies which can
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to more competitive
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
premiums the second is improved Market
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
competition when litigation data is
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
readily available it allows insurers to
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
identify areas of opportunity or
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
underpricing in the market this can lead
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
to increased competition amongst
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
insurers to offer better rates and
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
coverage options which again can

common issues that lead to disputes by
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
proactively addressing those issues

which in turn can lead to more favorable

market conditions and lower premiums for
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
consumers so in in summary Mr chairman
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
the disclosure that is contemplated in
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation helps insurers meet the
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements as well as the
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
other items that I've listed there and
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
the transparent the transparency can
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
help maintain the overall health of the
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
insurance Market by ensuring the
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
companies are accurately representing
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
their risk exposure the disclosure of
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
third-party litigation can enhance
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
transparency support better risk
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
assessment and management Foster
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
competition and ultimately lead to a
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
more efficient and stable Insurance
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
Market before I conclude I would just
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
note that we deal often times with model
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
legislation the model legislation that
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
we most commonly deal with are typically
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
model laws or rules that come from the
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we don't see as many from
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
En coil which stands for the National
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
Council of insurance legislators but my
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
experience has been that while there is
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of stakeholder input there's a lot
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
of vetting that goes into these model
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
laws and most of the time they take
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
years to develop to work through all of
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
those issues and to ensure that all of
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders have had an opportunity
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
to share their feedback you have to have
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
a certain level of flexibility within
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
the models to account for the various
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
nuances that each state is going to have
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
to account for so the fact that there
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
are some language considerations that
 
00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:26.519 align:start position:0%
probably need to get worked out during
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is hardly
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
surprise uh with respect to the issues
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General's office
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
raised I'm a bit skeptical that we'll
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
have authority there uh this is a
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
financial type product and not one that
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
we would typically oversee so I'm not
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
sure that the entities identified in his
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
testimony are ones that we regulate but
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
we can certainly have a conversation
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
that pulls in not only the Attorney
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
General's office and my office but
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
probably banking as well to make sure
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
that we're getting that exactly correct
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
banking along with insurance has our own
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce the consumer
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
protection act that is outside of the
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
authority of the Attorney General's
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
office so that's why we'll need to bring
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
those three parties together to figure
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
out exactly as Mr Gard identified where
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
the lines of authority are so that we
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
can collectively make sure that we're
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
getting this legislation where it needs
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
to be so with that said Mr chairman I'm
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions um I guess I'm I forgot to ask
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
Brian did who's who's the reporting to
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
who who in the transparency of this
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
where they reporting it who are they
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
reporting what is it Secretary of
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
State's office yeah Secretary of State's
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
office okay um and then but at this
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
point um you don't see this as
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
technically you're being regulated by
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
you anyways it's not clear to me that we
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
would be the ones that so theoretically
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
because this is in would you believe
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
that this is this is really I guess
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be handled the
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
penalty but through a
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
litigation then the penalties really
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
should just be uh uh the triple damages
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
just the phrase the triple damages and
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
let the court uh handle the case
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
complaint the in cour and keep it out of
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
insurance and banking all together Mr
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
chairman if you believe it I believe it
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's certainly an
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
option well I'll see what I believe
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
after the hearing thank you very much
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
you bet you thank you Mr chairman now
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
let's see what I really believe Let's uh
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
let's have uh Marissa Chase and
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
Samantha heaving from the trial lawyers
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
who are in opposition to this
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
legislation just happened to not be in
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
the room and I said is there anybody in
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
opposition but I'm glad you're here so
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
we we do get the other point of view
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
which I love to have thank you Mr
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Marissa Chase I'm
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
the executive director for the New
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire trial lawers Association the
 
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs bar and uh with me is
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
Samantha hering from um the law firm of
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
shaheena Gordon she's a member of our
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
board I just want to start out with uh
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
this is a na as we've heard this is a
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
national model piece of legislation I
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
believe it's well intended this is very
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
biased and one-sided this only seeks for
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
disclosure on the plaintiff side there
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
are no similar uh Financial disclosures
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
meant on or in this legislation
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
placed on the defense side if this were
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
really about transparency I think we
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
would ask the insurance companies to
 
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
disclose how much they're setting aside
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
in reserves to settle any single uh oh
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard that issue before we have Mr
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
chairman we've been through this dance
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
before and I will this is the opposite
 
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
side of the dance right no no I think
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing okay um but and
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
before um uh attorney hearing gets into
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
her testimony I will just note that you
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire's is a small state
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
with a collegial bar this is our members
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
do not recommend generally for
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs to seek litigation funding um
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
we are not um you know we we don't
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
believe that they often we believe they
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
often do not serve the best interest of
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
claimants this again this is a small
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
state we're not a state that sees
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
massive torts or massive class class
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
action lawsuits this type of let um
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
advanced funding litigation typically
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
happens elsewhere in the country
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
thankfully not in New Hampshire we don't
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
have to um burden ourselves with that so
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
we believe this bill is unnecessary and
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
already uh any concerns that this seeks
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
to address are already covered by court
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
rules not by implementing a new statute
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
that um I was looking at RSA
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
294 um and this is kind to govern
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure in court proced procedure
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
this seems like a weird place to put it
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
so with that I will turn it over to
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
Samantha if that's
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and I would Echo what
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
Marissa said about our general policy I
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say policy our general rule of
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
thumb as attorneys who practice with the
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
tri trial lawyers group is that we
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage our clients not to
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
seek these contracts um you know I tell
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
people something to the effect of it is
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
your money and you know it's not my
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
place to tell you what to do with it but
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
I want you to be aware of these really
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
high interest rates and how over time
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
the amounts can build um that's
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
certainly something that a lawyer should
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
be counseling their clients about but I
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see that the disclosure
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
requirements of this bill in in terms of
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
disclosure to litigation parties not the
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
terms of what should be disclosed in a
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
contract to the consumer but the
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
disclosure Provisions in this bill
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
regarding disclosure to parties of
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
litigation don't do anything that I can
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
see to advance the claimant's interest
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
or protect the client in any way um New
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already has a sufficient
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
system system of mechanisms in our court
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
rules to make sure that parties are
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
giving the other side all relevant
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
information and Discovery you know we
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
start with rule 22 automatic disclosures
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
in every case where uh within 30 to 60
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
days of pleadings being filed at the
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
beginning of the case parties have to
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
give certain information to each side
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
list of people with relevant information
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
a copy of all documents that are
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
relevant a couple other things now of
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
course you don't have to trust that your
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
opposing attorney is going to give you
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
everything that's relevant you can still
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
seek Discovery under rule 21 from the
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
court and that rule sets out various
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
methods in part A I
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
believe um if I were to seek Discovery
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
from my opponent and they were to
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
improperly fail to respond or respond
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
with an objection that just truly has no
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
merit I can go to the court I can seek a
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
a motion for conditional default I can
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
also seek a a motion to compel to force
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
them to give me that information and in
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
that process what the judge does as many
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
of you probably know I'm sure is they
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
they appli the our our test to determine
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
whether evidence is
 
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.270 align:start position:0%
whether evidence is
relevant

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
um under rule 401 evidence is relevant
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
only if it has a tendency to make any
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
fact of consequence in the action more
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
or less probable than without the
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
information fact of consequence is an
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
element of the claim or the defenses or
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
even damages um but it's certainly not
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
the existence of a funding
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
contract the other point that I would
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
make is regarding the privileged
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
Communications provision which is under
 
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.750 align:start position:0%
Communications provision which is under
294

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
294
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
F10 excuse me 294
 
00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:35.309 align:start position:0%
F10 excuse me 294
F9

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
F9
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
um that makes the communications between
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
the consumer's attorney and the funding
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
comp company privileged only with
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
respect to the person against whom the
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
legal claim is asserted but it is not it
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
does not mirror the language of the
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
disclosure provision which says that
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
consumers have to provide that to
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
parties that they filed a claim against
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
parties to litigate or any insured with
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
an obligation to Ure the claim that's
 
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.510 align:start position:0%
an obligation to Ure the claim that's
being

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
litigated um so I think those
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
Communications should be privileged from
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
start to finish but I I just want to
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
Echo that in a system where we often
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
defer to judges and courts to determine
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
issues of relevance admissibility who
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
should get what documents in a case what
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
does the case actually need I think that
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
we should continue doing that sometimes
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
we lawyers like to fight for no reason
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
and the judges can resolve that very
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
quickly um
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
also I think transpar if transparency is
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
the goal I think we can establish that
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
very well for everybody involved by
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
having a judge do for example in camera
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
review of any relevant documents before
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
deciding whether that's disclosed to the
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
other party happy to take
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
questions okay any questions from the
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
committee members yes
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative if thank you for letting
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
me ask a question thank you for your
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
testimony do you happen to know
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
currently if there are any third party
 
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.109 align:start position:0%
currently if there are any third party
litigation

00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
financing um agreements currently in New
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with any cases yes I do I know
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
that it's come up in the context of the
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
YDC cases which I'm sure everybody here
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
um some attorneys who took over uh later
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
in the process once those cases had
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
already become they' already started
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
they were already maybe halfway through
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
or so attorneys took over later what we
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
realized was funding contracts were
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
already well established for those cas
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
bis and the train had pretty much left
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
the station so in that
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance we do have to sign the
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
contracts on occasion but that's the
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
only context I'm aware of that it's
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
much okay uh so
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair n gra for the
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce we support
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation um I will be as brief
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
as possible um I think the five reasons
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh listed by commissioner bonc Court are
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh some of the main reasons that we
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
support this legislation so I'm not
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
going to repeat those um I I do want to
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
address uh one particular ular thing
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
here um this uh this issue was brought
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
to our attention by the US chamber as an
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
emerging issue um New Hampshire despite
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
being a small state has become you know
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
increasingly attractive as a place to uh
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
to see uh this type of funding um simply
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
because the industry as uh the sponsor
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned in his opening statement is
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
growing um so they're looking for new
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
markets we also have cases like YDC that
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
are attracting this type of invest
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and other states are enacting
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
transparency laws as well which is uh
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging the uh the market to adjust
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
and to move into States like ours that
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
don't yet have this type of transparency
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
legislation um because we don't have it
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
in place we really can't accurately
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
judge uh how how much of this is
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
occurring in the state um and we think
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
that this is really important for the
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
process uh that I outlined in my letter
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
which is really so that the parties
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
litigation and the court system
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
understand what's happening um they
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
understand the different dynamics that
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
are occurring and they can make uh
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
reason judgments uh within the context
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
of the case certainly happy to take any
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions anyone may have um and I'm
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
happy to work uh further with anyone uh
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
this okay guess we don't have any
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%

insurance companies we are in support of
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
this bill I will be as brief as I can
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and those for me did
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
fantastic jobs um um presenting the
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
bill this practice of an uninterested
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
party coming into a lawsuit to provide
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
for solely financial reasons dates back
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years and it was illegal
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
under English common law for hundreds of
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
years under the practice called champery
 
00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.589 align:start position:0%
years under the practice called champery
and

00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance it was not until the
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
1990s uh it's my understanding and I'm
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
not an attorney let me begin with that
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
um it's my understand in the 1990s in
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
Australia uh where the modern practice
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
of third party litigation financing
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
began and it has swollen to as the prime
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor testified a $400 billion Global
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
industry um this as others have said is
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
a very uh unclear unregulated shadowy
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
industry um the impetus for this bill
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 733 came about uh over this
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh last summer in Fall there was a study
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
committee Senate Bill
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
236 um which I would the staff member of
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
that study committee before I entered
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
this role when I worked for the Senate
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that that
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
committee it was a study committee about
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
the uh hard Insurance market for
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and one of the things that
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
came up in that committee was um uh
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear verdicts the incredibly high
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
costs that insurance has to pay and
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofits being pulled into lawsuits
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
that they have no there was no reason
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
for legitimate reason for them to be
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
brought in other than seeking another
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
pot of money to get um so that's where
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
this bill came from um I'm just checking
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
my notes here to make sure I didn't miss
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
anything I think that is everything I
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
want to add I'd be happy to take any
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
any R Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:43:57.069 --> 00:43:57.079 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um you you just
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
describe the sh the shadowy
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
industry and I'm just wondering how does
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
that work how do they uh how do they
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
determine which cases they they're going
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
to uh pursue to sort of reinforce so
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
that they can share in the rewards how
 
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
how does that uh work in your
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
understanding sure so my understanding
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question my
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they look these
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
well first off we don't know how often
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
or uh how many of these cases there are
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
because there is no disclosure
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
transparency unless you're in one of the
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
states that has
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
enacted uh or the Court District that
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
have enacted disclosure rules um Min are
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
saying is that they're just looking for
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
the biggest pot of money that they can
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
get um and and support those cases to
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
money brother set there we all set all
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
POS of the bill as is okay there we go
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
you would like to see I qualified yes
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
qualified who is
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
Arc good morning Mr chairman my name is

Eric Schuler I'm the president for the
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
alliance for responsible Consumer Legal
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
funding it's easier just put Arc that's
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
kind of what we go by so say it again
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
the alliance for responsible Consumer
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
Legal funding where the trade
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
Association largest trade associ a that
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
represents the companies that offer the
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
Consumer Legal funding product uh first
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
of all I want to thank representative
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
Cole when this bill first came out um he
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
was very receptive to meeting with me
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
and with the other interested parties
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
and trying to work out a bill that I
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
think with the amendment we're uh pretty
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
much in agreement too um it's kind of
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
nice to see everybody on the same side
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to everybody yelling at each
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
other across the table uh so I want to
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank him for uh allowing me to come in
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
and make some some suggestions to the
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
bill and which in the amendment is the
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions that we put forward uh to it
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
one things I think I just wanted to kind
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
of maybe take a half step backwards and
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
clarify there's two products that fall
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
under this the term of
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
tlf one of which is Consumer Legal
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
funding the other was litigation
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
financing and they're two different
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
animals but they get lumped in under one
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
umbrella so what litigation financing is
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
is it it is just that it finances the
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
litigation the money is used
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
specifically for attorney's fees Med uh
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees deposition costs uh
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
making sure the court filing fees are
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
covered all things like that Consumer
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
Legal funding is where a company gives a
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
consumer who has a pending legal claim
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
in most cases their car accidents so
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
money for immediate household needs
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
mortgage car payment things like that
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we're clear the funds we provide the
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
consumer cannot be used to fund the
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
litigation to give you some differences
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
our average funding on the consumer side
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
is about $3 to
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
$5,000 the minimums on the litigation
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
financing side start at $3
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
million it's just a couple of zeros
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
difference I gave testimony in another
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
state and one of the legislators told me
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
well it's a government rounding error
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
story and what I really like what
 
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
representative Cole did was we clear
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
Define the two products in the the new
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
draft of the
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
legislation we recorded differently the
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
consumer side of things and I call the
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
commercial side of things so you're
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
regulating properly the Consumer Legal
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
funding the consumers who get money to
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
make sure they can keep a roof over
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
their head and food in the table and
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
also addressing directly the differences
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
on the litigation financing side of
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
those entities that give money to fund
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
the actual litigation
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
itself um
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
we when the the phrase came up you know
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
this is a $400 billion do a year
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
industry I want to clarify that's on the
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
litigation financing side that's not on
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Legal funding side trust me
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
if we're $400 billion do a year industry
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
race we do do some work in New Hampshire
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
I I've did some some checking and I
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
think we probably do about 150 to 200
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
transactions a year so on the Consumer
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
Legal funding side it's not a huge
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
Market but I'd like to have 50 statutes
 
00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.349 align:start position:0%
Market but I'd like to have 50 statutes
50

00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
states I want to make sure that the
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
consumers who are getting the Consumer
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
Legal funding product are getting it
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
from responsible companies getting it
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
from companies that um are doing it the
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
right way it also actually helps my
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
companies because if you're doing work
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
especially in a financial services and
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
in an area that's unregulated you could
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
have one court order you could have one
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
decision come down and it could wipe out
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
your entire portfolio by having guard
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
rails on it you're ensuring that what
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
you're doing is doing it properly the
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
consumer is protected and the legal
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
system itself is also protected so with
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
that I'll happy to answer any
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions um are you regulated by
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
anybody in certain States we are yes
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
under Insurance well it depends upon the
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
state so in some states it's it's a
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
registration with secretary state's
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
office which I think is kind of looking
 
00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:30.799 align:start position:0%
at here some states it's uh Department
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
of Consumer Credit other states a
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
department of banking it's a little it's
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
whatever that particular state has um in
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
Ohio as an example it's basically uh
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
Thou shalt and thou shalt not type of a
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
thing there isn't a registration or a
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
regulator there um if you're interested
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
you can go to our website which is on
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
the the portfolio on the right hand side
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
you can see all the statutes that have
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
passed across the country
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay so making sure this is what we call
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
a classic language issue yes it's key
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
word the words are it means everything
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
so um you're really financing you're
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
really a a a loan bank you're loaning
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
people money up front and and expect to
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
get paid back once the case settles well
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
we don't consider a loan because with a
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
loan there's a guaranteed some certain
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
of payment meaning that if I give you a
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
dollar today no matter what happens I'm
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
getting my dollar back and if I don't
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
get my dollar back I can do something
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
negative to you the only way we get paid
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
back on the contract is if the consumer
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
is successful in their claim and then
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
secondarily if there's enough funds left
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
over so after attorney's fees medical
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
leans statutory leans then we get paid
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
if there's not enough money to make that
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
obligation we don't get paid and also in
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
the rare occasion and it does happen
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
where the consumer drops the claim so
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
let's say they go to their attorney and
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
say hey where are we with this and the
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
attorney says well we've got a good case
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at another 12 18
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
months on this and it's like I'm tired
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
this snow I'm moving to Florida and
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
drops the case there's nothing we can do
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
we're just out that money the only way
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
we can go after a consumer is if there's
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
fraud involved and because we have the
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
attorney sign off the transaction the
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
attorney would have to be involved with
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
it and I really don't know many
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are willing to lose their
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
law license over $3,000 someone else
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
got so it's like mortgage insurance that
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
you're covering it's it's I mean if you
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
had to to Kin it to something is more of
 
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
a of a speculation for lack of a better
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
term it's we're saying yeah okay there's
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
a good probability you're going to be
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
successful in your case and if you're
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
successful we get paid but if you're
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful we don't and about 10% of
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
the time our compan get absolutely zero
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
back and about 30 to 35% of the time we
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
get less than contracted amount back so
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
it is a very high-risk
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
Kips thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify this morning um
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
this bill uh deals with litigation
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
funding um and You' specified that
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
litigation funding and Consumer Legal
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
funding are totally different um does
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
this bill that's before us today deal
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
with Consumer Legal funding in any way
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and it does in the general form and
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
also specifically also in the the new
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment it it clearly defines better
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
we think the differences between the two
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
but it does regulate both the consumer
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
side and the commercial litigation
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
financing side it does regulate both
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
entities so you're in this language here
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
is what is what you want right that and
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
the and the the major Amendment yes
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by Major
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
is okay but this is the amendment that
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about yes but in terms of
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
the regular bill but that adding this
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph right yeah I'm referring to
 
00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
paragraph right yeah I'm referring to
202-

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
202-
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
03218 okay it was where we're in support
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
of oh I have 294 F5 and then F7 am I
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
missing another page something
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
here okay yeah all right representative
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony um just to help me better
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
understand your industry you have a
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
contract it goes to a potential client
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
or partner their attorney reads the
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
contract correct what's your
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
relationship with their attorney it's
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
basic are they part part of the contract
 
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
do they sign off and they just basically
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it because we want to make
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
sure that the attorney is fully involved
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
and fully knowledgeable of it because
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually the attorney who repays
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
the company out of the consumer's trust
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
account so when an basically an
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
insurance claim comes in and gets paid
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
it goes to the consumer's attorney goes
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
to their trust account and then the
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
attorney is the one who cuts the checks
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
they cut a check to themselves to any
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
other medical leans or whatever it is
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
and then they cut a check to us so we
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure they're fully aware of
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
these transactions right from the GetGo
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
just quick followup for the question
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
meire so the the attorney doesn't have
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
any contractual relationship with you no
 
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
but they benefit by approving the
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
contract right so if they say yes you
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
know I advise you to sign this they're
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
getting a cut of the proceed the
 
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.990 align:start position:0%
getting a cut of the proceed the
potential

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
windfall well no they get their money
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
out of the the settlement not from us
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
and we're clear in the statute there can
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
be no quid proquo between the funny
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
companies and the attorneys so there's
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
nothing in going between us they only
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
get paid out of the settlement as well
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%

this bill to report yes your transaction
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
morning chairman members of the
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh Nathan fennessy I'm an
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
attorney at predy flarity here in
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
conquer I represent AIG when I don't
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
have uh when I'm not up here spending
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
time with you I I defend and and
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
litigate cases um so I want to speak to
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
really just the disclosure piece of this
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
which is why AIG supports this bill uh
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
for years in New Hampshire uh defendants
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
in in litigation have had to disclose
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
information about their potential
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
insurance policies that could apply
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
including policy limits uh what we're
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
looking for here is uh what I would say
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
reciprocal transparency which is if uh
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
if either a consumer or a business is
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
getting some funding for their
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
litigation that they simply disclose
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
that information so that everybody
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
understands who has a potential interest
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the litigation who has control over
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
the litigation um we think that's a
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's a fair thing to do for both sides
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
um with respect to you know there's a
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
lot in the bill I I won't speak to all
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
the various Provisions in the bill but
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
we do think there's some common sense uh
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh regulations within it such as making
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
sure that a contract's filled out before
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
the consumer actually signs it that that
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
to us just seems like common sense so
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
everybody understands what they're
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
getting into so um that's all I have
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
everybody else has uh I think covered
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
most of what you need thank you jog my
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
memory because I know this was last year
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
but the issue didn't come to Commerce so
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
we we did pass the statute where but no
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
I I didn't think it passed it failed so
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
you imply that it did pass that you have
 
00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
the uh disclose the so under court rules
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
you have to so in L so I I do want to
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
address one point so under court rules
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
there is an obligation under the
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory disclosure obligations for
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to disclose
 
00:57:25.319 --> 00:57:26.789 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to disclose
information

00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh that is in the court rules it's rule
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
22 so that's if the judge deems it
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate nope no so what was the
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of the Court the bill we passed
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
last year last year's bill was trying to
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
force insurance companies before there
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
was any litigation to give information
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
over to plaintiff's attorneys that was
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of that
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill right that didn't that one fail it
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
did not it did not pass so I I did just
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
want to address that one issue because
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
what I think I heard from um from the
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
Trial Bar was well if you want this
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
information you can just ask for it well
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in other states when
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
people have asked for it they've opposed
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
that and taking the position that this
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
is confidential it's not relevant you're
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
not entitled to any of this information
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impact any claim or defense
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
and so that's why these other states
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
have have moved forward with some sort
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
of a disclosure uh statute because doing
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
it in the context of litigation leaves
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
it up to an individual basis for a judge
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not this
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
information can be
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
shared got it all
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you uh
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
Chris you want to say anything I think
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh Chris nickolopoulos uh representing
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
the National Association of mutual
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies I've provided you
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
written testimony we support this bill
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work on uh any of the
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
Amendments I think re Spear's might be
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
right that that reference to Governor
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
may may actually supposed to be
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
president and president and and and
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh president Department of State these
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
are these are U people that have been uh
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
characterized as foreign actors so I
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
don't think I think it's right that
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
might be a typo but we're happy to work
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
on that uh I think this is as the
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
President of the United States is
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to weigh in no these are these
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
are folks that have already been um
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
adjudicated as foreign actors um ah
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
already been identified
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
as the it's a federal it's referencing a
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation for uh foreign actors
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
that have already been uh listed
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
gotcha um but otherwise this is a great
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
bill I think ensuring that consumers
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
understand what they're filling out
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
before they enter the these Arrangements
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
um is important and the disclosure is
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
going to make uh the whole litigation
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
process better I don't need to say more
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
than that great thank
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
you Jim do you want
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
to represent Jim Hayden from State
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
Farm and we'll wrap it up for us I will
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
wrap it up in as quickly as humanly
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
possible um so members of the committee
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to take 10 minutes uh I
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
will take no more than five and a half
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
so members of the committee Jim hadum uh
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of State Farm one of our
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
state's largest writer of homeowners and
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
auto insurance and I I'm here to testify
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
in support of HB
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
733 um and I understand there's an
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
amendment floating around and I'm happy
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee on that
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that um you know State
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
Farms support of this bill I is really
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
focuses on the fact that uh this
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
litigation financing is a big business
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's here to stay uh and it certainly
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
helps uh folks in New Hampshire um with
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
their litigation and their litigation
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
expenses um that hopefully ultimately
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
will promote Justice um the concern we
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
have is it comes at a high cost and we
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
think it's in everybody's interest to
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
make sure those high costs are front and
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
center for anybody who's considering
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
taking out litigation financing um the
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
high cost comes in the form of legal
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
fees uh excuse me Interest fees and
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
other charges that go into the lending
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
um and this bill would make sure that
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
those legal fees excuse me financing
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
fees uh and interest are front and
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
center so that when an attorney is
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
looking talking to their client about
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
taking out one of the some litigation
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
financing it's obvious to everybody what
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
the cost is going to be um and when it's
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
referenced that this business operates
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the shadows part of the Shadows of
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that we in New Hampshire don't
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
have a lot of experience with this uh
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
and we and attorneys aren't really well
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
equipped to uh inform their clients
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
about how much they might be able to get
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
from or how much an alternative premium
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
finan uh litigation financer might cost
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
so you know by Disclosure and getting
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
that information front and center it's
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to make it a whole lot easier for
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
the uh attorney who's advising their
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
client about litigation financing uh how
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
much it's going to cost them in the long
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
term um but it's also important that the
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
uh consumers and the PLS here understand
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
the cost of involving A thirdparty
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
lender in litigation um basically you're
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
introducing someone who has no interest
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
in Justice and is frankly looking to
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
make sure they get a return on their
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
investment right so they certainly want
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
to know what your case looks like they
 
01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:39.799 align:start position:0%
want to know all of the details and they
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
want to basically put themselves in the
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
middle of a litigation decision and
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
discussion between an attorney and
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
client um and that is understandable but
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
a necessary part of their willingness to
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
lend against the potential settlement of
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
return um and that plays out in the
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
Inception of the case where it's
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
question of confidential information um
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
and and strategies but it's also uh
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
involved in potential settlements
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
because uh the lender is going to have
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
an opinion about how fast and how much a
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
settlement might be um and so you know
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
they're really bringing someone into a a
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
business relationship that is is really
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
um I think it's clear that um when you
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
take away the financial impact of
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
litigation and and sort of pass that
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
risk off to a third party uh it is
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to have an impact on
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
the willingness of plaintiffs and
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
lawyers to bring cases and there's a lot
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
of thought out there that say say this
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
will promote frivolous litigation and
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
prolonged lawsuits um and I think that's
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
hard for folks to
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
ignore um and you know I think when it
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
the discussion about uh secrecy and um
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me um about operating in the
 
01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
shadows you know again Curr we don't
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of litigation financing going
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
on in New Hampshire but it is going on
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
we don't know really who's doing it we
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
really don't know the terms they're
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
offering and but certainly by uh having
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
them register you're really asking them
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
to register to do business the way we
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
ask every other business to to you
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
basically put their name down and their
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
contact information with the secetary
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
state's office so that if someone has an
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
issue with this company um they know who
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
to talk to
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
um so with that um I would wouldn't
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
touch on one point that was made
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
about enforcement and um there's a
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
pretty powerful enforcement mechanism
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
built into the the bill and that is if
 
01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
you violate the statute uh the contract
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
is null and void which basically means
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
the lender is not going to get their
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
money back so you have a really powerful
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
incentive for the responsible companies
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
that are willing to come to New
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and abide by our rules to you
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
know in effect you know abide by those
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
laws because the consequences of of not
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
abiding by our laws are simply they're
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
not going to ever get their money back
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
so um with that I would say I'm happy to
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
take any questions and I'm happy to work
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee on any Amendment
 
01:05:41.319 --> 01:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee on any Amendment
repres

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
Amon thank you for allowing me to take
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
ask a question um I'm trying to
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
understand you know you represent State
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
Farm you you're probably involved in a
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
lot of litigation over auto accidents
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing or maybe even let's focus
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
on auto accidents what's your
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with these companies do
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
they do they uh bolster the client's
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
ability to um to litigate against your
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
claim sometimes or do they do you
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
partner with them in other times so that
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know you share the risk with that
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
company for you know whatever the
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
damages might be what's State Farms
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
relationship um typical relationship
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
with these types of companies
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
so State Farm does not itself have any
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
direct relationship with any of these
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
companies um and it very frequently sees
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
them on the other side of you know
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
involved in lawsuits that they're
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
involved in um when you think of where
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
this might come into play you know
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's um and I forget the terminology
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
there's lending in advance to a
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
plaintiff who you know is basically
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
looking to get their money faster if
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
when they have a lawsuit okay
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but there's also uh uh lenders who
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
will in effect Finance the the
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
litigation cost for uh for a whole sort
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
of broad range of lawsuits like auto
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
accidents in order to in effect Finance
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
the acts of the you know the the legal
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
representation of plaintiff's lawyers so
 
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
that's where it comes into play you know
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
more with relation to State Farm and and
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
lastly um we see a lot of this involved
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
in class action lawsuits um and and
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of examples out there
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
when for those big
 
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
cases okay so um are you suggesting then
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
when it came to the violation section uh
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
we don't need paragraph little B at all
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
just get rid of that and just stick with
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
the you you they lose their lose their
 
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
right to get any money out of the case
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have an opinion on that
 
01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
right now but as I saw the committee
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
wrestling with the idea of enforcement I
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
think it's important to note that's
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
that's in there could be waved okay you
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're emphasizing a is already
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
there right but you're not necessarily
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
saying let's take B out but that that if
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
we did take B out that would certainly
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
clean up the problem yeah and I also saw
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and as well as so
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
here's this is a would what you believe
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting here
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
if the um
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to settle a
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
case and the attorneys who you know were
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
who are defending are saying boy we want
 
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
to make an offer to the other side and
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
get them to take this offer and settle
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
the case so we don't have to go to court
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
or having the information about what the
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
liabilities that defendant has and all
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing contracts that they
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
have out there wouldn't that be helpful
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
in the sense that then you know you need
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
to make make an offer good enough so
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
that they still get something out of it
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
after they've taken care of all those
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
PLS would you believe that that might
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
actually be a useful way to settle a
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
case if both parties know if you the
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
other party knows what what they're in
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
for yeah Mr chairman um I would say I
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
not only believe it I've also been
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
through the discussions with the trial
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
lawyers about when they should have
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
access to certain information uh
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
relating to policy holders and I
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
understand the dynamic I understand the
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
tension and I'm certainly willing to
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
sort of uh discuss how to sort of just
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
balance that if if this committee wants
 
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
to go in that direction oh
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
balance oh I like
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
please well on that happy
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.239 --> 01:11:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.239 --> 01:12:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.159 --> 01:12:54.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh everyone take their seats
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
and the peanut gallery
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
seats okay so um this morning it's a
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
little lighter because we will not have
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
a 678 which is the uh over the counter
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
because that bill has officially been
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
withdrawn um and so we will not be
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking that up so we're really now down
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
to um 10 uh 949 499 making technical
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
corrections to certain insurance laws
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
and we've just had an amendment passed
 
01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.669 align:start position:0%
and we've just had an amendment passed
out

01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
everyone hopefully you have in front of
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
you it has my name and it's amendment
 
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.669 align:start position:0%
you it has my name and it's amendment
number

01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
0364 and can I have someone from you oh
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
DJ you're here you want to just explain
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.310 --> 01:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman joining me at the
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
table is Jennifer Smith our legislative
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
director so this amendment is seeking to
 
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
clean up a couple of housekeeping items
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
that came up following our signing off
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
on what I've nicknamed to be our
 
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
technical Bill my understanding is there
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
is Broad consensus around these changes
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there is any controversy
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly answer any
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
questions you have so in terms of what
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
was in the original Bill what's in this
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
amendment what why you know just give us
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
the highlights of the Chang so I think
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
the first part of it Mr chairman was
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
something that you had raised in terms
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
of in I'm sorry carriers the carriers
 
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
had raised it pardon me so I think the
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
statute originally said 800,000 so just
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
minute right so we clarified that this
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
is only applying to new companies coming
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
in again the problem we were trying to
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
solve was the sometimes flood of
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
interest to form and domesticate a new
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company in new nights thought
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
it was number the low number was was too
 
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
appealing to ex choose New Hampshire to
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
create this scandalous entity and so our
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
team was just having to kick those
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
things back left and right so we wanted
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
to raise the threshold to get people who
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
are a little bit more serious about
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
actually doing good insurance work in
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so that is
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
where the uh language that you see here
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
comes from the number that we originally
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
set as I said to you I wanted to make
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we had a number that was not
 
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
serving as a deterrent to new players
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
that wanted to enter the market so we
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
picked a number that our team thought
 
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
met that criteria so this is this
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
company is going to be a domestic that's
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
right right so we don't want it to be
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
too high because we don't want people to
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
be scared in the hand we want to be
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
attractive so with three 3 million is
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
that are we still competitive I mean
 
01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely any date out there there's
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
any lower than us are we like no that's
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
in line with Mo most other states Mr
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
chairman okay good all right so that
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
one's that one that's Jen you want to
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
hit the next one sure um so the next um
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
from line for lines 23 um that section
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
so 23 through 27 those two changes are
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the um producers fee ction
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's in the technical Bill those were
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
just some cleanup items that didn't
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
carry over when we were um making that
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
first amendment so that's just a couple
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
cleanup things um on those two pieces
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
there okay so we're adding this
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
$25 is it if it's amending that we're
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
now adding e we're adding the $25 yeah
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
and it has always been a $25 fee I just
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
didn't carry over into the billly oh so
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
it got deleted or the fee got deleted it
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't carried over PR
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right good we are still
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
preserving the elimination of another a
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
number of all the other ones right right
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
I know there was a cast you know a lot
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
of them and I would note Mr chairman
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
that I found myself in a very awkward
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
place of being a bit ahead of my time in
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
the sense that we identified those fees
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
as being inefficient and not a good use
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
of Staff time and an annoyance the
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
industry I'm sure the governor will be
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
very pleased with you I was just going
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
to say the governor the governor put
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
that foresight y the put C forward and
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
this was uh Roman Roman numeral one on
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
my memo about what we're going to do to
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
help with that cause perfect go ahead
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh and then the next Amendment on
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
page um the next change excuse me on
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
page one line 31 um in the original um
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
text of the bill that we put forward um
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
it was addressing our Network ATAC
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement in the original uh
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill we had
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
struck that requirement completely but
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted um to amend it so that um it
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
was known that this information was
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
still available and could be publicly
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
available to everybody um so we just
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
amended it so instead of getting it
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
getting rid of it outright just making
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
it more of a notification it's available
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
folks want it perfect Mr chairman if I
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
might well I have you all this is going
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
to be something that you'll see a lot
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
more of I suspect next year again as
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
part of the Cod process we've gone
 
01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
through and analyzed all of the areas
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
within the insurance statute where we
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
have some some sort of reporting
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
requirement we're trying to determine
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're still necessary
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
and by necessary I mean are they just
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
checking a box that they're in
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
compliance rather than if we learn that
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
a company is not in compliance via our
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
consumer division or our enforcement
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
Division I can then request them to
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
produce the document that tells me where
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
they're at rather than having all sorts
 
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
of reporting requirements that are a
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
burden to Industry and often times do
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
not get the appropriate level followup
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
from the Department because we're just
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
buried in them so we're going to be
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
going through all of those over the
 
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
course of this year and coming back to
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
you probably with a number of these
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
again to try to not only be efficient
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
for industry and not a cost burden to
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
industry but also ensuring that we are
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
making the best use of our staff's time
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
right so it's a reasonable way to make
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
sure we have networ Network adequacy
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
without making a lot of in that
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
particular case that's exactly right
 
01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:23.719 align:start position:0%
okay and we are in the process of our
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
updating our Network adequacy rules
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
right now at the department so that's
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
where this came up from where those are
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
ready to be filed with jail car well I
 
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
know the mental health was yeah mission
 
01:20:38.669 --> 01:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
number one yes so um so more might come
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
that way from the network ad see as that
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
rule Works forward great um so the next
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
section come um so on page two line five
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
um this is relative to the law that
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
passed last year um SP 173 the no
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
surprises law um so these these are just
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
changes to um small changes to the law
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
we again over the summer after the bill
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
was signed and put into law we started
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
our rul making process on that bill um
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
and as we were writing our rules and
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
drafting those um it became clear that
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
we needed these small tweaks to the
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
statute to really um represent what the
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
were're trying to do in the bill
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
itself do you have to go back to Ru
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
making or did you actually already we're
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
in the process of it right now rules are
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
written and being filed which right we
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
just like tick of the egg which comes
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
first exactly so put simply Mr chairman
 
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
as you know the intent of the bill last
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
year as it pertained to balance billing
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
and those surprises Act was to mirror
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
the federal law we missed a couple of
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions there to make it mirror
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
exactly as we intended so we we fixed
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
great so when we moveed forward again I
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
think it was last year with the enhanced
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
protections around consumer guarantee
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
contracts we scooped in um manufacturer
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
service contracts on the manufacturer
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
products that had not been included in
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
that before it was included in one
 
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
section but not the other we've
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
determined that they should not be under
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
that so we're just cleaning up that
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
provision that makes it clear they're
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
going back to how the regulatory
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
environment was for them prior to the
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
big uh enhancement Bill last year so
 
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
again that's a technical correction well
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
so who is responsible for those service
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
contracts Keith Keith yes who's
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for the manufacturing
 
01:22:31.199 --> 01:22:32.470 align:start position:0%
responsible for the manufacturing
warranty

01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
warranty
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
stuff they're still subject to the
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
unfair Trade Practices statute I could
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
tell you that so there's not
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
complete you know free reign there we
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
still have some oversight there right
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
because but that's we get a lot of
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
complaints right to people who buy these
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
extended warranties and say so th this
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
applies to what we're talking about our
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer service contracts we do not
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
get a lot of complains about
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
manfacturers contract service contracts
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
to who's buying these manufactured who's
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
who's I'm sorry Mr chairman so let's
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
take John Deere we had complaints about
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
John Deere so John Deere has a service
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
contract with a third
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
party or this is their there's this is
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
their their service contract on their
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
products and who's taking advantage of
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
this so under that scenario that would
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
fall under the Attorney General's office
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
that would be under consumer protection
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
anyways them okay so what yeah so give
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
me that's right give me one that I know
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
that we're is is that we're basically
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
taking things that normally would have
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
been a under the consumer protection act
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
and taking it out of your statute that's
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
right well this is a bit of a cleanup to
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if you'll notice the
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
numbering is quite off when we issued
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
our bulletin over the summer um it came
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
to our attention so it went one two
 
01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
three four nine so everything else had
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
been cleaned up and then that kind of
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
did not get cleaned up and when the bill
 
01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
was in enrolling so it should be in the
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
next public utilities on no Public
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
Utilities okay and we did run this by
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
industry is the one that brought this to
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
us as well as when the bulletin went out
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so we addressed it with industry and
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
cleaned it up as they requested that's
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
right attorney Hayden back there is very
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
involved with those particular kinds of
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
products if you've got questions about
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
how they work or how historically those
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
products have been overseen I think
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
Jim's your guy you can you can get him
 
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
an extra hour he can Bill his client but
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
he had cell phones you know their
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
insurance products on cell phones I mean
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't believe you wouldn't
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
believe the number of times he turns up
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
on something you're like you're involved
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
with this too okay all
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
right I think that's it that's about it
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's just ruming okay all right any
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
questions to the committee members
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
too many hearings today Mr chairman
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%

to take
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
action now we need
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%

pre-

01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
pre-
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
numbering but I guess it's good good to
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
make sure we don't forget somebody in
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
the way proc assess okay so it's not
 
01:25:59.790 --> 01:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
executive though this is no this is the
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
were just think by the time we get to
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%

01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
it this one let's use this one okay got
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
with oh okay so let's just use
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
that what's that cleaning
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
up9 and we're putting the amendment okay

right the motion is not to pass as
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
amended is there any discussion on the
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%

please say I I 3 four five
 
01:29:33.679 --> 01:29:35.470 align:start position:0%
please say I I 3 four five
67

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
67
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay and then adopted all right and
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
executing all right next up is 552
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
relative to coverage of children under
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
552 I believe we had no problems with
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
this bill right no cost to the state
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
right yeah actually I I have a question
 
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
on that okay sure the subcommittee so I
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
can ask question internally right in in
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
sub committees this is very relaxed
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
where it's a it's a conversation yeah so
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
the question is that uh you know it's
 
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
good that you don't require them to be a
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
student under 25 but right but I also
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
read that this is going to there's no
 
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
calculable impact on the uh financial
 
01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
burden based if you include everything
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
right have we done a study how much and
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
who is going to take care of the
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
additional that this
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
bill um yeah this is under their entire
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
retiree plan so there there is no fiscal
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
impact to the
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
state because that that we we as long as
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
we fully fund our retirement plan you
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
know as long as the you know the
 
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
retirement plan is fully funded it's so
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
so what happened is in this case and and
 
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about the some of these
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
health insurance mandates that we passed
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the committee how it only affects a
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
small group of people or only expects
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
the small businesses and the individuals
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
and their insurance companies you know
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
will don't have to uh ra you know they
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
raise the premium to make up for that
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
mandate but when we passed that years
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
ago go I this
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
is I mean this was even before the
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act we had passed it
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay that um
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
obviously uh there were some people who
 
01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
obviously uh there were some people who
weren't

01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.629 align:start position:0%
weren't
included

01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
and that was the state
 
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
employees then what we now became
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
obvious was well not just the state
 
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
employees but what happens if the state
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
employee has
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
retired and they're getting their
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
benefits you know from the this
 
01:31:54.119 --> 01:31:55.149 align:start position:0%
benefits you know from the this
retirement

01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
fund they shouldn't they their kids get
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know still have the benefit they
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't lose it just because they
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're they retired and so that's why
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a minimal cost because we're
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
talking very very few people involved I
 
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
parent right has to pay not out of oh
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
they're actually oh okay I missed that
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
part I forgot about that okay I don't
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
have it in front of nobody's
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
here okay representative miles wasn't
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
the other aspect that they covered
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
without being
 
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
student well that was the that's the key
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
element of the 26 year old right because
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
in the way back when when we first
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
addressed the this issue and this was
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
before like I say it's before Affordable
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
Care Act so we passed this a long time I
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
would say I was not in the chair at the
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
time this was when I was on my
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
sabatical and um the the issue was that
 
01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
we always required that you had to be a
 
01:33:02.119 --> 01:33:03.430 align:start position:0%
we always required that you had to be a
full-time

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
student to be able to get the benefit
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
and is good it's uh just fairness you
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a fairness issue that
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
that everyone else is getting the
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
benefit because under the Affordable
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
Care Act it was mandated so it just the
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
nature of their insurance product is
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
being under this retirement plan it just
 
01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
never got picked up and never got
 
01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.030 align:start position:0%
never got picked up and never got
allowable

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
in that's correct that's been that's
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
now exactly that's that's under under
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act that is how it
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
is it eventually well the Affordable
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
Care Act certainly picked up more people
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
it got the Affordable Care Act got the
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
orisas okay but that uh again that never
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
uh this this retirement plan is a very
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
unique product that was exempt from all
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
regulations so it never got picked up oh
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
so so so as of now the retirement plan
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
basically if they're not students they
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
will not be covered so they no if
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're a student it doesn't matter
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
whether they're student or not they can
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
get the coverage until they're
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
26 and that makes it the same for
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
everybody else in the country that's
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
what this one this B this build does yes
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
so so as of now it's not happening it
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
right at the moment it is not happening
 
01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we need to pass this
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
bill that's why we want to vote ought to
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
pass so they can get the
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
benefit chairman you got it because I
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
know you got confused that last time so
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I got that part the only thing
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
is that I I'm still not clear is that
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
the retirement benefit plan that we're
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
talking about this is the employer the
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
employer is the state so they are the
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
one funding it it's not
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
got left out last time they got left out
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
but it turns out you're saying is it
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
still has money it's still the bill way
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
it read it says in the fiscal note it
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
says however the cost of a dependent's
 
01:35:07.229 --> 01:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
coverage on the retiree plan is
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
$1,044 per month for a non medicare
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
eligible dependent paid entirely by the
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
retiree to the plan right yeah and and
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
the next long as you want to pay $1,000
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
a month you can get the benefit right
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
they get the coverage okay and the next
 
01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
line also I had question that why it
 
01:35:26.109 --> 01:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
says expanding eligibility may increase
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment and potentially increasing
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
cost to the retirement benefit health
 
01:35:30.119 --> 01:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
cost to the retirement benefit health
benefit

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
plan you read you're reading the fiscal
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
note now yeah the the next line say the
 
01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:37.189 align:start position:0%
note now yeah the the next line say the
fiscal

01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
note I know what is he he's asking
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
something about that last phrase well
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
the the line that you read just now next
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
line it say expanding eligability may
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
increase enrollment and claims
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
the potentially inre for the retiree the
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
plan the retiree because the retiree has
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for the insurance plan for their
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
kid okay okay so as long okay so
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
basically there's no there's no
 
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
obligation of burden to the to the after
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
hearing this I would say no one's going
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of this because they
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
can get health insurance cheaper for
 
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.910 align:start position:0%
can get health insurance cheaper for
their

01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
kid okay under the marketplace they
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
could just sign them up individually as
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
an individual and they wouldn't have to
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
do it so this is Feelgood
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
legislation because well I me say this
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
is an opport Unity for somebody who
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
might want to have have their kids on
 
01:36:26.679 --> 01:36:29.430 align:start position:0%
might want to have have their kids on
the

01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
plan kids are really cheap younger it's
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
oh well we had the way the the way
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
there's an age
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
ban okay and the age ban is 4 to one
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
so uh right now I would you know in
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
terms of my employee who was really up
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
there so it's like $1,500 a person so
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
divide that by four now you're down to
 
01:36:52.199 --> 01:36:54.830 align:start position:0%
divide that by four now you're down to
400

01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
400
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
really okay so so for basically if I'm
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
if my understanding correct uh including
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
this is not going to increase the burden
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
on the insurance company or to anybody
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
else except the person who is enrolled
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
in that and they're going to bear the
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
cost Bingo you got it well then no
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
brainer then yes answer absolutely give
 
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.590 align:start position:0%
brainer then yes answer absolutely give
her

01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
explaining okay uh is somebody else did
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
I did I did I sponsor this bill or who
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
did somebody else sponsor this bill
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
who's the
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor okay who anybody would like to
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
rate the blur on this one when we take
 
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
it up
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
so okay so can I ask you one quick
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
curious question if this was this much
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh easy and uh you know
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
no-brainer the why this was not even
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
brought up for last 15 20 years it was
 
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.629 align:start position:0%
brought up for last 15 20 years it was
just

01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
neglected CU life is like
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
that um I have I guess I have to play
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
the tape and see what the the sponsor
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
said and how all of a sudden this she
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
they became attention did anybody
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
remember the hearing you take good notes
 
01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
hearing there wasn't much on this one
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion L know is the
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
only one spoke
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
to the state only so the sponsor wasn't
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
guess just not to ask why they forgot
 
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
about it okay so long oh it's Leno was
 
01:38:43.149 --> 01:38:43.159 align:start position:0%

01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
a former member of the committee so she
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
was she was probably on the committee
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
back when we passed it way back when
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%

two two week or three weeks let's call
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
it that uh so next week um I'm assuming
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
that uh at this point we have not been
 
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
able to get a smaller room so we will
 
01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.910 align:start position:0%
able to get a smaller room so we will
have

01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um in uh down in
 
01:41:01.119 --> 01:41:02.790 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um in uh down in
104

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
104
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
and I tell you what I what I am
 
01:41:07.599 --> 01:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
and I tell you what I what I am
thinking

01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I thought on sucess 78 the last
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
thing we had is she's going to come back
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
in with an amendment I guess nothing no
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
she then without without discussing it
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
with me or anybody she just ran down to
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office and and took out had
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
to have it withdrawn okay um well and
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
you know to be honest
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
is I I explained to her the difficult
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
the problematic issue is the
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement and they lift the statute
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
from I guess New York or and they were
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but other states they the
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's Office of the States
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
you District Attorneys they they're the
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
ones who handle the consumer protection
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
laws okay and and so they contributed a
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection issue so and I said
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
well how where's the enforce Mobility
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
who's who's making sure that that's not
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
getting sold oh no it's the same as we
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
always say the drop a dime you need you
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
know the only time they would worry
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
about it if somebody called up and said
 
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
oh by the way yeah you know you know
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
that that that the health food store was
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
selling selling that so once I explained
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
to her that in the Hampshire we don't do
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
it that way and that theoretically she
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
she would need to have the liquor we
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
need to put it under the Liquor Division
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
and because they're the only ones that
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
are in the out there checking for Aid
 
01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
you know for selling to it and and and I
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
said that but but boy is that going to
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
be awkward yeah and um but it is not so
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
bad in given that pretty much you know
 
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.470 align:start position:0%
bad in given that pretty much you know
every

01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
drugstore and grocer and uh convenience
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
stores because he was talking about
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
convenience stores all of them um sell
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
beer and so therefore the Liquor
 
01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
Commission is already there is already
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
doing the already doing the agent
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement so the only people you're
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to that that's going to be
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
problematic uh is say let's say someone
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
did a popup thing in the in the mall
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
well we've done that too with the Liquor
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
Commission because they do The Vaping
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know there's those PP up vaping
 
01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.030 align:start position:0%
you know there's those PP up vaping
stations

01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
stations
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh so I said that's not so bad so it's
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's not totally it was just it would be
 
01:43:31.470 --> 01:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
it would just be a little awkward for
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know and but the other problem that
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
was wrong with the bill that I felt also
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
not that it makes any difference at this
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
point is that it was very broad some of
 
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
the things that were listed there were
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate vitamins and minerals and
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
things like that that you know I and I
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
said to her I said so let me get this
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
straight so the FDA doesn't regulate any
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
of these things that you want be worried
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
about whether they're over 18 by how the
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
heck are we going to you know
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
rationalize that enforcement I I
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
couldn't see
 
01:44:01.639 --> 01:44:03.750 align:start position:0%
couldn't see
it

01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
exactly so um instead of us killing it
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
she was afraid that that means she
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't bring it back next year so by
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
withdrawing it she can come back with
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
something could we have oh well what
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I told her I do I said I
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
said I said to her that out of on you
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
know we would you know this but she
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
didn't want to our reputation I don't
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
know how you do it on other committees
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
but in our committee is is we understand
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
that you're in a pickle and that this is
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know you're going to do a lot of you
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
know have to figure out how you how do
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
you want to do this and how how you're
 
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
going to spin it that you know you can
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
retain it and we'll take it up in
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
September and see what you got the
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that you got do that she she
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
had already already had gone to house
 
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
clerk to have it withdrawn and okay of
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
course my ation with TR is this is this
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
something we voted for you oh yeah yeah
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
we've all voted for this go I don't know
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
some but but it's you know obviously for
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
me it's a know we' you know we've never
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
had this withdrawal process but to me
 
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
the once a bill has been introduced and
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
certainly after we've had the hearing
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
that bill belongs to this committee it
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong to the sponsor but we
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have the hearing we did have the
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
here no we didn't we did no the first
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
thing she said she was here and the
 
01:45:25.229 --> 01:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
first thing she said I want to withdraw
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
this bill that was the only thing that
 
01:45:28.109 --> 01:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
was ever said that's a different bill
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
but no no it was this bill it was this
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
bill and she said she wanted to withdraw
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
it that's and that was all that was said
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
no no I'm saying it was Nome we had Nome
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
in Leno say please Nome and Leno were
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
the ones who came in and spoke for it
 
01:45:46.109 --> 01:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
that's it I have it on my video I typed
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
it up last night really if she's
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
withdrawing it it doesn't matter all
 
01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
that much when she withdrew it yeah that
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
is absolutely true represent again okay
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%

if we get into that fourth and things
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
are not going well I mean in terms of
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
the glucose spill for instance if we're
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%

01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
what we're doing um uh you know if

an email he's when I I send him the
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and he says he wants to talk
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
to me about it because he doesn't know
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
where what we're doing Le though we
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
can't read the bill or something I don't
 
01:48:14.430 --> 01:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
know but he wants to talk about it so if
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
any of these bills go south on on the
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%

01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
well yeah on the fifth we'll just retain

01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we can be Flex if you
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
guys are suddenly into an exec session
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that so let's say in the order of
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
priorities um you're executing if you
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
exec anything on the fourth that's the
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
higher priority so that we will
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate you not to be in Commerce
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
okay um but if you're um if you're just
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
doing a hearing then then you can come
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
on down
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that okay that's fine all right and
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
we'll know and you'll feel you know what
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
Happ I'll let you
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but otherwise Wednesday the 5th is
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um a dday for all executing all 13 bills
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
that I have to we have to have out of
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
committee that's right
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay will you keep track of who's going
 
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
to be writing blurbs because I remember
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
that worked out well when you send out a
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
list of this person is writing I I will
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm doing now so that when
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
we when we uh so and because my my
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
intention is as usual that by we get to
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
the fifth we'll already know what we're
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
action we're going to take and I'll have
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
who's going to make the motion and who
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
needs to have the blur and they need to
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
