terms of several of the bills which we
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%

real good recommendations and findings

the bill the amendment all of amendments
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
non-gain seeing that we're talking about
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
different sections of Statute we're not
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
talking necessarily consolidation we
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
aren't talking consolidation we aren't
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
talking merger we're looking at
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
strategies to uh address the issues
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
which we have at higher education and
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
coming up with some great strategies and
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so what we're going to have to do so
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
we won't be discussing 1450 today we
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh where that will be held and we will
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
have here helping to explain some of
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
that uh folks from the University system
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
community college system uh from that
 
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519 align:start position:0%
executive uh the the governor's uh task
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
force to uh explain this amendment so
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
that that's where we are on that so none
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the bills from last Monday will be
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
discussed today so now we're looking at
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
the bills dealing with the qu operative
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
you school districts the merging all
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
that dealing with the structure
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
organization of of these uh these
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
particular uh uh methods of governing
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
education in the
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
state and I'm going to do this in such a
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
way we're going to introduce the you
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
know the first we will have discussion I
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
will invite discussion from sponsors if
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
they want to engage in this which I
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
think it will be very very helpful and
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh so with that in mind I'd like to
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
start right off with uh HB
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
1195 this bill is relative to allowing
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
school districts to approve
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
different apportionment methods for
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
school administrative unit cost so we're
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
not talking co-ops in this thing we're
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
talking about the school administrative
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
units saus and and an apportionment meth
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
methods which we have here so um 1195
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
everybody should try to open up that
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
1195 and of course as as usual I left
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%

00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
let's let's maybe we'll try address
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
those you know together but this one
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
first um I'm going to open this up to
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
discussion so that
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
um these topics that we're dealing with
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
today are really important topics uh and
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
I I want to make sure that we're going
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
to you know uh try to get a direction
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
where we're going with these that's
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
going to be really beneficial for every
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
year I've been here there's been bills
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
on saus and a lot of bills on co-ops and
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're still having them come in
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
and and like a a retread Tire it keeps
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
coming around so 1195 open to discussion
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
right now is anybody want to discuss
 
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.470 align:start position:0%
right now is anybody want to discuss
this

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
1195 including a member of the public
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
well represent
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Cordell thank you um I think there has
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
been some discussion about um the uh
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
abortion method in saus and um we had
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
testimony um from a written testimony
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
from uh the uh Board of
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
Selectmen um in
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
Newton um and confirmed in 194
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
C9 um that um the only apportionment
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
method in the uh statute is half
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment and half um uh equal
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
valuation yeah equalized valuation thank
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
you um so this just wants to open it up
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
um to other me methods that might be
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
worked out um within the
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
SAU um you know I'm not sure I can't
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
recall specific details of um what they
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to change or if there was
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
agreement on a method they wanted to
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
change it
 
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
change it
to

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
um but uh you know I'm I'm certainly
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
open to um allowing greater flexibility
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
there I
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
think further discussion on that
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I brought this up
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
the other day and I haven't heard any um
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
any good argumentation as to why I would
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
be wrong about it and I would certainly
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
open to hearing why I'm wrong about this
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
but it does seem to me that if if
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement in place that that
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
localities have entered into to be under
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
one of these organizations under a
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
certain apportionment method
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
that then can be changed by a majority
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
vote it would seem that it could further
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
disadvantage certain localities that are
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
already possibly
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged um by virtue of a simple
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
majority vote in that is not in
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
accordance with the original agreement
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
that was entered into um again i' would
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
love to hear if there's any good reason
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
you yes represent Bon thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
um Mr desan is right here and you can
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
ask him
 
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:42.029 align:start position:0%
ask him
directly

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
sure again Paul to Shan I'm with the
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
town of Newington and addressed you back
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
in January and thank you very much for
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak with you again
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh to your specific uh question a very
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
good question um I believe though under
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh one 95
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
C2 it's one subsection 1-8 um there's a
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
planning committee that's voted to be
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
established that then would talk about
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
if if they were able to talk about um
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
abortions right now the statute is so
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
fixed you can't even talk about it um
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
because there is no agreement the
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
statute says it will be 1 half one2 so
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
there's never ever a discussion relative
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
to the apportionment um in the seu
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
situation and even if the comes back
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation to change that
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
abortion and it still needs a 3- fifths
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
U majority vote um by this dist member
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
school districts of the SAU so so it's
 
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
not as practical or easy as just you
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
know who who Who's the biggest thumb on
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
the scale so to speak uh it has to be a
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
super majority in order to uh enact
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
those type of changes so there has to be
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
a you know real mutual agreement as to
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
what that aort apportionment may be
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
other than the one half one half if this
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation is
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
enacted represent dry thank you and
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um when we
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
talked about Cooperative school
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
districts on Monday morning we noticed
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the those agreements 955
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
6040 all those um but uh so I I agree
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
that it we should be able to talk about
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
those kind of things because obviously
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
they work in the real world but what we
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
noticed was missing how to get out of
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
that if he doesn't do it and maybe
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
requiring something um of that nature
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
would that work in this situation as
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
well this is not a co-op I know it's not
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
a co-op but I mean you're still in the
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
same situation you're you're you're in
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
some place maybe you don't like and how
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
do you how do you change it the the
 
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
process is the same under u u 95 C2 um
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
you start a planning committee the
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
committee does this study has a
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation then there's a vote on
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
the recommendation
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the recommendation only could be uh
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
adopted by 3 fifths um so so there's a
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place and I would also add
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
um from what I heard from Monday's
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
testimony seems like a lot of these
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts entered
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
into the agreements when they were kind
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
of new and fashionable I hope by you
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
know the many decades that we've
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
experienced uh we've all learned from
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
that uh and we would come back uh with a
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
much uh more practical uh solution at
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
least in the SAU situation uh that I'm
 
00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
advocating for thank you thank you for
 
00:25:29.559 --> 00:25:30.510 align:start position:0%
advocating for thank you thank you for
your

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.029 align:start position:0%
your
question

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
further yes represent M thank you Mr
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
chair as I understand this proposal is
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
basically an enabling
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislation so it doesn't prescribe how
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
it should be done but it actually
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
provides a greater opportunity for
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
people to look at different ways of
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
looking this rather than what is
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
currently prescribed in the law is that
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
correct that is exactly correct
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
represent repres Bel thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to POS a hypothetical and
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
I hope anybody can answer it as to as to
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
why this wouldn't be the case let's take
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical where we have 10 uh local
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
political divisions towns that are put
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
together into one of these groups and
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
they want to look at a different
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
apportionment method and the
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
apportionment method they look at it and
 
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559 align:start position:0%
you have you have nine of the towns in
 
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
category that would be benefited um by
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
this and one town that would be severely
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
on the other side of things perhaps even
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
at thee let's say it shifts 90% of the
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
cost of business to one
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
town uh away from the other nine towns
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh and the other nine towns would
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
probably want to vote for that so what
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
recourse under that circumstance with
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
that one town who is now going to be
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
saddled with such a huge huge burden um
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
what what recourse would they have under
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
under this law if we passed it okay now
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
we also have Barrett who's been he's
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
been right through this whole thing you
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
ask represent vure so uh Barrett would
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
you come on up and sit beside there so
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
we have the school boards Association
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
here as well uh seeing we're trying
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
to get some because the represent beler
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
asked a real important question thank
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you much chair man lad good
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee for the
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
record bar Christina from the school
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
boards Association representative beler
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
is I'm reading the bill um line three it
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
says as the constituent school districts
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
May approve person to RSA 194 C2 I'm
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
interpreting that as long in in addition
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
to the alternative budget methods in 194
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
c9a and B that in order for the
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
alternative method to be approved each
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
individual School District within the
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
SAU would have to approve it so I'm
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
going to take an example of sa67 which
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
is dun Barton and Bo Bo the the bo
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
voters would have to approve the
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
alternative method and the Dunbarton
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
voters would have to approve the
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
alternative method at their respective
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
annual meetings in order for a a a
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
different me a different apportionment
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
method to be implemented I don't I'm not
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
interpreting the bills you would take a
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
totality of the votes SAU wide and the
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
plurality town could carry with whatever
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted that's how I'm interpreting
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
it that each individual town would have
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
to adopt it at their own local annual
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
meeting thank you is that an
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation or is that in statute so
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
um in in 194 C 194
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
C9 um it says you know each School
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
District this is alternative budget
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
procedure method for adoption each
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
School District within an SAU that is
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
composed of two or more districts may
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
vote to adopt the provisions of RSA 194
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
c9b to determine the means for adopting
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
the SAU budget by placing the question
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
on the warrant of their next annual
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
School District meeting so it says each
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
district this is again 194 c9a paragraph
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
1A each district places it on at their
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
annual at their annual
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
meeting the the the proposed bill is is
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
not as explicit as that but I mean I I I
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
think I would hope reasonable Minds
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
would interpret it the same way that we
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
were be that we're reading the
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
alternative methods in 194 C9 A and B
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yes represent luno
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and and a
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
sort of a follow on question uh along
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
this sort of line of discussion um as
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
well if um if a um if a district wanted
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
to uh withdraw from the seu let's say
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
the aoran was not it was very
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
unfavorable to that District as
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher uh was was was
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
prop hypothetically um U proposing uh a
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
a District fall after a study and a plan
 
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:00.909 align:start position:0%
a District fall after a study and a plan
can

00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
unilaterally remove itself from the
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
district with a from the seu with a
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
three-fifths vote is that correct the
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
decision to leave an SAU or withdraw
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
from an SAU is that District specific it
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
is not a vote SAU wide as it is with the
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
co-op thank you yeah thank good
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
clarification uh represent Terry oh uh
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh gentlemen I'm on line four
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
here actually let's you begin at the end
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
of line three the schooled
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
administrative unit board may use such
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
other methods that's fine as the
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
approve what's the what is the Practical
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
meaning of
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
May I think you just explained that you
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
believe you would interpret that to mean
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
that each of the constituent school
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
districts would have to
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
approve so what is the operationally
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
here and functionally why is the word
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
may here rather than shall sure or
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily must right thank you for the
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
question representative I mean I'm I'm
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing that as just enabling
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
language I I understand your your
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation um but it's saying that
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
the school board may use the alternative
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
oh I see as the the SAU board may use
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
alternative may use other such methods
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
as a constituent school districts you're
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
saying did approve
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
or well wouldn't that be required isn't
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about here all
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
school districts need to approve of this
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
then why is the word may there rather
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
than shall necessarily right I think if
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
if I understand if the constituent
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
districts are approving the alternative
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
method then the SAU board shall use that
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
method is that what you're trying to say
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
sir yes okay but the trigger is that
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
each of the districts has to approve the
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
the language needs to be worked on here
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
to clarify otherwise it's in my view and
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
I'm realizing I'm coming in later but
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's very ambiguous and could be easily
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted be May is permissive
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
typically and what we want here is is uh
 
00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:16.909 align:start position:0%
typically and what we want here is is uh
is

00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
definition that it is
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
required that each School District must
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
in order
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
for an alternative method to be employed
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
so and suiz you have where you are Paul
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
so you would read that last line four
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
going on to five such other methods as
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
con uh constituent school districts
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
approv pursuant to taking the May out
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
the second May
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes but but to be clear about it you
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
know must
 
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.710 align:start position:0%
know must
approve

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
prior to i' rework I spent some time
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
reworking the language but I think we're
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
all clear on the school districts each
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
of the school districts must approve of
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
the the method before it can be
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
triggered it's not so so we we need to
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
get precise language here and I'm not
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
sure that just by removing the word may
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
satisfies I have I'd have to that thank
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
you and just to follow up on that very
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
good point I I would say I think the
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
problem in that language I see is
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
actually the tense because May approve
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
is speculative in this sense that
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
suggests something that may happen in
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
the future but this actually has to have
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
happened before so the language should
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
say have approved or just PL approved or
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
have approved is in like it's already
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
been done yeah yes past
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
tense further discussion representative
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes I'm trying to catch up
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
here so um I'm wondering if if there
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
would need to be any kind of process
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
like a public hearing on this a special
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
way to make sure the um voters
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
understand is that in statute or does
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
that need to be added thank you for that

vote
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
occurs yes so you said 195 C2 excuse me
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
194 194 C can you say can you
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
so it requires a public can you tell me
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
all the things that are required what it
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
all the things that are required in
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
194c yeah it's subsections 1 through
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
eight yeah it's a lengthy process there
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
it talks about three fifths and all this
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
other so there's a lot to this
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
process and and the vote has to be what
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
three fifths three fifths three three
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
fifths of each
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
yes yeah Mr chair yes go ahead right and
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
and you know I I think we could go ahead
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
with with with this bill uh you know you
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
know 194 C2 is the method that's that's
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
used to determine apportionment and like
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
I like we you know talked about there's
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
always the parachute rip cord if if um
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
if a district uh doesn't like the um the
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
the result of of that and that's
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
completely up to the district um itself
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
so so uh you know I think um I I think
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
um um uh representative Terry has an
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
interesting interpretation of that but
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh but from a practical standpoint I
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't think an amendment's really
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
necessary to move this forward and if it
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
was it could be done in the Senate we
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
would have no thank you the the that
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment would simply just change the
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
tents of approved to approved well said
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
would it would it would basically say
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
the process for approval is C2 and CU
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
there is no other process for uh for
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
approval yeah so you don't have an
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
option of not using C2 right
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
right Is there further discussion
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yes I I would
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
just like to say that I worked at the
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for 32 years and
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
over that period I've seen a lot of um
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
districts want to withdraw from an SAU
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
and they and usually the reason is they
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
think that they're paying more than
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
their share of uh paying paying more
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
than their share but getting less than
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
their than a equal share from of
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
attention from the sa so saus have
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
broken up because of that I think that
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
that this maybe will would help some of
 
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
the saus Stay Together better because
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
they would have the option to say well
 
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
we understand understand why this town
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
that you know has 10% of the students in
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
paying 45% of the of the cost might want
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
to get out and it gives them the
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to adjust that so that
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
the that town would want to
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
stay okay is there a further discussion
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
from where we are on the bill right now
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
we have two folks sitting
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
here thank you very much I don't see any
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
further need appreciate your input today
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
so so back to the committee here as a
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
whole um I I I I've I've heard
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
two with that lines four and five um
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
tents and I I heard must but if you
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
write in approved you know that's a past
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
tense that means is done pursuant to
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
that um or I've heard the other
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion that it's good the way it
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
is so I guess where we are is that uh
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just what we're going to be
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
doing today do with these bills because
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
we have so very few of them um I'd like
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
to have you know and I've mentioned to
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
the ranking represent on the other side
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
we will take some caucuses throughout so
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
we can wind up and figure out where we
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
are so we're going to take a very brief
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
caucus right now do you want to do the
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
other well yeah yeah and it's represent
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
cordelli has another good point earlier
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
this morning we have been discussing
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
these these co-ops and them and Theus
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
with some folks for over an hour and we
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
have another bill here also dealing with
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
this uh 1579 yeah
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
1579 um Rel to the merging of school
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
administrative units so let's at the
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
um it it's dealing with the same
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
organization or the same in uh
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
governance structure but from a
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
different angle here so 1579 is relative
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
at that before we you know get into the
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%

discussion and for those that are new to
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
the committee today we're having this
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
these discussions a little bit with the
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
executive session seeing that we've had
 
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
107 bills we just have not had the time
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
to deal with some of the ins and outs on
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
bills which a little bit more time might
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
give us more information so that's what
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing and uh hopefully um this
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
making okay I think everybody has a copy
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
of that right now representative Pell
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
will you just walk out of the
 
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.069 align:start position:0%
will you just walk out of the
room

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
okay good go ahead represent Celli yes
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
um I believe that um the main um change
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
in this was uh on line 8 changing the
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
1500 uh students to 12200 students and
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
here comes Pell uh represent Pell can
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
ball sorry thank you yes um the
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
amendment does just just um dropped down
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
the number of um the merging number the
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
sorry the number of students in the
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
merging districts to from 1500 to 12200
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
and that was based on um some
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
conversation that I that was heard
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
during the um committee hear the initial
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
hearing so since then I've heard um
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
maybe why have any number at all because
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
maybe some smaller districts um would be
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
interested in merging and I would have
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
no problem with them mending that to
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate that the whole purpose of this
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
bill was just to
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
encourage districts to merge because um
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
the number of Administrators has just
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
been increasing significantly more than
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
the number of um direct teaching staff
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the students and we want to make some
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
of those changes I have information to
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
pass around also on the number of um ad
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
administrators the number of pupils per
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
administrators and this is information
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
we got we received from the Department
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
of Education um for
 
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.829 align:start position:0%
of Education um for
example

00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
um this is coming around but some of the
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
districts are significantly topheavy
 
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.990 align:start position:0%
districts are significantly topheavy
so

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
um for example colbrook has 43 students
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
per SAU
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
staff um London d
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
in contrast has 2117 pupils per SAU
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
staff um I think Manchester if I believe
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
best yeah Manchester was let's see White
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
Mountain Regional has up 150 students
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
per SAU
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
staff so there's quite a discrepancy now
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
Mar Mach Valley has 267 pupils per SAU
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
staff so that's the far right column of
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
the um spreadsheet that I'm passing
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
now okay so we can discuss this right
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
now um I I guess I'm in concurrence with
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative panel that I prefer to
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
see no number 1500 1200 I like to see no
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
number seeing that there are many
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
schools in my saus in my neck of the
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
woods which have small numbers to begin
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
with it' be good to see even a couple of
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
them joining and it wouldn't come up to
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
even a thousand kids but the issue which
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
we're having in the North country is
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
that these saus cover a whole lot of
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
territory and we have folks that for
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
example the SAU office provides special
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
education services and other you know
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
Services which are are delivered to all
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
the participating towns or districts in
 
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.030 align:start position:0%
the participating towns or districts in
that

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:57.309 --> 00:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
SAU sometimes we have people driving 60
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
Mi one way and so that creates a need
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
for more staff if you're going to have
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
that service provided uh when it's
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
needed in these schools especially when
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
it comes to special education so that's
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
why you're going to see some lower
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
ratios for the you know the those
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
smaller districts those saus which have
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of territory and C Brook C
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
certainly has a lot of territory up that
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
way so that's just a brief comment right
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
there represent
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
Ry thank you I'd like to itate re
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
iterate that yes it's going to come up
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
in planfield and cornish's um Town
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
meetings on Saturday um and between the
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
two districts we have 300 students so I
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
would be um inclined to go with no
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
number represent
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
cordelli so am am I correct if we
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate um lines eight and nine the
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
number then we could also eliminate uh d
 
00:45:52.839 --> 00:45:54.270 align:start position:0%
number then we could also eliminate uh d
and

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
e from a new Amendment
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
I think e could be amended to line 24 on
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment would be um change to all
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
school districts served by the newly
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
merged school administr administrative
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
unit shall be eligible for the
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
consolidation Grant correct yes thank
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon and then
 
00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.829 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon and then
representative

00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
luno thank you Mr chair I have a
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
question on the amendment different from
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
what we've been
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
discussing um it seems true to remove
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
line 9 and 10 from the original bill in
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
regards to specifying that this doesn't
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
it references pre-existing Co-op school
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
districts why was that
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
removed thank you I heard comments from
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
multiple people that there was no reason
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
not to include Cooperative districts so
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
we removed it that was from the doe and
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
from um other organizations that gave us
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
input after the initial bill had been
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
submitted follow
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
yes so just to clarify then existing
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts would
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
qualify to consolidate under this Bill
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes like I said after after we
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
submitted this original Bill we received
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
feedback from other and so that's why we
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
have this amendment in fact when
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney presented the
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
bill we he came with an amendment
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
already thank you per s
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and um
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
and and thank you representative
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
peternell for the uh for the amendment
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
here I would um um I I agree that the
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment's going in the right direction
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
I agree with eliminating lines 8 and N
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I'd also suggest eliminating lines 10
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
and 11 uh so that saus can uh can make
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
their own um organizational um uh and uh
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
and man uh management decisions and um
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
and and and and eliminating lines 24 25
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
26 that all goes along with that
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
um uh um I I I think the uh the
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
financial incentive is is is strong and
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's important um I'm concerned
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
survivability of the uh of The Proposal
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
with the with the financial cost in it
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
but i' I'd like to see the fin I'd like
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
to see the 200 stay uh the $200
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
incentive stay in there um but um but
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just putting it out there as a as a
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
concern um I I think the the honestly
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
the most important piece is that um is
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
that the uh C2 is is is basically
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
amended to say that mergers are possible
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
as well not just creation withdrawal and
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
things like that so
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair further further
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
discussion yes thank you I um disagree
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
with eliminating lines 10 and 11 because
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
part of the purpose of
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill is to limit the number of
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
administrative staff and there is a time
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
frame this will sunset on July 1st 2026
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm not overly concerned
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
with the longevity of the
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
grants on um line 17 y
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on it representa
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
Cornell well lines 10 and 11 when it
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
says have only one superintendent or
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
person responsible for superintendent
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent because if you have a
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
district all the size of man if they end
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
up being the size of Manchester and this
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
chart is actually wrong because we have
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
more than one assistant superintendent
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
for almost 12,000
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
students once again this is a bill which
 
00:49:58.599 --> 00:50:00.190 align:start position:0%
students once again this is a bill which
is

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
allowing decisions to made be made at
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
the local
 
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.270 align:start position:0%
the local
level

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
and well well that's that's what I'm
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
addressing um so you know I I'm I I
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
think the bill itself is absolutely
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
needed we need to be able to merge these
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
districts for a lot of different reasons
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
um you're still going to have huge
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs you're going to
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
still have when you're merging you're
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to figure out which
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
buildings are going to be the receiving
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
elementary kids which are the middle of
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
the high school kids so there's going to
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
be a whole lot going on there and when
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
you do merge districts together you have
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
various New Towns and districts there
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
walking in a superintendent shoes you
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
know you're going to be out every darn
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
night for some kind of a school board
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
meeting in one of those districts so
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's they went through trying to
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
consolidate over in Vermont and what
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
they found out that even through
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
consolidation their administrative costs
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
did not shrink yeah it was just a given
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
and represent Leon um thank you thank
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um we actually have a
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
bit of a real word example of what
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
happens with consolidation and
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
administrative roles the dairy is now
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to be outdated because we have
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
closed one of our schools da Village
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
School and there were two new
 
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
administrative positions made in the SAU
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
and in order to allow the principal and
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
vice principal to stay on um so we need
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the very compassionate
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
idea of trying to make sure that people
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
keep their jobs um isn't outweighed by
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that people need to keep their
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
homes uh by having an appropriately
 
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.069 align:start position:0%
homes uh by having an appropriately
scaled

00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
scaled
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
Administration and um I think that the
 
00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:48.799 align:start position:0%
line language on lines nine and 10 that
 
00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
may make it so that it's only
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do this merger for some
 
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
school districts but the question is is
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
it better to enable this for some school
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
districts where it's a good fit or try
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
and have a solution that works for
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
everybody and just keep repeating the
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
same challenges we've seen through all
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
of our attempts to consolidate uh we
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
just we're going through this right now
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
and everything the school board wanted
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
was uh shot down on the on the ballot
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday so we want to make sure that
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
whatever we we do going forward and
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
whatever we enable for the districts
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't cause more confusion within the
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
towns represent cordelli and then
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thank you I think
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
lines 10 and 11 11 really just State um
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
what is in statute elsewhere and that um
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
you can have a superintendent but as
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
long as you have someone to perform
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent Services that's fined
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
also according to current statute so I I
 
00:52:47.069 --> 00:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
I don't really see the the problem with
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
10 and 11 because it's um as I said it's
 
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
a restatement I as I read it of current
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
law repres luno thank you
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
I if it's if it's already in current law
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere else I think that's reason to
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
take out lines 10 and 11 um currently I
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
think lines 10 11 would um would in some
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
cases prohibit a uh a district from uh
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
from merging with another SAU and if the
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
goal here is to encourage districts to
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh to merge have multiple districts
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
served by a single SAU having
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on that um uh would seem to
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
be problematic uh in fact um in fact the
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
way the way the law stands right now A
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
District could uh leave its current or
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
you know abandon its own SAU you know
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
following a study following the process
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
and C2 and join with another um merge
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
with a with a with another SAU under
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
current law a district could do that
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
right now it's not specified but they
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
could do that right now now with this
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
new law they would only be able to merge
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh with another seu with all of these
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
limitations in place with all of these
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions in place so for a lot of
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
districts they'd say no you know what we
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
can't do it we um for for whatever
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
reason we don't meet the the 12200
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
although I think we're all in agreement
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
to uh to eliminate that but um but uh I
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
I I I would I you know current law
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
provides the flexibility that's there if
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
this law is intended to encourage
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
merging it does it with the $200 per
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
pupil incentive and uh and really that
 
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
should be that should be all that's in
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
here further further discussion
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
representa pen then representative Damon
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is an incentive Grant
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
and the incentive is to limit the top
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
down Administration and so I
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
100% disagree with removing lines 10 and
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
11 because that is the entire purpose of
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
this bill then then how would how
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
wa okay let's just put your hand up
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
please okay uh represent Damon then
 
00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:12.270 align:start position:0%
please okay uh represent Damon then
represent

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
Luna thank you so I think in life one
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
size fits-all generally is a
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
falsehood and line 10 and 11 attempts to
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
be one size fits all but depending on
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
the student population of the district
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
the geography the number of communities
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
it may simply not be realistic to have
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
only one superintendent so I really or
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent level of services I would
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
really agree with removing lines 10 and
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
11 so that more districts can seriously
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
great representative luno was next no no
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
then representative cordelli and then
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative pno per me
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
I had my hand oh repr Le I didn't see it
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead repres
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
Le um following up on rep what rep
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
penell said and what rep luno said
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
currently districts can
 
00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:17.630 align:start position:0%
currently districts can
merge

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
merge
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
and have as me and do it however they
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
want and have the um superintendence and
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
Etc as they want the idea with this bill
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
is in addition to what they could
 
00:56:29.839 --> 00:56:30.829 align:start position:0%
is in addition to what they could
already

00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
do if they want this
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
grant they're going to agree to limit
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
their superintendent to just one so this
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
is just providing another way of merging
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
and the point is to reduce
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
that top superintendent you know the top
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
administrative section so if you want
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
the money you limit if you don't want
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
the the money do whatever you want
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
represent pel if the districts already
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
have two superintendents and they
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
merge how can you have more than one
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent because you have to have
 
00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.829 align:start position:0%
superintendent because you have to have
one

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
boss we only have one
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
Governor but so they they might create
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
new positions for assistant
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
superintendence but there's still only
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
one superintendent for the
 
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.309 align:start position:0%
one superintendent for the
SAU

00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
represent Luna thank thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
so so I think the the concern I and I
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
agree you're you're only going to have
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
one superintendent the same way a
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
company only has one CEO but you may
 
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:41.559 align:start position:0%
have um uh more than one person
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for superintendent duties
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
because uh those dut the super you can
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
see the superintendent Duties are
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
enumerated and I don't even remember the
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
section of law but but it's like a mile
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
long you know it's as long as my arm and
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
so you might have multiple people doing
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
that there' still only be one
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
superintendent but um but so the that's
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know that that I think is another
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
reason why 10 and 11 should be
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
eliminated lines 10 and 11 should be
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
eliminated the other thing that I think
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
is is um
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um may not be uh a correct
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation is although the law and
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
although current law C2 does not talk
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
about mergers this section is about
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
mergers and I think any merger would be
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
limited to the terms in this in this
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
section so unless you followed all the
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions in here you'd not be able
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
to merge saus you would not have the
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
benefit of the uh the Omission in
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
existing law uh with respect to um to
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
mergers this would be the the section
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
that that directs how mergers would be
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
done further discussion yes represent
 
00:58:57.039 --> 00:58:58.029 align:start position:0%
done further discussion yes represent
thank

00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
you I'm wondering if this perhaps could
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
be resolved by
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
removing in line
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
11 or person responsible for
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent duties so the bill would
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
still require only one superintendent
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
one one boss one
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
CEO but it would not State a limit on
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
how the broad long arm of superintendent
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
Duties are accomplished what number of
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
other positions there might
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
be represent belra and then represent uh
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chair this has been a
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
productive debate and as we've gone
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
through it uh something has kind of
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
clicked with me that is a cause for some
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
some lesser concern that I think could
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
be easily fixed um I like the idea
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
behind what we're trying what this is
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish the the trouble I
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
see is that there isn't always a rhyme
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
or a reason to the expansion of
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy even as we've had the
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
reduction in the total number of
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
students enrolled we've had more
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
administrative positions being created
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
my concern is if we encourage with a
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
financial incentive towns that come
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
together or seus that come together and
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
merge we might actually have an
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
equalization in the opposite direction
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
toward a greater bureaucracy instead of
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
a lesser bureaucracy so i' I'd very much
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
like to see uh a minor amendment made
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
that only makes the financial incentive
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
available if the merger results in a net
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
staff Ron Dr you were next up thank you
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to find the bill that
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
we are also looking on that defines that
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
a person can take over the
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of superintendent
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
without being the superintendent and
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
just think adding that to the mix as
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
we're discussing
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
it yeah we discussed that with single
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
school districts uh and that is the
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
principal who has a master's degree but
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
just because a master's degree does not
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily guarantee you being able to
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
take over the superintendent Services
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
has to be reviewed by the department to
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that within that master's degree
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
the courses that are necessary for those
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
services are there if they're not there
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
so it's uh I think we went through that
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
and that might be a person that's
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
running the
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
other SAU right yes you're correct uh
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you my
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
um to uh change lines 10 and 11 uh to
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
read the proposed merger merg Su school
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
administrative unit shall have only one
 
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.039 align:start position:0%
superintendent or Personnel responsible
 
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
for superintendent duties pursuant to
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
194 C5 Roman 2A which is the statute um
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
that talks about uh superintendent
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
Services being performed uh by one or
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
more administrative Personnel for or
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
part-time or Services independently
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
contracted can you repeat the um RSA
 
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:31.829 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion represent
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
Damon Mr chair would it be appropriate
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
to ask to hear from Mr Christina on
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if he has anything
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
wants to inut to us do you have a
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
specific question no I just like his
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
perspective yeah we're open to it thank
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
you you're
 
01:02:54.839 --> 01:03:01.109 align:start position:0%
you you're
welcome

01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman L good morning
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
members of the uh committee again I you
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
say Roman I don't without a specific
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
question um I mean and I'll be honest
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
with you I kind of multitasking back
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
there I was not listening intently to
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
every word that was being set up here I
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that I enjoy all my
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
time here sometimes I have other things
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
I have to get to as well respectfully so
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
I mean you know I mean I don't you know
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
if if if nhba didn't take a position on
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
the bill if there's a if there's an
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
incentive that can be you know if if
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
this committee can find language to
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
create an incentive for saus to to merge
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
and perhaps cut administrative costs so
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
be it I think money money is always a
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
great incentive you know it's usually
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
the best incentive um but I mean I don't
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
I don't we don't have a position on the
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
on the on the bill per se representative
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli I did hear you sort of mirror
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
the language from C5 that would that
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
would be fine um I should just as as a
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
point of background there is one SAU in
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
the state that has two superintendant
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about an assistant
 
01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent they have two
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
superintendant sa53 which is Pembrook
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
Deerfield Epsom Chai Chester and
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
Allenstown they have two
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
superintendant um one superintendent um
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
is basically responsible for Pembrook
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
and Deerfield and the other
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent is responsible for the
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the three other districts in that in
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
that SAU but their their co-s
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
superintendence if you will but that's
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
the only one that I'm that I'm aware of
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
state this state is really got it all
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't it wow yeah that is a wow yeah I
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
agree you know I I think that
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative Celli's suggestion here
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
to replace that with 194 C5 Roman 2A is
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
good that's fine and I think that would
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
just work in fine there for that that
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
line that we're you know we don't want
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
to be telling their they want to merge
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea to merge because
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of cost
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
savings hopefully
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully but um it's it's it's allowing
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
that to occur right and there's an you
 
01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
have to have the incentive you're going
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
to have to come up with some incentive
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
to get districts to do it or else we're
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to see the breaking apart of saus
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
like we've seen the last 20 years or so
 
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
yeah yes you have a clarifying question
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Christina so with
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's proposed C5 um
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
language uh
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
f after the part that says um have only
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
one superintendent comma and then you've
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
got the C5 language in there would would
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
that provide the um the I I guess
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
administrative flexibility to make to
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
for a district to have a school business
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
officer responsible for the
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent financial
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities yeah thank you I think
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
it would um representative uh luno you
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned the laundry list of respon
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
superintendent responsibilities under C4
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative Cordell you
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you know or person who
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
can provide those Services the the
 
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
laundry list of stuff that's done under
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
C4 we know it's not the superintendent
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
that's doing that it's delegated you
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
know the first one I think is payroll we
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
know the superintendent is not is not
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
running payroll there's a business
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
office that's taking care of that so you
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
know we've always said there's an
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
inherent authority of that list in C4 um
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
where the superintendent has Authority
 
01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
just either not even statutory Authority
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
but just inherent authority of the way a
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
business is operated to delegate to the
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
rest of the administrative staff or the
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
building level
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
staff okay thank you thank
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you I mean this has been an
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
interesting discussion I think it's
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
important to note that if somebody's
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to merge my sense is they're
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
looking at an economy of scale
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
here so you're not
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
the merging and having increased costs
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
is duplicative of what the intent is so
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
I think the perhaps represent cordelli
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion would solve at least that
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
thing I I can't imagine that if you're
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
going to merge two districts you're
 
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
going to increase the management of that
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
because you're trying to decrease the
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
management of it and so I think that uh
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
obviously this is an important piece
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
because I think we do need to look to
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
see where we can have mergers of school
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
districts across the state but I think
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're kind of denying the local decision
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
making around this is why they're doing
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
this and it's not to increase the cost
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
but it's to decrease the cost and that
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
obviously has to deal with your Topline
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
management and the uh cost for those
 
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
management and the uh cost for those
respective

01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
respective
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
positions and this all puts the onus on
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
the school districts that are merging to
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
do a feasibility study that's going to
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
be sustainable into the future and give
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
these you know efficiency of scale that
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and so I I think
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
this is a a great idea and I think
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative pel has is right on the
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
course here and I think with the
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
additions that we've talked about I I'm
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
prepared to try to move forward with it
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
myself yes represent Leia um thank you I
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring the bring us back
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
to the real world example the voters of
 
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
Dair thought that we'd have less
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
overhead by closing a school and that's
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
why they supported it but the overhead
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
has not decreased so we shouldn't assume
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
that all school boards will actually
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
take that as their mandate to decrease
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
the overhead while merging unfortunately
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
that doesn't always happen so we need to
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that when we enable something
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
we include the appropriate
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
protections representative Fells you had
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
your hand up too I believe I just um I'm
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that you might want to give
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
some consideration to situations where
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
you have those really small school
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
districts uh examp Hill would be an
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
example they were part of the sa with
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
Franklin but they pulled out of that a
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
few years ago and if they want to merge
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
back with Franklin or if they wanted to
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
um merge with
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
Newfound so they've got 64
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
students I don't know if you want to
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
treat those differently or um the other
 
01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:13.189 align:start position:0%
treat those differently or um the other
possibility

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
is uh as you know Bridgewater and Hein
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
want to pull out of
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
Newfound so if they do that and they set
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
up for one or two years their own SAU
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
and then they merge with another one do
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
you want to have any um special language
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
for those situations there there's talk
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
about merging throughout this state
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's talk about withdrawal throughout
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
this state um it's been discussed in my
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
community havil Co-op wants a pull out
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
of sa23 they think they're going to save
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
money um it's Warren wants to pull out
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
of sa23 and go with Plymouth you got all
 
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
this stuff going on and so I think these
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
are local decisions I believe this gives
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
the road map for those local decisions
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
to be made and I think that's where it
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
is um we've also put in school building
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
Aid you know building Aid grants are
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
looked at in terms of consolidation
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency of scale and all that if
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
you're consolidating yes we're willing
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
to go that direction but we don't want
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
expand um
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
so is there any more discussion on this
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
because we got a break and have a caucus
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
here we have two bills which I think
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
think we have some direction represent
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
Bon it's just a technical suggestion um
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
the the point of reference that you made
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
to 194 C5 I'm just C curious why you we
 
01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just um reference
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
194 uh C4 which actually describes the
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
duties as there a reason I 195 C5 refers
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
back to 190c C4 it does I'm just curious
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know we we have another bill
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in this legislative body where
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
they're looking at Rec codifying all the
 
01:11:07.239 --> 01:11:08.390 align:start position:0%
they're looking at Rec codifying all the
education

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
statutes and you know and it's because
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
we have done this we we've referenced
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
all this stuff we have so many links and
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
and entanglements it's it's just a mess
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
and you know how we ever are going to
 
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.189 align:start position:0%
and you know how we ever are going to
correct

01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't know but uh so I'd like to
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
try to do this the simplest way we can
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
do it and and and get get us on the road
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
to supporting these these school
 
01:11:37.229 --> 01:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
districts so let's take a caucus right
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
now for a few moments
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
and these two bills yes because these
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
are the SAU bills uh do we have another
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
SAU bill I don't think so represent
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
spills spr your bill was what a co-op
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
Co-op co-ops yeah I thought so okay so
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
let's take a few moments here go discuss
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
this um if we're going to be wanting to
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
make amendments then we want to get
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
through the caucuses really quickly here
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
so we can get these amendments made and
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully get them done over the Lunch
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
Period so we can come back and and have

get but that's just a
 
01:43:22.119 --> 01:43:25.870 align:start position:0%
get but that's just a
verb

01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
cons that's that's fine that that's
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
right say that's a verb
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
correct okay uh
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%

apportionment methods for school
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
administrative unit costs when we
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
discussed out there a second ago there's
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
a little confusion we're all on the same
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
page what we need to do is break that
 
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
sentence out on lines three through five
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
into two sentences
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
and the first sentence would read
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
something to this effect in addition to
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
the method of apportionment set forth in
 
01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph one school administrative unit
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
board may consider other methods
 
01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
period Then the method of apportionment
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be used shall and then we go on you
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
know have been approved by the
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
constituent districts pursuant
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
to so they can look at all these
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
different areas they want to look at but
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
what they do is has to be done in
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
conjunct they have to be approved by the
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
constituent districts using the past
 
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
approved so is there any
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
any oh two sentences there be two
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
sentences the uh the method of
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
apportionment to be used shall
 
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
have been approved by the constituent
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
school districts pursuant to RSA
 
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.790 align:start position:0%
school districts pursuant to RSA
194c

01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
2 is that
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
it oh come on now I got it the method of
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
the deportment to be used shall have
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
been shall have been approved by the
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
constituent stool
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
districts and then we have to say
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
something more U to pursuant to the RSA
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's there yeah and it's a it's it's
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
shall in the second sentence they have
 
01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
to do what y we're all good with that we
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
can go ahead and then because we do want
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
to get you know the next discussion by
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
12 o'clock I'm just wondering if the
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
word all be in that second sentence by
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.149 align:start position:0%
 
district

01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
it it can but I think that's specified
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
in 194c
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
to yeah yeah yeah I think we're good
 
01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.109 align:start position:0%
to yeah yeah yeah I think we're good
with

01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
it that's all in there
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
yeah Al righty so what I'd like to do
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
now is uh represent spilsbury's been
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
here waiting all day to talk about his
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
bill and I know folks have to be out of
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
here by 12 so I'd like to offer you that
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try to give us some
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
rationale behind why this
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
bill and why you've done some of the
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
things within it we'll get that I'll
 
01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
have to get to the the page number here
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
with that bill it's uh
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
16 is that 1642 whichever one you want
 
01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
to take up first I'm the I'm the
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of 1383 and the prime sponsor
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
on 1481 1483 in
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
I can take them in the order that you
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
have them listed here and be very
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
brief okay so you're the Prime on 1481
 
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay and 1383 are you a co-sponsor
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
in that one co-sponsor yeah well let's
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
start right and work down through them
 
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.709 align:start position:0%
start right and work down through them
okay

01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
1383 okay 1383 a quick background I had
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
put in and LSR request today after uh
 
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative culcom uh we both wanted
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
to address the question of a Cooperative
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
School District with multiple
 
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
pre-existing districts where there are
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
board seats assigned to a specific
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
District but the member seated for that
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh Town seat gets elected at
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
large that's what lines um 15 through 18
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
do it was my impression at your hearing
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
that there are other elements of
 
01:47:58.189 --> 01:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
Representative cul's
 
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill that raised extraneous questions
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
for example on line
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
nine uh this bill
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
deletes the uh alternative of having all
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
members elected at
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
large and that wasn't uh something I was
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
pursuing uh also down towards the bottom
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
in line 26
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cam's bill would
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
change from a nonpartisan ballot to
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
official ballot under RSA 671 that again
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
was not my agenda and so in assessing
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
the tone of the hearing representative
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
culcom and I have collaborated I spoke
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
to her as recently as yesterday she's at
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
another committee this morning and I
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
have uh I mentioned this to uh chairman
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
lad on Monday I have asked OSS to revise
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh to to give me an amendment which has
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
not been turned out of O us yet as of
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
this moment uh that would simply make
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the change in 15 to
 
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
18 so in other words where you have a
 
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
board seat designated for a pre-existing
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
District only the voters residing in
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
that town could vote for their own
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative and I'd like to just give
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
you an illustration of how this plays
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
out in Fall Mountain we have charl town
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
with about 45% of the students uh
 
01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
Walpole with about 32% of the students
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
alad uh around 18 uh and uh two very
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
small towns aworth and Langdon that are
 
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
about seven or
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
8% we have had two times in the last
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
four years where a charl town contested
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
seat went to candidate a amongst
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
Charlestown voters but then the other
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
towns which collectively have 55% of the
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
vote choose candidate B that's a bad
 
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
result and it leaves Charlestown feeling
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
like their choice didn't Prevail but I I
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
feel just as strongly and sympathetic
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
towards the small towns why should
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
Charlestown with a population of
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
4,800 be able to overwhelm and dictate
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
to aworth within population of 800 who
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
their representative is so I don't think
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
this is something that plays in the
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
hands of a large Town versus a small
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
town I think it's just as important for
 
01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
the small towns which are not in my
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
district um I feel I feel it treats them
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
both the same way so very simple
 
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
proposition if the amendment helps you
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
clear away the other issues in this bill
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
I just wanted you to have an alternative
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
that goes straight to the heart of that
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
one issue are there any questions
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
of represent spillsbury
 
01:50:58.830 --> 01:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
does this get rid of at
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
large so the bill you have in front of
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
you gets rid of at large the amendment
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
I've asked to prepare does not go to
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
that and you know we can prepare another
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
amendment if that's something you do
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to include I just wanted to make
 
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.950 --> 01:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
alternative yes representative
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
leus so when you said it doesn't get rid
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
of that did you change the word from
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
May so so the way the way that the law
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
currently did you put an or in there
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
it's a list of options and there's an or
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of each one there wasn't to
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
begin with that's what I ask and I would
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
say that my Amendment
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
also in line 6 to8 the law currently
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
says shall be limited to the
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
Alternatives contained herein
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
and representative cul's Bill changes
 
01:51:59.310 --> 01:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
that to by the following requirements I
 
01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.189 align:start position:0%
that to by the following requirements I
think

01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's an error and so my Amendment
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
reinstates the language Alternatives
 
01:52:10.109 --> 01:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
contained here in it's intended to be an
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
election thank you how do you deal with
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
a situation where you're let's say you
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
have a a board of seven people from
 
01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.310 align:start position:0%
have a a board of seven people from
various

01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
various
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
districts six are taken up maybe it's a
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
four uh
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
two and this other one you only have two
 
01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.069 align:start position:0%
two and this other one you only have two
districts

01:52:29.069 --> 01:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:52:29.079 --> 01:52:30.669 align:start position:0%
districts
there

01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
is how are you going to sign that out is
 
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
that going to be at large voted by both
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
or or even as a Third District uh I'm
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about one man the law allows
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
for an for a a mix of town specific
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
seats and at large seats and that's the
 
01:52:48.189 --> 01:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
way it's handled for example in in our
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
district where each of the five towns
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of their size has only one
 
01:52:55.069 --> 01:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
rep assigned to them and then there are
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
two out llarge seats and that's where
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
the balance gets adjusted does that
 
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
address your question so the atlarge
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
seat is always going to be a
 
01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.870 align:start position:0%
seat is always going to be a
districtwide

01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
districtwide
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
election and and by the way just to give
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
you an analogy today if there is a
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
warant article to withdraw a certain
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
quantity funds from existing Capital
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
reserves it's set up in our district
 
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
where only the residents of that town
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
get to vote on the expenditure in that
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
town so there's already a mechanism for
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
separating out Town
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
interests yeah those Capital costs are
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
often times on a different formula than
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
than the other we've been talking about
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
right here
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
luno thank you Mr chair but but um but
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
but as far as other Financial interests
 
01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
like the budget that gets voted on at
 
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
the co Co-op district meeting and
 
01:53:58.109 --> 01:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
residents of all the towns that that
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
comprise that Co-op can go to that
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and vote on the the budget orb
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
if they're they're an SP2 um exactly
 
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
correct which occurred yesterday yes
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
right right so everybody gets a a one
 
01:54:14.830 --> 01:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
person one vote uh you know type of type
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:54:21.790 --> 01:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
um ability to approve a um uh or vote on
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
a budget vote on a budget but but but in
 
01:54:29.069 --> 01:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
this case when it comes to the the
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
town um the the the the person from from
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
each of the towns who who may be on the
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
co-op board and this is
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
um uh on on the uh the Roman C I'm
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the law the um the bill is as
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
initially um introduced in Roman 3 so so
 
01:55:00.669 --> 01:55:00.679 align:start position:0%
where you're where you're suggesting
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
that that only the voters in the
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
town so Roman Roman 1 addresses at large
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
um situation R Roman 3 is specifically
 
01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
addressing a
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
situation where um members represent a
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
pre-existing District district and so
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
all this change of language is modifying
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
is in that instance where there is a
 
01:55:32.109 --> 01:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
seat representing a pre-existing
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
district and the change is to take that
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
away from being an atlarge election and
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
make it only the the res and that's my
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
point unlike unlike the the the vote by
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
the by all of the the people who live
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
within the co-op District to vote on on
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
a budget and and and unlike the current
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
law which requires all of the voters all
 
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
the voters who live in the co-op
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
District to vote on all of the
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard members that may be there
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
may be some serving at large there may
 
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
be some serving from each of the member
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
towns of the co-op so all of the members
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
get to vote on all of the Schoolboard
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
members who are now you know would
 
01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
comprise the school board of the
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
district that I live in you'd have in
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
some instances only the member only the
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
voters from each Town voted on the
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
whoever's going to be the representative
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
from their town to the board so a small
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
town with let's say um um let's say a
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
thousand voters um would uh would vote
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
on a member and a larger town with let's
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
say 4,000 voters would vote on their
 
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
their one member so if I'm living in the
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
larger town I don't get as much say on
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
the the the the board uh because my
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
board member is you know was elected
 
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
through by a constituency of 4,000 as
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
opposed elected by a constituency of
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
1,000 and um and that that I think sort
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
of departs from you know if you're a
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
member of a
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
co-op wouldn't wouldn't would you know
 
01:57:14.069 --> 01:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
if I'm living in a co-op wouldn't I be
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
interested in weighing in on all the
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
members who are who are serving on my
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
school board you may have that
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
preference to weigh in and your town
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
might have that preference but that
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
gives the dominant town the opportunity
 
01:57:31.069 --> 01:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
to control the outcomes in all five
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
towns I'm telling you I'm asking for
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
this bill from the perspective of repres
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
of living in the town that's got the
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
largest population but I think it's even
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
more valuable to the little towns that
 
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
my town can
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelm okay F further discussion
 
01:57:49.199 --> 01:57:51.109 align:start position:0%
overwhelm okay F further discussion
represent

01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
cordelli oh yeah I thought you sound I
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
was just going to say our school
 
01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
district is similar and I do represent
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
one of the larger towns and I agree 100%
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
I do not see anything fair about the
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
town of wolfboro determining who
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
effingham's representative is on the
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
school board I think Effingham should
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
determine who they want to represent
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
their town on the school
 
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
board this a smaller town and they
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to elect their board
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
member specifically in addition to the
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
at large members that all of the towns
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
on that that concept is used in some
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
other states and what they do for
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
example across on on the other side of
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
the line with Maine they have a thousand
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
points and then they take and find some
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a ratio so you might have a vote
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
at the outcome of 4.76 for this and 3
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
point something you know other words you
 
01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
you don't get a full member because you
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
only have 40 or 50 kids in your
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
town and so you're given a a voting
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
ratio in accordance with that out of
 
01:59:05.069 --> 01:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
those thousand points and it's it's a
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
convoluted system that's a weighted
 
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
system that's used in some communities
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
some states
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
um if if I can suggest an analogy
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the
 
01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
Congress which is proportional to
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
population and the Senate which
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
guarantees that all states whether small
 
01:59:24.750 --> 01:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
or large have an equal weight of two
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
this is essentially uh you know hybrid
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
where you have five members serving that
 
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
Senate purpose and you have two at large
 
01:59:33.629 --> 01:59:33.639 align:start position:0%
serving that house purpose now how many
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
are at large and how many are by town I
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be a construct of
 
01:59:38.189 --> 01:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
the individual District we're we're
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
going to have to call a break right here
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
because there's some folks have to leave
 
01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:43.719 align:start position:0%
at 12:00 today so we're going to take a

one we have up here is 1383
 
03:14:38.830 --> 03:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
and yeah 1383 do you have an amendment
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:02.429 --> 03:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:05.910 --> 03:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
you okay we have a uh an opportunity to
 
03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
start here in 1383 we have for
 
03:15:10.590 --> 03:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
discussion purposes right now because
 
03:15:12.070 --> 03:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing and I hope we can
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
get this done quickly uh representative
 
03:15:16.990 --> 03:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
SPS spillsbury you're not a member of
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
the committee but this is your amendment
 
03:15:20.429 --> 03:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
of course a Committee Member can
 
03:15:22.830 --> 03:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
introduce that but would you like to
 
03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
just one more time briefly explain the
 
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
changes you have on line 18 and
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
19 thank you very much for giving me the
 
03:15:36.389 --> 03:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity so this essentially undoes
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
the other changes that were proposed in
 
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
1383 they're restor the statutory
 
03:15:45.309 --> 03:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
language is restored so the only change
 
03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at on line 18 and 19 is
 
03:15:51.630 --> 03:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
specifically to provide where there are
 
03:15:55.229 --> 03:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
pre-existing districts assigned a rep to
 
03:15:58.349 --> 03:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
that District it's the res the voters
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
resident in that town that get to vote
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
and those assigned seats by town are not
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
at large this does not change the fact
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
that there can still be at large
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%

03:29:52.429 --> 03:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
on the amendment that was just handed
 
03:29:59.070 --> 03:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:01.510 --> 03:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
it discussion from the maker of the
 
03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you um I I think the
 
03:30:07.870 --> 03:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
important thing that the uh Amendment
 
03:30:13.710 --> 03:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
does um is leave leaves things in place
 
03:30:16.590 --> 03:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
except for the provision that
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
um Town pre-existing District
 
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives should be elected by
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
people within their own District rather
 
03:30:28.590 --> 03:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
than by everyone in the entire uh
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
Cooperative district and that's been uh
 
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
my main goal also so uh I happy to U
 
03:30:44.910 --> 03:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:44.920 --> 03:31:14.910 align:start position:0%
 
pass

03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:14.920 --> 03:31:43.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:31:43.229 --> 03:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
thanks uh a question to anybody that
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
might be bble to answer it um if um if a
 
03:31:52.710 --> 03:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
district is currently um operating under
 
03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 the the the paragraph that's
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
being amended
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
would would their method of voting
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
change uh with the enacting of this um
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know with this becoming law or would
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
it have to go back to the um the co-op
 
03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
or the members for a three-fifths vote
 
03:32:17.790 --> 03:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
to um for the
 
03:32:20.110 --> 03:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
change I I guess is the change
 
03:32:22.790 --> 03:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
retroactive or is it
 
03:32:26.309 --> 03:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
prospective I I would think that it's
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
prospective so it's prospective meaning
 
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
they would have to vote by three fifths
 
03:32:32.910 --> 03:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
to adopt
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:48.640 --> 03:32:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
think

03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:32:52.110 --> 03:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
there's no I mean I thought
 
03:32:54.670 --> 03:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli said yes it's
 
03:32:56.950 --> 03:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
prospective right with the next election
 
03:33:02.349 --> 03:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
what no because what the way the reason
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
so these these
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
options are options that
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
are that are put in the Articles of
 
03:33:14.760 --> 03:33:16.550 align:start position:0%
are that are put in the Articles of
agreement

03:33:16.550 --> 03:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:33:18.510 --> 03:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
in the co-op articles agreement so they
 
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
were if if Roman 4 was incorporated into
 
03:33:25.630 --> 03:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
the article agreement for all existing
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement that use Roman 4
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
it would be referring to the existing
 
03:33:32.830 --> 03:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
language not the language that's
 
03:33:36.590 --> 03:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
proposed to change so
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
so if if if this amendment were to pass
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
and the bill were to pass and become law
 
03:33:47.229 --> 03:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
would would the articles of agreement
 
03:33:50.110 --> 03:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
refer to the old language or would they
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
automatically change right away to the
 
03:33:53.399 --> 03:33:55.950 align:start position:0%
automatically change right away to the
new

03:33:55.950 --> 03:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.070 --> 03:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
language I would think that the if the
 
03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
way it reads right now of course you
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
might have somebody that's domiciled in
 
03:34:05.710 --> 03:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
your particular District that's been
 
03:34:08.349 --> 03:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
elected by way of at large
 
03:34:11.950 --> 03:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
vote this would changes so that the who
 
03:34:15.750 --> 03:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
shall be elected by their own District
 
03:34:18.269 --> 03:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
so yes I think it's I think it's fair
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
that there be a person elected from that
 
03:34:23.950 --> 03:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
particular District that's housed down
 
03:34:25.630 --> 03:34:25.640 align:start position:0%
no that that's not that's not what my
 
03:34:28.950 --> 03:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
question is Mr chair so so look on line
 
03:34:32.070 --> 03:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
six of the of of the amendment it's it's
 
03:34:35.309 --> 03:34:35.319 align:start position:0%
part of current law um that such bylaws
 
03:34:36.950 --> 03:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
and articles of agreement shall be
 
03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
limited to the Alternatives contained
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
herein where applicable so that's Romans
 
03:34:43.790 --> 03:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
Roman 1 2 3
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
4 five
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
well six and seven but if if um if the
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
Articles of Incorporation
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
currently call out Roman
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
4 then does it do the do the terms of
 
03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
the Articles of Incorporation change by
 
03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
the law changing or do they have to make
 
03:35:07.830 --> 03:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
an affirmative decision to change it to
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
update it to the new law I would say
 
03:35:13.229 --> 03:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do anything seeing
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
that you look at item number five Roman
 
03:35:15.399 --> 03:35:16.269 align:start position:0%
that you look at item number five Roman
five

03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
so long as you're following one man one
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know vote you're good yeah but they
 
03:35:23.469 --> 03:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
this this no this clearly doesn't do one
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
man one vote this is very different than
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
that but but we we talked this morning
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
about retroactive laws versus
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
prospective laws and um and for it to be
 
03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
retroactive that's that's some I mean
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
that was something in our conversation
 
03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:41.070 align:start position:0%
that was something in our conversation
this

03:35:41.070 --> 03:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:35:41.080 --> 03:35:43.870 align:start position:0%
this
morning

03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
03:35:49.349 --> 03:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
this set of
 
03:35:52.670 --> 03:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
options excuse me I was going to comment
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
to your comment your question this set
 
03:35:56.319 --> 03:35:57.990 align:start position:0%
to your comment your question this set
of

03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
options will become current law but
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is no way that this set of options
 
03:36:08.349 --> 03:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
will change anybody
 
03:36:08.359 --> 03:36:10.429 align:start position:0%
will change anybody
else's

03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
else's
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
current um
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
bylaws unless they unless is so voted
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
03:36:21.630 --> 03:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
6719 so all this is doing is giving
 
03:36:24.389 --> 03:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
another option that if they want to
 
03:36:26.750 --> 03:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
change it they may change it but it
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't Force anybody to change to
 
03:36:33.870 --> 03:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
that that would be my understanding as
 
03:36:38.990 --> 03:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you so
 
03:36:44.830 --> 03:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
therefore if what representative leus
 
03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
has just
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
indicated is what's
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
meant and please correct me if I'm
 
03:36:55.189 --> 03:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
wrong this bill only accomplishes what
 
03:36:58.189 --> 03:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is trying to accomplish if
 
03:37:03.429 --> 03:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.520 --> 03:37:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
read

03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to respond briefly
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
two ways the
 
03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
intention is that this changes the terms
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the fourth option so that any
 
03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
Town automatically as a result of this
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that currently elects by
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
prior District has to now vote in this
 
03:37:50.030 --> 03:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
way does not require local vote go back
 
03:37:52.990 --> 03:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
to line
 
03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:54.550 align:start position:0%
to line
um

03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:57.070 --> 03:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
seven and you'll see there's a semicolon
 
03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
in the middle of that
 
03:38:02.349 --> 03:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
line so this is saying the number

03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
Proviso thank you Mr chair this
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
situation we're talking about here is
 
03:38:46.110 --> 03:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what my Cooperative district is
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
we have something like eight eight
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
members of the school board and there's
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
one person from each of the eight towns
 
03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
so right now yesterday when I went into
 
03:39:05.110 --> 03:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
the ballot Booth I had eight boxes eight
 
03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
situations and that where I could vote
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
and my town and every other
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
one so person I would I would like to
 
03:39:19.189 --> 03:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
see our district switch to what this
 
03:39:23.070 --> 03:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
amendment does but I don't want to take
 
03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
away the option for another dist
 
03:39:28.349 --> 03:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
District like this or maybe the majority
 
03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
of people in my district like it the way
 
03:39:34.469 --> 03:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
it is I'm wondering if what we need is
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
just add another number in here leave
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
leave four the way it is and add a new
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:44.319 --> 03:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
I I agree with representative fellows
 
03:39:51.630 --> 03:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
that uh what this does is it uh changes
 
03:39:54.670 --> 03:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
option four it doesn't leave option four
 
03:39:57.070 --> 03:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
as an option as it currently exists it
 
03:39:59.950 --> 03:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
changes it and my question would be if
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
you are currently operating under the
 
03:40:04.590 --> 03:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
present form of option
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
4 and it changes to something different
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
and your articles of agreement site
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
option four as it presently
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
exists do you then are you then left
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
without a method of voting and you have
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
to choose one of the
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
current options four
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
options five well there's there there's
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
five as well
 
03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:29.349 align:start position:0%
five as well
but

03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.189 --> 03:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
they I'm just going to pick up when you
 
03:40:37.630 --> 03:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
say that's kind of like or anything else
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
that's mutually agreeable kind of that
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
like we do in some in other cases so
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's your bigger option I just want to
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
bring us to six7 1 colon 9 which is
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
referenced up here it's just one
 
03:40:51.389 --> 03:40:51.399 align:start position:0%
sentence any Cooperative School District
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
organized under any of the provisions of
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 195 that's what we're talking about
 
03:40:58.910 --> 03:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
or pursuant to any special act which
 
03:41:01.349 --> 03:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
also we're talking about May at any
 
03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
regular or special meeting vote to
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
change the number composition method of
 
03:41:09.070 --> 03:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
selection and terms of office of members
 
03:41:11.429 --> 03:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
of board of the district in accordance
 
03:41:13.590 --> 03:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
with the provisions of
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
195 19
 
03:41:19.389 --> 03:41:19.399 align:start position:0%
so it can take it we can as soon as this
 
03:41:21.670 --> 03:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
takes place people can change things if
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
they want to so and I think all of them
 
03:41:25.149 --> 03:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
are covered because I think we have
 
03:41:28.590 --> 03:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
Roman numer five is that catch all yeah
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
so represent Hall thank you I yeah I
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
agree with this thinking down here you
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
haven't given I know representative Le
 
03:41:39.389 --> 03:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
she said this gives us another option it
 
03:41:41.149 --> 03:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us another option gives us
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
an alternative option so to give us
 
03:41:45.630 --> 03:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
another option you would add one more
 
03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral you would keep four and
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
then add one that says with this new
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
language says in the
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:02.189 --> 03:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
you so I'm I'm not clear on how my town
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
if they decide or um Cooperative decided
 
03:42:07.630 --> 03:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to keep it the way it is
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
now for four how that goes forward
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
because specifically in five it says one
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
man one vote I get I get to vote eight
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
times so because I'm voting in the the
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
whole for every single town that doesn't
 
03:42:30.030 --> 03:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
vat yes everybody position the same as
 
03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
reps when you have five reps in the town
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
you get five VES no it it's I there are
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
five reps one in each of well in my case
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
eight towns and I get to vote for the
 
03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
Reps in my town and also every single
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
other Town that's what happens right now
 
03:42:57.510 --> 03:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't see how we are keeping that
 
03:43:00.269 --> 03:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
also um there is a grandfather provision
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
on line 8 but my Co-op was formed after
 
03:43:03.199 --> 03:43:05.229 align:start position:0%
on line 8 but my Co-op was formed after
that

03:43:05.229 --> 03:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:07.710 --> 03:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
time further
 
03:43:12.510 --> 03:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
discussion yes um I I I I hate to extend
 
03:43:15.309 --> 03:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
the you know suggest extending this um
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
executive session I know there we're
 
03:43:18.910 --> 03:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
going to have more bills to do but but
 
03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps um a new version of this
 
03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that restores Roman four to
 
03:43:26.349 --> 03:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
the way it is adds a
 
03:43:28.990 --> 03:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
Roman well they already got a five why
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't we call it a Roman 8 that that has
 
03:43:35.189 --> 03:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
this language um in
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
it and then it's then it's really clear
 
03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
that that um that that co-ops can choose
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
the option that they want and this would
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
then become new option as opposed to
 
03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
something that would necessarily be
 
03:43:51.950 --> 03:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
applied retroactively which you know
 
03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
some districts may have selected Roman 4
 
03:43:57.630 --> 03:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
as it exists now and not wanted to
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
select Roman 4 as it's being you know
 
03:44:03.870 --> 03:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
suggested to be amended so uh because it
 
03:44:05.229 --> 03:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
does change
 
03:44:09.149 --> 03:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
it so maybe an maybe an amendment um as
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows was
 
03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:13.389 align:start position:0%
representative fellows was
suggesting

03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
discussion me yes this is your meeting
 
03:44:18.309 --> 03:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to go back and sit in my
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
chair but I just want to say if you
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
decide that you want to have both
 
03:44:25.469 --> 03:44:25.479 align:start position:0%
options I defer to your judgment but as
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
a matter of statutory or you know
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor intent the intention was to
 
03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
preclude for the way it's written and
 
03:44:36.189 --> 03:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
say if this is what you're going to do
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
have seats assigned to a town then you
 
03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
need to let that town decide that's my
 
03:44:44.110 --> 03:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
intent if you take it you know then I
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
suspect what will happen happen is my
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
district will stay the way it is forever
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
and my effort to try and um reform it
 
03:44:56.910 --> 03:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
will have probably failed as a practical
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
matter but I I appreciate the you know
 
03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
the depth of discussion what we had put
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
in the amendment several years ago
 
03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary transitional plan to move
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
that was required so the end result was
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what SP St has right here but we
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
had a transitional plan in the process
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
to allow to get to that place and for
 
03:45:26.910 --> 03:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
the co-ops to make that decision um and
 
03:45:28.389 --> 03:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's where we were back then and
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
probably we going down a similar path
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
Poss further discussion on
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
the on the
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
yes yeah his point was the point I was
 
03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
thinking as well is that if we divide
 
03:45:46.990 --> 03:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
that that out we might as well just
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
about not do it
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
because it'll still be the bigger or the
 
03:45:55.590 --> 03:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
conglomeration of school districts or
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
the however it works
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
a a majority of other people will be
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
determining who is in that because they

Damon that um I fear that we may have
 
03:49:13.229 --> 03:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
just lined the pockets of a bunch of
 
03:49:15.550 --> 03:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
lawyers um
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
because I I'm not sure exactly how you
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
get from where districts are now to uh
 
03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
the next step if their option that they

um if they're they might make
 
03:49:36.189 --> 03:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
assumptions they might look at um option
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
five and say that takes care of it um
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%

Miler would you like to speak to your
 
03:51:34.830 --> 03:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I I think uh this has been a
 
03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
good conversation but I think there are
 
03:51:41.229 --> 03:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
some questions about the impact of this
 
03:51:41.239 --> 03:51:42.349 align:start position:0%
some questions about the impact of this
uh

03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
proposal on those that already have
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh using option four and I think it'd be
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
a good time to have a chance to get clar
 
03:51:53.790 --> 03:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
clarity exactly what happens when you
 
03:51:57.149 --> 03:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
change a state law as it relates to its
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
impact upon articles of the Articles of
 
03:52:03.189 --> 03:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh incorporation of uh uh Co-op so
 
03:52:05.790 --> 03:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm suppose recommending an
 
03:52:05.800 --> 03:52:06.950 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm suppose recommending an
interim

03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
interim
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
study further discussion from the second
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chair yeah and I I
 
03:52:15.469 --> 03:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
just you know we we have I appreciate
 
03:52:18.269 --> 03:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
represent spillsbury being with us for
 
03:52:21.309 --> 03:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
much of this day um today and and and
 
03:52:24.750 --> 03:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
his work on this and and honestly I'm
 
03:52:27.630 --> 03:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
not I I'm I I I don't particularly have
 
03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
a position on the content it's it itself
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
but I've got concerns over the
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
retroactive nature that that that may or
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
may not be in play here and the fact
 
03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
that there's no members of any Co-op nor
 
03:52:43.309 --> 03:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
representatives from co-ops nor
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys from co-ops
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
here to see that maybe the first step of
 
03:52:50.269 --> 03:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
of of a significant change to their
 
03:52:52.750 --> 03:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement being um being
 
03:52:54.830 --> 03:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
proposed so that's why I'm thinking
 
03:52:56.830 --> 03:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
too further discussion from the
 
03:53:02.910 --> 03:53:02.920 align:start position:0%

04:13:06.269 --> 04:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
town if we lost a member not through
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we had no control
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
over I would like it to be replaced by
 
04:13:12.189 --> 04:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
somebody in our town because that's the
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%

have spoken if they had disagreed I
 
04:21:28.630 --> 04:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
would think they would have shown up and
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that they didn't show up we
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't wait for votes for any of the our
 
04:21:35.149 --> 04:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
other things or inm study just because

04:34:33.310 --> 04:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
end oh you looking at the new one C5 R
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
to wait a minute wait minute it's wrong
 
04:34:36.799 --> 04:34:40.629 align:start position:0%
to wait a minute wait minute it's wrong
yeah

04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.639 --> 04:34:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
C5 Roman to where did I put that well no
 
04:34:47.109 --> 04:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
no looking at looking at the amendment
 
04:34:47.119 --> 04:34:47.830 align:start position:0%
no looking at looking at the amendment
of

04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
1579 yeah
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
there I don't think
 
04:35:03.789 --> 04:35:03.799 align:start position:0%
so C5 Roman 2 talks about everybody
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent shall have only one
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent and personnel respons
 
04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for superintendent duties
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
person or no but but the or so you can
 
04:35:19.949 --> 04:35:19.959 align:start position:0%
either have one superintendent or
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
everybody except a
 
04:35:26.189 --> 04:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
superintendent 194
 
04:35:29.310 --> 04:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
c52 talks about everybody other than the
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent performing superintendent
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
duties so you can either have a
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
superintendent do everything or you can
 
04:35:40.830 --> 04:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
have well any any uh Personnel that you
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
want to employ no but no but right that
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
says or not and right that's right as in
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
your so you can either do this or that
 
04:35:54.029 --> 04:35:54.039 align:start position:0%
so you either have superintendent or you
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
have everybody except a superintendent
 
04:35:58.709 --> 04:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
or people do
 
04:36:00.910 --> 04:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
right well like our school district has
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
a superintendent and a school business
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
office yeah you still can do that yep
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm just so how does the or
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
make that work because you don't need a
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent you could have person
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
do superintendent
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
Services yes but we want only one
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent super and you don't need
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
as in current statute you don't need a
 
04:36:24.429 --> 04:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent as long as someone's ass
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
no I I understand that but what if you
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
have a superintendent and a school

very much everybody Mr chair could I
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
just ask a question um because and I
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
think it's wonderful this the $200
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
incentive got into this um because of
 
04:43:03.910 --> 04:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
that it can't go to fiscal of Finance
 
04:43:05.470 --> 04:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
because it's already passed so it goes
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
right to the Senate I think so I would
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
think so if it passes on the floor yeah
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
yeah and congratulations I think we need
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
that incentive to get School District a
 
04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
great idea now for everybody here that
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
leaves 13 bills left to exact by this uh
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
committee this year and that are house
 
04:43:27.510 --> 04:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
bills yeah and so we'll pick those up on
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
Monday and you'll also notice that on
 
04:43:34.070 --> 04:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
Monday we do have a uh a hearing
 
04:43:36.430 --> 04:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
starting at 9 o' that's for the non-
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:42.910 --> 04:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
1450 so then we have 13 bills following
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
to exec if we don't get them done they
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
will carry forward to the next day which
 
04:43:49.470 --> 04:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
is Tuesday the
 
04:43:52.110 --> 04:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
19th and we have nothing at this point
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
in time scheduled for the 20th
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
unless we can't get things done on 19th
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
we will get things done we're going to
 
04:44:01.470 --> 04:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
get them done we will get things
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
done so um I guess that's it for today I
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
want to thank everybody for hanging in
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
