00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
uh however we have to have it out to
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
date we have to have it out today
 
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
and we have to make a decision today so
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
we will be cutting into our hearing
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
process when we get a short break
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere and looking at that bill
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
in the interim I've been asked that
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
everybody look at SB 140 which is a bill
 
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
which is in the Senate dealing with
 
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
recruitment of teachers
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
and that is a bipartisan bill
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh is something that could you
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
know come to us and we could build upon
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about that
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that that's that's
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
what's happened here
 
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's life
 
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you Mr uh chair I I was
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
scheduled to meet with uh Mr Appleby on
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
Friday to kind of redo it and to do with
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
the bill what we were talking about so I
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
will be moving to retain that bill uh
 
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.019 align:start position:0%
when we get into executive session
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
and we've had quite a discussion on the
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
build even when it was introduced
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
regarding you know the criteria which
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
would qualify somebody for this uh the
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
payment plan how would the payment plan
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
looked like it would be an annual Affair
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
or would it be a sum total at the end or
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
however you want to do it so there there
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
is work that has to be done on this bill
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
but we do have a like bill on the other
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
side of the wall and we oftentimes do
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
this so that's something we will discuss
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
so right now we have uh in front of us
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
well one other Bill be looking at
 
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
um we have had some discussion regarding
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
the mental health instruction mental
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
health in in the classroom and all I'd
 
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.180 align:start position:0%
also ask you to look at SB
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
157 mental health education that's being
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
heard that's over in the uh Senate
 
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.009 align:start position:0%
heard that's over in the uh Senate
education

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
it has bipartisan support 13 Senators
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
have signed on to that particular bill
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
so it's something that we may want to
 
00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:41.779 align:start position:0%
look at as well
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
rather than having to go through and
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
modify something we have we may wait for
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
that that Senate bill that's just
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
something I would like you to look at so
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we you're all aware so two bills to
 
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:53.459 align:start position:0%
look at SB 140 that's the recruitment of
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
teachers in the Senate and SB 157 mental
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
health education in this that's also in
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay going on today with HB 553 relative
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.170 align:start position:0%
School District information on Personnel
salaries

00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:17.339 align:start position:0%
so representative Belcher would you
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
you look much like representative
 
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:41.269 align:start position:0%
you look much like representative
cordelli

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%

relative to school district information

there's no questions from the committee
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
which we have here and we have Barrett
 
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
Christina of the school boards
 
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:23.230 align:start position:0%
Christina of the school boards
Association

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad good morning
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bear Christina
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
from the school boards Association we
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
are opposed to the bill
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
um without getting to hear sort of the
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
the purpose of why this bill is being
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
introduced I'm going to just presume
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
that it relates to more openness and
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
transparency that's certainly a good
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
thing on hsba certainly does not oppose
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
our public bodies being more open and
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
transparent the challenge with the bill
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I am not sure what they mean by all
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
position names and their annual salary
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
or hourly salary position names could be
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
let's just say your first grade teachers
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
but you may have five first grade
 
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.670 align:start position:0%
but you may have five first grade
teachers

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
within a particular building each making
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
a different salary so the position names
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
if you're just saying first grade
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
teacher second grade teacher third grade
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
teacher you don't tie a salary to that
 
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:15.980 align:start position:0%
position you tie a salary to a person
 
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
the second aspect is that um the the
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
Public Employee Labor Relations Board
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
the pelrb the agency that hears disputes
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
between public employers and public
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
employees by law they're required to
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
post all the collective bargaining
 
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
agreements in the state online I know
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
there's always some lag time but there
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
are hundreds of of bargaining units if
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
not thousands of bargaining units across
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
the state so they have the database if
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
you owe the bank of collective
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements on their statute
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
already and if you call your local
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
school district your superintendent or
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
board chair and say could I see the
 
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement for our
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
teachers or could I see the collective
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement for a pair of
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
professionals it's a public record they
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
they can they can send it out to you
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
um so um the other aspect too relative
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
to this bill we've heard a lot of
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
testimony this year and going back over
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years that we have a
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
lot of Staff in our school districts
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
that are not responsible for providing
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
direct Educational Services to students
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
whether that's excessive Administration
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
excessive paraprofessionals excessive
 
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
administrative assistants things of that
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
nature every time you ask a school
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
district to do something that's sort of
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
ministerial if you will that's
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's time and effort
 
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and you know yes we can find time and
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
effort to do that but you know a bill
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
here and a task there and a task here
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
and a task there that adds up to the
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
point where we have to hire another 0.5
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
FTE or I mean 0.5 you know admin
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
assistant to do these sort of clerical
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
things and administer and ministerial
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
aspects that don't necessarily relate
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
directly to the to the delivery of
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
educational services so for those
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
reasons I need SBA opposes the Bill
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
of school boards represent drying
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh this argument
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
comes up in our town meetings a lot of
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
times because the town employs the uh
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
the town office uh lists the salaries
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
down right down to the part-time police
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
officers and the people that plow the
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
roads but the school district does not
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
list the same way with teacher and
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
salary they refer us to a chart which we
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
you have to find it's cumbersome so if
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
this is public record what's the problem
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
with not just doing it the same way that
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
the town employs sure thank you for the
 
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.030 align:start position:0%
the town employs sure thank you for the
question

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
um representative and that may be a
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
practice in your town I'm not aware of
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
any I don't know the town statute so I
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a law that
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
requires that
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
um public employees their salaries are
 
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
certainly public records I I don't
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
dispute that
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
um but I guess the other aspect would be
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
how often does this have to be updated I
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
would imagine in a school district like
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester you have paraprofessionals
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
coming and going all the time small
 
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
school districts you could probably do
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
it you don't have the the staff turnover
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
um but um you know larger districts when
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
you've got people coming and going
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
coming and going you have to update it
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know every year and so you know
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
could it be done possibly but then again
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
don't get frustrated with school boards
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
when you have to hire another 0.5 admin
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
to deal with sort of the the ministerial
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
work that would go behind it so like I
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
said in terms of the transparency we
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't oppose that aspect that's fine
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's just one more task for school
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
districts to have to comply with that
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
don't relate to the Direct Delivery of
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
educational services to kids
 
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.890 align:start position:0%
educational services to kids
yes

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you um in our town it's just an
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
annual report yeah so is would would
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
there be a problem if it was just like
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
an annual sure thank you for the
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
question um it's a good follow-up um no
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think there necessarily would be
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess one challenge is I don't know
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
how many Town employees you have I would
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
imagine your school district has
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
probably five times that I I'm just your
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
town your school is usually the biggest
 
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
employer in town generally depending on
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
on where you live
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but yeah it's sort of an annual
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
report I I think you know that would I
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
that would be more reasonable than it
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
being online and somebody having to
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
update it every time a new staff member
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
came on thank you thank you further
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
represent board
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
isn't at least possibly beneficial to
 
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:43.940 align:start position:0%
have this information out in the public
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
I speak in this regard as someone who
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
has defended the teachers as a union
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
president and
 
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
found that many people
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
make false comparisons such as teachers
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
only teach nine months out of the year
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
and act like they have the summer to fly
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
on the beach
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
and so this is a way of bringing forth
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
and reminding people that this person is
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
putting in a very full week yep and that
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
in fact if we want to retain them we
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
have to let them know that there's a
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
town next door or Upstate somewhere who
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
will hire them away because they're very
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
good and then part of what we have to do
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
is reminding the public yes there is a
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
cost to education okay thank you for the
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
question that that's a that's a great
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
take on it representative sort of
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
turning some of the arguments around if
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean that's certainly a
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
plausible reason for doing it and again
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
the transparency and openness we fully
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
support that but sort of the more policy
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
based reasons for why school district
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
will want to do this and show the
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
community that our teachers work hard
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
and the salary is fair but it may not be
 
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
we hear stories all the time that you
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
know Pittsfield was was the minor
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
leagues their teachers would work for
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
two or three years and then they'd come
 
00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
to Concord or Cole Brown and make
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars a year more you
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
hear that story all the time and in many
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
communities so yeah that's a reasonable
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
a reasonable take representative
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question this
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
relates to outside Contracting does this
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
only apply to people who are hired by
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
the school district or maybe people
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
hired by an agency who come in with
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
special ed services or coming to serve
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
lunch they might work for a catering
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
service or whatever would they be
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
required to have their salaries listed
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
as well yeah thank you very much that's
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
a really good question representative um
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
our food service for example our is a
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
third party company that comes in and
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
um many special education therapists
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
like a a speech pathologist may not be
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
an employee of the district but works
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
for a third party vendor that comes in I
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
was interpreting this as meeting only
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
School District employees that's how I
 
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
was interpreting it thank you
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh we have
 
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
a card from um
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
Ryan Hawkins and here New Hampshire I'm
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
not sure I have much more to add than
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
what uh Mr Christina mentioned uh the
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
the one asked the main aspect that I was
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
going to mention was that all of the
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
salary uh and benefit information on uh
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh the members that we represent are all
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
in collective bargaining agreements on
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
the pelrb website it is it is fairly
 
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:39.380 align:start position:0%
reliably uh updated
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
and there is a requirement to you know
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
submit those to the pelrb when they are
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
ratified so uh more I guess for
 
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
informational purposes than anything
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
else I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you very much Mr
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much Mr Hawkins
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
um what type of information
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
um uh related to this might also be
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
available on the department of
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
education's website
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
I believe the department uh all I
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
believe the department also has
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
administrator information like soup for
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
superintendents and I'm not exactly sure
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
all of the positions but I believe that
 
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:21.620 align:start position:0%
those types of positions are available
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
and yep and follow up on that and those
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
would be positions that fall outside of
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement is
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's right all right thank you thank
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
you further questions yes representative
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
just just for just for the record are
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
you opposed to the bill uh I didn't sign
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
either way I was more informational as I
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
said I don't think it's necessary so I
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
guess somewhat opposed to it
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
um other than to say uh you know this is
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
this is public information and so
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh that is already articulated in
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
a in a uh on the in a collective
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement that the community
 
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
votes on every year uh or uh every other
 
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
year and also on the plrb website
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be able to close down right
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
one bill we have to get out this morning
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
technical support to this committee the
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%

history and statement of the concerns

the original concept of the chart of
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
schools first originated in the 1970s by
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts educator by the name of
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
Ray Bud his idea was that groups of
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
teachers could set up contracts or
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
Charters with their local school board
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%

the field of Education Charter Schools
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
were developed as a way to discover new
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%

difference from standard Public Schools
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
as part of the original Law in 1996 a
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
joint legislative oversight committee
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
was established and charged with an
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
annual report and review
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
and send the report to the State Board
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
of Education on Charter School approvals
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
this committee met many times in the
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
early years and delivered annual reports
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
reliably until 2009
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
when the term expired and that included
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
in 2007 a complete review of the New
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charter school program
 
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
and I quote in the recommendations from
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
that 2007 review
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
the state should invest urgently in the
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
necessary administrative capacity to
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
provide meaningful oversight of the
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
charter school program and fulfill
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
there should be a full curriculum study
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
to determine the quality of the
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
curricula in use in charter schools and
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
their alignment with the New Hampshire
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
State Frameworks before reauthorization
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
there should be a school by school
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
review of the quality of classroom
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
instruction and the Assessments in use
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
both formative and summative
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
further the study recommended the
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
implementation of a formal
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
accountability process begun last year
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
so in 2006.
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
should be strengthened so as to develop
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
Clarity and consensus within and between
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
schools regarding the nature of the
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
required accountability plan measurable
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
goals should be developed by the schools
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
and demonstrated in their yearly report
 
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee was reinstated
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
in 2010
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
it has not met for the last six years
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
it had not filed or issued a report as
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
required in statute since 2011.
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
only four reports between 2013 and 2016.
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
charter schools are reviewed yearly for
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
fire safety and audited financially
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
the full review of curriculum staff Etc
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be on a five-year cycle
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
these reviews several in backlogs do a
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
two elapse of a charter school

through an outside vendor
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge that there are many
 
00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:43.460 align:start position:0%
reasons standing committees fail to meet
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
this bill offers changes to help
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
facilitate a new committee composition
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
that will involve the chairs from the
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
House and Senate education committee or
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
their designees
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
in addition it adds a member from the

recommendations for legislation
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
the committee will also be able to
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
receive requests from the state board as
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
listed in 194-b Colon 17.
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
and that reads the State Board shall

Tanner my only question is since no
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
charter schools are here to testify do
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
we have any general idea if they would
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
be supportive of this
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have any information to respond
 
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220 align:start position:0%

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
none of them are here to testify thank
 
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.210 align:start position:0%

introducing that
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I know those weren't your remarks
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
those were prepared by representative
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
Tanner and um and uh I had not read them
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
in advance and I think it um I uh I I I
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
think those remarks contained a good
 
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.270 align:start position:0%
think those remarks contained a good
historical

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
um summary of um of what this oversight
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee has done in Prior years up
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
through 2009 and then I think you might
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
have said 2011 and with with
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out in those
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
annual reports and then not much since
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
since then
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
um so I was the question is I was
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
wondering and maybe a question to the
 
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
chair uh maybe we could get copies of
 
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.510 align:start position:0%
chair uh maybe we could get copies of
those

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
um remarks for um for us because I that
 
00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:43.339 align:start position:0%
this is really the first historical
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
summary that I've
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
heard on charter schools I have
 
00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:51.069 align:start position:0%
heard on charter schools I have
um

00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
those remarks right there could be
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
submitted to the part that you have
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
there and then copies can be made
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
I will do that
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
and then I would also ask beyond that
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
that our committee researcher
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
uh because there I I can State
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
emphatically there are a few holes which
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
have not been mentioned in there and I
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
don't want to go into that right here so
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is have a a real
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
research done by our researcher which I
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
think would be I think it would and
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
really Baseline as as to what what's
 
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
been done over the last couple decades
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you represent dry had her hand up
 
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.390 align:start position:0%
thank you represent dry had her hand up
first

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
may I just add I do also have a chart
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
from representative Tanner that goes
 
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:37.820 align:start position:0%
from 1995 to 2018.
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
documenting the number of meetings per
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
year whether minutes were retained
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and there's only one year here 2011
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
that says yes for a report so this is
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
I'll just add that to what's submitted
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
to the clerk reps and dry thank you
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
filling in uh so I've heard that they
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
haven't done reports in any inkling why
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any meetings or
 
00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:04.250 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any meetings or
reports

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the committee hasn't
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
met so you can't do a report if you
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
haven't done any work okay follow-up
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
question any reason why the committee
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
hasn't met I don't know the specifics
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay so I would agree that we probably
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
need some research and all that for the
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
research represent Belcher
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm not actually sure
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
who I should be directing this to
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
because I have a little bit of confusion
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
on the way OLS put this together
 
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.870 align:start position:0%
on the way OLS put this together
um

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I I just say because at the very end
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
if if you read the way that they usually
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
put things together the only thing
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
bolded in this is the very end of the
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
new language by July 1st of each year
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking at the statute online
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
and it looks like it's a different
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
statue may I answer that yes please so
 
00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:58.940 align:start position:0%
online one and two it says RSA
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
194-b21 is repealed and reenacted so the
 
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
except it turns out that last section
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
that has just the one Bolding is
 
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:22.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
the question would be if I were looking
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
here at B21 it'll having only sections
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
one and two I'm wondering why three four
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
and five are not folded as I would
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it has to do with the first lines
 
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
one and two okay
 
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay I understand now that's thank you
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
just a comment on representative
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
belcher's like this is something that I
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
think it trips people up all the time
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
um and and um and you gotta be
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
when it's repealed and reenacted you
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
have to take all those words as if new
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
um as its new language and it will never
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
be bolded or or stricken out
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the issue no no but I'm just
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
saying I know yeah we we got that it was
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
that was why he was wondering why it was
 
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
bolded if it was all new but it's
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
because starting on line 25 yes it's
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
referring to a different section it's
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
referring to be 17 as opposed to be 21.
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
this and so with the first top the the
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know regular one is new but when you
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
get down to number two that is actually
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
amending a different thing and that was
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
the issue and
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
so in all this this is one of the
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
reasons and new members ought to be
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
aware there's another uh uh type of
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork we can request we call it side
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
by side
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the side by side shows statute as it
 
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
is now and then there's another column
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
which shows as Rewritten
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
and then referencing different statutory
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
language so it's really really clears up
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
we used to get a lot more of our
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
legislation with uh the embold the
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
Bolden uh the language like July 1 here
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
we could quickly see it but then you
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
also miss this other stuff up top which
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
is new
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
and how's that compared to what we have
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
in current law that's what the side by
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
side shows us and that's done by our
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee researcher
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
and later on we will do this often when
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
we look at you know like Community
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
Conference reports or we look at stuff
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's coming in from the Senate to see
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
how that compares
 
00:41:59.290 --> 00:41:59.300 align:start position:0%
it helps us out a great deal so don't be
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
Asheville in the future and asking for a
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
further further questions yes

you have the researcher going to a more
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
historical depth could provide us at
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
education in April of 1999 under the
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
pressure of the New Hampshire state

supreme court a temporary plan to fund
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools was passed by the

825 million dollar funding amount about
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
one half of the funding was new from the
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
hodgepodge of increased taxes and fees
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
and from tobacco settlement money the
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
other half of the plan's Revenue which
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
is the basis for this bill came from a
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax that
 
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
was no more than a renamed portion of
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
the local property tax this tax formula
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
was made permanent in 2002. generally
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
property tax is dealing with funding
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
public education in this state are out
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
of control the state legislative bodies
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
and the governor's office have been
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
trying for over 24 years to put a whale
 
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
into a tub of water
 
01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
on average over the last eight years
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
property taxes have risen by 23 percent
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
the problem concerning the funding of
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
public education is that property owners
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
can no longer sustain these increases
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
where they are now paying over 70
 
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
percent of the cost of public education
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
from their property taxes that are
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
widely disproportionate from town to
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
town we have heard from many in our
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
communities the family Property Owners
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
the small business owners who say they
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
can no longer sustain these constant
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
increases to the cost of local funding
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
for public education this is a big
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
economic issue for the State of New
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the question arises of where
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
do the property owners look for help if
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
eight different governors of New
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 1983 have used state tax
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
revenue money to fight implementation of
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
State funding from local public
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
education another series of lawsuits was
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
filed in July of 2022 by several
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers against the state of New
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alleging that the result in
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
swept violates taxes being Levy at a
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
non-uniform rate
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
this case is Rand versus the state of
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the defense of this case
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire again uses
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
state tax revenue monies and that's in
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
the fiscal report of June 30th 2022
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
Pages 103 I think in 104.
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
since 1983 the elected state
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
representatives and senators of both
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
parties have fought against reform of
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
public education funding in New
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%

from the New Hampshire school funding
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
fairness Project Director quote the
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
property tax is an unfair tax as it
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
places greater responsibility on the low
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
and moderate income taxpayers than it
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
does on more affluent ones
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
and quote despite its heavy Reliance on
 
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
the property tax and in turn that taxes
 
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
heavy toll on the least well-off New
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does little to mitigate the
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
impact of the tax on those struggling to
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
make ends meet approval of this bill
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 649 would address the
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
property tax of swept on the low
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
moderate and affluent Property Owners by
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
not having a state tax on real estate
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
property for public education you would
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
not see swept remittance to the state
 
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
there would be no excess swept collected
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
by various towns there would be no need
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
to set up a total property tax relief
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
program from low to moderate income
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners and with no Statewide

in Mr ardinger's letter to the house

Ways and Means Committee on September 15
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
2021 and before I go any further I do
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
have all this information for the quirk
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh to give to you at the end charts and
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
everything else okay uh he identified
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
the potentially significant
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
constitutional risk arising from the
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
current State education property tax Mr
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
ardinger also supplied a supplemental
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
statement on pages 85 through 93 of the
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
commission study funding released on
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
December 1st 2020. under commission
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
member statements Mr ardinger emphasized
 
01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:14.210 align:start position:0%
member statements Mr ardinger emphasized
that

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
quote in my view public schools are the
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
most important public asset in each of
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
our communities as a result a result
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
that Mr ardinger considered the most
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
important finding was we must fix the
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
current unfair distribution of state aid
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
resources another written comment from
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
Mr ardinger is New Hampshire student
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes are worse for districts with
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
greater student needs the proposed
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
Solution by House Bill 649 is a proper
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
use of legislative power to help the
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
property owners and the students of New
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the framework of this bill is
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
for property tax relief
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
from house Ways and Means Committee
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
report of January 29 2019 representative
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
Gary Merchant of Claremont who is still
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
in the legislature today made a
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
presentation for property tax relief he
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
said many homeowners are retirees who
 
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
have looked forward to staying in their
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
homesteads after paying off their
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
mortgage yet these homeowners struggle
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
to stay in their homes because they can
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
no longer afford to pay property taxes a
 
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
main reason for this challenge is the
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
income of many retirees significantly
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
declines upon retirement and he
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
continued with funding public education
 
01:07:32.809 --> 01:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
as an artifact of colonial times when
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
wealth was predominantly a factor of
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
land Holdings over the past centuries
 
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
wealth has shifted from Real Estate to
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
other forms of assets as equities yet
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
the funding of public education remains
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
based on property values which do not
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
Encompass most wealth in modern America
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
and just recently on February 4th 2023 I
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
received an email from the Reverend J
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
McLeod of Wilmot one of the towns I
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
represent I am writing to you now
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
because I want working-class New
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youngsters to get the quality
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
education that I received a fair and
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
rational system will direct more
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
resources to poor districts in New
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do the opposite he says
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
some poor districts with low property
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
values have to tax their residents at a
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
rate 10 times higher than wealthy towns
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
in order to spend
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
the same per pupil High property taxes
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
in these Town means that people are
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
losing their homes especially the
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
elderly and disabled
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
businesses can't survive in or won't
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
open in towns that need them the most
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
because the property taxes are higher
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
than the wealthy tones
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%

Newport our funding of schools means
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
that the life chances of Newport kids

are much lower than for their New London
 
01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
counterparts and Newport residents have
 
01:09:01.329 --> 01:09:01.339 align:start position:0%
to pay far more in school property taxes
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
residents of poor towns get hit with a
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
double whammy they pay more and receive
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
Less in New Hampshire today education
 
01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:12.249 align:start position:0%
Less in New Hampshire today education
reinforces

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:12.259 align:start position:0%
reinforces
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
inequality close or quote I have
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
prepared exhibit a which
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
Sally would you mind helping
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
there's 10 for this side and 10 for the
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%

excuse me excuse me Representatives all
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
over there oh all right thank you Matt
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
I have prepared
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
exhibit a which shows the members of
 
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
this education committee the dra
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
completed public tax rates
 
01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.209 align:start position:0%
completed public tax rates
for

01:09:55.209 --> 01:09:55.219 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:55.219 --> 01:09:56.810 align:start position:0%
for
2022.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
you will see in the First Column when
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
you eventually get the chart
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for that Mr chairman
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see the total tax rate for
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
your community
 
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
then the second column you'll see the
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
actual local education tax rate of 2022
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the third column you'll see what the
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
swept tax is
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
this tax year and in the fourth column
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
is the doe estimated swept revenue for
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 at a dollar forty four per
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
thousand equalized value that your
 
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
community will have to raise under swept
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
in addition to what the local tax rate
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
will be to meet the schools districts
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
and to figure out the amount of property
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
tax you would save on your home slash
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
land from not having to pay the swept
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
tax multiply the sweat tax times the
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
total assessed value of your home and
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
land and only you know that that is real
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
money that every real estate property
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
owner will save by implementing house
 
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
bill 649.
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
the amount of the swept that you'll see
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
in that third column as shown on this
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
chart for your community may seem to be
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
a small amount but the decrease of the
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
property owner would be an immense
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
reduction in taxes per thousand of
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
assessed value to their property
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
as Reverend McLeod wrote it is a start
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
to equalizing opportunities and allowing
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
all children to reach their potential as
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
state legislatures You Can level the
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
playing field the repeal of the
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax will
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
provide property owners and increase of
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
discretionary income more money in your
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
constituents profits for local spending
 
01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:57.620 align:start position:0%
or for Town needed projects or equipment
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
this reduction in taxes and more money
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
in your constituents Pockets only works
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
if there is no State shifting of this
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
repeal tax
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
onto the local how much more time do you
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
need for that I have just two two pages
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
foreign I would ask for a chance to at
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
least present my other chart
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
if you can pass us out we will be
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
looking at those charts uh okay so
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
there's no need to go through the charts
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
a quick summarization I'll just glance
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
quickly at my notes Here Mr chairman
 
01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.530 align:start position:0%
quickly at my notes Here Mr chairman
um

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted revenue for the general
 
01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:55.580 align:start position:0%
education trust funds over the last
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
since fiscal year 21
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
was 2.9 billion ahead of plan by 323
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
million or 12 percent and fiscal 22
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
3 billion 2.1
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
was ahead of plan by 435 million this is
 
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
a total of 759 million dollars over a
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
two-year fiscal period
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
if you decide to accept the premise and
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
prevent State shifting of this tax
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
revenue to amount to the whole to the
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
local taxpayer
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
the state legislature would have to
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
restructure the budget
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
and remit to the general fund amount of
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars and those charts
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
that are coming around now there's an a
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
which shows in
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
column H how much
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 general fund would have
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
to move over or be taken off
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
to pay for the 363 million dollars
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
that'd be in line h
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
if you were to just do the 263 million
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
which came in this year
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
which has been applied this year
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
from the general fund
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's left over after the
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund has been funded you
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
would have to take an additional online
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
age 13 percent
 
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
from this amount
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
and the last C was If This Were to have
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
gone in effect back in 2018
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
the line H would have showed you to take
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
23 percent of the general fund monies
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
that were left over after they were
 
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.430 align:start position:0%
that were left over after they were
distributed

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:14:57.729 --> 01:14:57.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
in Richter ardinger's view of the
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
September 21st letter to the house ways
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
and means if the current statutes
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
imposing collection or remission of
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
State education property tax effectively
 
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
provide for such differential tax rates
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
on the same class of taxable property
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
than such differential tax rates would
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
likely violate the New Hampshire
 
01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
likely violate the New Hampshire
Constitution

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.010 align:start position:0%
Constitution
um

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman there are times when you
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
must sail Against the Wind of your own
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
political party of gradualism for the
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of many
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
I call these institutional
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
obstacles let us stop kicking this can
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
down the road and making a lasting
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
change on this monetary issue this bill
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
is about fairness and justice for the
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
property owners it is a viable solution
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
to one aspect of public education
 
01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.030 align:start position:0%
to one aspect of public education
funding

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
can this committee deliver for what's in
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the public
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
and as I close I was I did review my
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
chart and in discussion with the dra
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
the applicability date of July 1st 2023
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be open to Amendment because tax
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
bills have already gone out rates have
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
already been set for this uh upcoming
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
year it might be a two-year process
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
before that maybe this bill would come
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
or be to be implemented and um
 
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
this bill is more direct and less
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
complicated than maybe a lot of other
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
Maneuvers or bills that are being
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
presented at the present time thank you
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you are there
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
you very much representative schanberg
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for bringing this forward
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
um just a a question with respect to Mr
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
ardinger's um letter uh is that specific
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 649 or was that for
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
another bill no that was for House Bill
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
504 last year thank you and and um and
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I and I I I've read that letter
 
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
obviously I was connected to House Bill
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
504 and uh and do agree with it
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
um uh and I believe
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
um uh attorney ardinger's
 
01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.090 align:start position:0%
um uh attorney ardinger's
um

01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
basis for that was not so much uh of us
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
against the state property tax as it was
 
01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:36.380 align:start position:0%
against the excess being retained by uh
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and that being considered
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
a rebate or a tax or a reduced unequal
 
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
um disproportional tax rate is that
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
correct you are correct with that but he
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
does mention the disproportionate part
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
of that it is hard to resolve unless you
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
change the swept tax right thank you
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
further questions represent McDonald
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward on Tuesday in his
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
address and otherwise yesterday in his
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
presentation the governor announced
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
significant proposed changes to the
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula and to my understanding
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
he did not plan to change the swap tax
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
in the formula and I realized that you
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
must have submitted this bill prior to
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal but now that
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
that has been released do you see this
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
as going hand in hand with that clashing
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
with that if both of these were to go
 
01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.169 align:start position:0%
with that if both of these were to go
forward

01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
would you mind just repeating the last
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
portion a little bit louder yes as as
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
you get older in life if you don't buy a
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
hearing aids you got to have people
 
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
speak up all right thank you
 
01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:47.900 align:start position:0%
representative would you see your bill
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
649 FN If This Were to pass would it
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
clash with the governor's proposal to
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
change other parts of the adequacy
 
01:18:55.140 --> 01:19:00.950 align:start position:0%
change other parts of the adequacy
formula

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would Clash I think it
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
might even help his approach
 
01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:09.620 align:start position:0%
um after six years
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
this is the first time I've heard a real
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
change in the governor's uh address
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
about local
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
education how to fund it all right thank
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome further questions
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
this question I'm going to refer to your
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh dra completed public tax rates 2022
 
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.450 align:start position:0%
uh dra completed public tax rates 2022
handout

01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
handout
 
01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.350 align:start position:0%
handout
um

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
so the the maximum spread in here
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
appears to be roughly five to six times
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
but if you eliminate the high and low
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
outliers we're looking at more like a
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
two times Gap
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my question would be
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
because the the foundation of your bill
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
is based in fairness
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
um are you suggesting that one town
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
where a property is maybe valued at 250
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
000 versus another District where
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
similar property is very valued at 500
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
000 where they are paying the same
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
amount even though it's not the same
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
rate is would you consider that to be an
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
unfair situation
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
no I don't set the valuations of the
 
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.010 align:start position:0%
no I don't set the valuations of the
towns

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
does that
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a question for the
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
dra maybe to answer
 
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.390 align:start position:0%
dra maybe to answer
um

01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
I just know that the the
 
01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:32.060 align:start position:0%
some towns are more fortunate to have
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
different sources of revenue versus
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.010 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
are there further yes if I was just
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
going to ask the follow-up because I
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
obviously I know you don't set the rates
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
but just as far as the Gap there
 
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
is there is there fundamental unfairness
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
in paying the same amount of money
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
between districts for two similar
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
properties even if they're evaluated say
 
01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.649 --> 01:21:06.659 align:start position:0%
from my my personal opinion might be yes
 
01:21:06.659 --> 01:21:08.330 align:start position:0%
from my my personal opinion might be yes
but

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
I really can't answer that question okay
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
committee represent luno thank you very
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair so um and this sort of
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
follows a representative representative
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
belcher's question uh with respect to
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
fairness and just a couple of you know
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
well I mean I guess one observation
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
would would be um just looking because
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
you've sort of laid out the spreadsheet
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
for each of the towns that we represent
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
and um and in Hopkins and I think we uh
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
we take the prize with them uh total tax
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
rate and um I've never heard I mean I'm
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'm sure our constituents would
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
love to see a tax reduction of a buck 35
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
but I've never heard any of Buddy in
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton say our taxes are great except
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
they're just a dollar 35 too high and
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
what that is is a lead into question why
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
why is this so fair when when um when
 
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers in tuft and Borough
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
essentially get a 13 tax reduction and
 
01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers in Berlin get a 3.4
 
01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
percent tax reduction don't the folks in
 
01:22:23.699 --> 01:22:25.209 align:start position:0%
percent tax reduction don't the folks in
Berlin

01:22:25.209 --> 01:22:25.219 align:start position:0%
Berlin
 
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
need something more
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
they do and I was hoping that
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
you remove the sweat tax and then the
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
education committee comes forth and
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
readjust maybe that the disparity Aid
 
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
the aid of various communities uh from
 
01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:46.340 align:start position:0%
the general
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh fund of the State of New Hampshire uh
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
I am just horrible so that
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
of all the taxes we have which we have
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
16 taxes
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
this is the one tax that goes directly
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
to the property owner it is the one tax
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
that they can say
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
ah this went down how did it go down and
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
then you can say we took the swept tax
 
01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
off the state can better do this and we
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
can find our money elsewhere to take
 
01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:23.659 align:start position:0%
care of your uh disparaging or
 
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
disproportionate amounts that each Town
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
might have tough and Borough to Berlin
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative uh
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:19.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:19.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
thank you uh good morning Mr chairman
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
and committee members

um I'm representative Sally fellows I
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
represent holderness Plymouth and
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%

01:24:37.209 --> 01:24:37.219 align:start position:0%
of Education for 30 years I started in
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
1985 in the very first
 
01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.390 align:start position:0%
1985 in the very first
um

01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
task I had was to write a computer
 
01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
program to allocate what we now call
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid for Governor John H sununu
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
so just to give you some perspective of
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
the history of education funding in New
 
01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since the Claremont decision
 
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
which was in
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
1998 thereabouts there have been many
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
many changes to the formula and many
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
many proposals to the formula so what we
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
are doing right now I think
 
01:25:18.649 --> 01:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
I never EX at first I thought there
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
would be a solution and and one day it
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
would be like oh this is what we're
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
going to have and this is what we'll go
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
forward for it never has lasted for more
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
than a couple of years so it will always
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
be an ongoing problem but I hope we can
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
get to a place where it's really more
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
stable and just needs little tweaks
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
instead of big ones that being said
 
01:25:42.169 --> 01:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
um wanted to give you my perspective on
 
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
that was enacted 20 years ago in
 
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:54.260 align:start position:0%
response to the Claremont lawsuit
 
01:25:57.850 --> 01:25:57.860 align:start position:0%
and what it does what it did at the time
 
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
is it looked at the tax bills that were
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
being paid by property taxpayers and
 
01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
said we're gonna just we're gonna
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
identify a portion of that as a state
 
01:26:16.689 --> 01:26:16.699 align:start position:0%
tax these property taxpayers were
 
01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:19.580 align:start position:0%
they've been paying this tax all along
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
the only thing that has changed is that
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
some of it has been labeled as a state
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
tax I call that smoke and mirrors
 
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
so that being said
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
um what would happen if you did as as
 
01:26:37.729 --> 01:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative Schaumburg told you what
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
would happen if you did eliminate or
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
reduce the Statewide property tax
 
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
um the the tax let's see for for FY
 
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.149 align:start position:0%
um the the tax let's see for for FY
23

01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
property the Statewide property tax was
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
reduced by about a third and
 
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
that caused when you take it out of the
 
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
school funding formula it causes more
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
money to go to the towns
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
um changing making changes to the
 
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax is not a new idea
 
01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:21.500 align:start position:0%
we recently have done that
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that you retain this
 
01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.970 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that you retain this
bill

01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
until you you find out what we end up
 
01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.890 align:start position:0%
until you you find out what we end up
with

01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
um at the in June you know what we vote
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
on end up voting for to have school
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
funding be for the next two years and
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill would give you an
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at you more into the
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
details of that and see how we can you
 
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
know what we might want to do going
 
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
forward from that point
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
and to answer
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
um one question I heard about
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
the comparability of the valuation of
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
the same properties in different
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
communities I think we saw a very good
 
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
example of that during covid
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
when the values in Rockingham County
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
shot up enormously
 
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and in other other counties they all
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
went up but in other counties they went
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
up less and it is absolutely true you
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
just ask any real estate agent you take
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
the same house and you put it in coax
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
County or you put it in Portsmouth and
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
that same house is going to have
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
drastically different valuations
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
so that's something that could be
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
discussed if you retained this bill so
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
I'm just encouraging you to do that
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative fellows
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just just to follow
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
up on what you just said very very true
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
same house in Portsmouth versus kowas
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
County very different valuations but is
 
01:29:10.209 --> 01:29:10.219 align:start position:0%
it your feeling or your testimony that
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
this the resident of that house from one
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
one of those places the other paying the
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
same amount of money despite the rate is
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
well I I don't think it would be I don't
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
think it equalizes itself out
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh for for one thing and be just for for
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
one for example
 
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
um this is personal but the pers the
 
01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
first proposal of the northern pass went
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
not on my land but across what I see
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
when I look out the window in my
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
backyard and to to base attacks on
 
01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
something that can be influenced by
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
um people who want to move to New
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of covid or because
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
the utility comes along and puts puts a
 
01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:04.139 align:start position:0%
you know line behind your house changes
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the value of your house that just seems
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
to me to be very odd
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that helps you out
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
but I think that talking about this
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
um how it works was definitely uh
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
something that is is important to do
 
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where I'm coming from
 
01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I know you I have such a big
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
work Logan thank you for hearing you're
 
01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:30.770 align:start position:0%
work Logan thank you for hearing you're
welcome

01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
like to invite the New Hampshire school
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
on next New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:30:35.159 --> 01:30:41.570 align:start position:0%
on next New Hampshire Municipal
Association

01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
welcome Catherine
 
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd and members of
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
Catherine heck and I represent the New
 
01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association the 234
 
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in New Hampshire and I
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
admit it's rather strange for us to be
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of you today I did fill
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
out a pink card there is no box to check
 
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.330 align:start position:0%
out a pink card there is no box to check
concerns

01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
um so while it is checked as in
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
opposition are are really it's some
 
01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
concerns based on timing I was not privy
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
to the sponsors willingness to consider
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
the effective date so I did just want to
 
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
go through how the current date as
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
written affected July 1st of 2023 could
 
01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
um be somewhat concerning or problematic
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
on the municipal side not the school
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
side we're talking on the municipal side
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
so as you know we the municipality
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
collects all the taxes County local
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
schools City or Municipal tax and
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
Village District if they have it on
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
behalf of the county and the school we
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
retain it it is a formula calculate it
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
on paper and then we give a hundred
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
percent of that obligation on the
 
01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:50.780 align:start position:0%
missile side back to the school district
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
based on what the school board decides
 
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
if the payment schedule so when we look
 
01:31:58.930 --> 01:31:58.940 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note seeing a decrease
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
in Revenue when we set our budgets as
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
you know we're all going through that
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
process right now regardless of whether
 
01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
you're a annual town meeting town or a
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
city all of those budgets will be taking
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
effect in the next several months and
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
that all accounted for the current swept
 
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
formula so when we talk about the
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
reduction that you might see on your tax
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill because we are raising and
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
appropriating and for argument's sake
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
we're just going to use a million
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
dollars the school needs a million
 
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
dollars the municipality has to collect
 
01:32:30.050 --> 01:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
a million dollars so the school can
 
01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.250 align:start position:0%
a million dollars so the school can
operate

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter if it's on the swept
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
side if that's repealed or the local
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
side we're still going to have to raise
 
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
that that million dollars so I don't
 
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
think that's going to change
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
um because we're not here to comment on
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
the policy of swept or on the
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
legislature's decision on how they want
 
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
to administer sweat we're just here to
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
comment on the mechanics of swept in
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
addition we do know that some
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities are able to collect and
 
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
retain maybe more than what the swept
 
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
tax is we recognize that however again
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
their budgets have been determined and
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
set based on these current numbers in
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
the current Formula so again any change
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
to that will be reflected on the local
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
property tax so we just wanted to point
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
that out as you consider and deliberate
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and how the timing of this is
 
01:33:20.649 --> 01:33:20.659 align:start position:0%
really like in 18 months
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
process in order for everybody to be
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
prepared on how this would change the
 
01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
whole tax collection process cash flow
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
for example because swept of course if
 
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
you are in a monthly program for example
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
in a municipalities able to hold those
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
school taxes it collects and pay it over
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
the course of a year that assist the
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
municipality who might experience you
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
know cash flow and then the low and
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
moderate income repeal we do know
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
anecdotally from our welfare offices
 
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
that that is a tool I believe 1.3
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars was allocated last year
 
01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
that is a tool that helps the low and
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
moderate income and that does assist
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's a state program it's still a tax of
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
course but it does not hit the local tax
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
budget when any assistance can come from
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
another source for example so we just
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out and I can
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
certainly take any questions and I thank
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you very much
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
Catherine are there questions from the
 
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.290 align:start position:0%
Catherine are there questions from the
committee

01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock thank you
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning thank you for
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
being here
 
01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:24.649 align:start position:0%
being here
um

01:34:24.649 --> 01:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
unlike representative luno and
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative this this confuses me I'm
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
sure they I'm sure they get it very
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
clearly if this date was rolled out as a
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh Schoenberg had said at
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
a different date for FY 25 or 26 out
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
there what would be your opinion of the
 
01:34:43.679 --> 01:34:44.689 align:start position:0%
there what would be your opinion of the
bill

01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
for impact of the bill so
 
01:34:47.699 --> 01:34:49.250 align:start position:0%
for impact of the bill so
from

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
either the school or the town side if we
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
just want to talk about raising and
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
appropriating taxes whatever the budget
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
is the budget is and the taxpayers pay
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
so it really doesn't matter how we
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
flip-flop it it's just a shift so I
 
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
can't I don't want to speak to a policy
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's the legislature's decision to
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
enact I just want to speak to if it's a
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars a school needs to
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
operate it's a million dollars no matter
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
where that comes from so it's state
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
federal and local taxation so we are
 
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
just flip flipping one for another
 
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
unless there is another formula and that
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
was discussed put in place that
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
redistributes Aid in a different way for
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
example but it it's the dollars that we
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
need so repealing the swept with no
 
01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:37.370 align:start position:0%
need so repealing the swept with no
other

01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
program in place is just shifting it to
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
a fully local tax in my opinion
 
01:35:45.169 --> 01:35:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman thank you
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
very much further further questions from
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
you for your time I appreciate it
 
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have any other pink cards
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
up here are there any other members of
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
the public that want to speak on this
 
01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.270 align:start position:0%
the public that want to speak on this
bill

01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much we
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
will close this hearing on 6 49.
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
ion

01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that's right we've heard this

thank you that's right we've heard this
yeah

01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
so so for those in the public we have
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
all this hearing Was Heard
 
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago so it by accident got
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
into this so when there is no hearing
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
coming up in transportation at this
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
point in time we will be jumping ahead
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
then at uh 11 30 for 5 28 so for the
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee here we have
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
about 45 minutes to
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
no no no no no
 
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.950 align:start position:0%

um we have sponsors see we have
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
so uh as a notice to the Republicans
 
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
here we will have a caucus starting at

that hearing at 11 30. and to discuss
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
some of the bills which we will be

exacting later today 11 o'clock so you
 
02:33:41.330 --> 02:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:33:45.050 --> 02:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I'm uh
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
resident Timothy Horrigan from the town
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
of Stratford uh town of Durham which is
 
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 as probably
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room knows already so
 
02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
and I passed two eyes around actually
 
02:33:58.370 --> 02:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
both of which I emailed to the committee
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't hurt to have the paper
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh as a backup which is uh one is in a
 
02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's like a uh there's an amendment
 
02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
which uh basically corrects an objection
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
that was in the fiscal note so
 
02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:13.370 align:start position:0%
that was in the fiscal note so
apparently

02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
02:34:15.650 --> 02:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
um the body of the bill has introduced
 
02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
which I think was the same problem last
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
time although they did they mention last
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
time is that there's a three cent
 
02:34:24.650 --> 02:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
payment and the 27 Cent payment which it
 
02:34:26.809 --> 02:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
adds up to 30 but apparently it really
 
02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
needs that up to 40. so I changed the 27
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
to 37 and if that's uh
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
and there may be other changes that need
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
to be made to the bill but it leaves it
 
02:34:40.130 --> 02:34:40.140 align:start position:0%
up to you you folks so it's um looks
 
02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
very familiar to those who are on the
 
02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
committee last year virtually identical
 
02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
to HP 1660 which actually came within a
 
02:34:48.349 --> 02:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
few votes of passing the pick difference
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
is the effective date of course
 
02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
and this time around the code size with
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of a biennial budget cycle
 
02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:56.030 align:start position:0%
the beginning of a biennial budget cycle
um

02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
and uh so it makes two changes the RSA
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
189 level 29 11a which deals with fruit
 
02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
and nutrition programs the first thing
 
02:35:06.050 --> 02:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
in section one this would be a permanent
 
02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
change would be to require schools for
 
02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
my breakfast in addition to lunch
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
the second change is is uh shown in
 
02:35:15.530 --> 02:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
section two to four of the bill and this
 
02:35:18.650 --> 02:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
would apply only to July 1st 2025 which
 
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
is a little over two years from now and
 
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
of course uh
 
02:35:25.010 --> 02:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
that's the opinion of the state's fiscal
 
02:35:27.530 --> 02:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
year 2026 fiscal year I'm always a
 
02:35:29.270 --> 02:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
little bit confused by that Lakes we'll
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
be starting uh 2024 on July 1st 2023 but
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
and um it would reduce and so it's much
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
more complicated than it is but it
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
passed the law it reduces qualifying
 
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
families co-pay for reduced price meal
 
02:35:44.929 --> 02:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
to Zero from the current
 
02:35:44.939 --> 02:35:45.650 align:start position:0%
to Zero from the current
um

02:35:45.650 --> 02:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
30 cents a day for breakfast and 40
 
02:35:51.290 --> 02:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
cents a day for lunch and uh this leaves
 
02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
the existing distinction between free
 
02:35:54.889 --> 02:35:54.899 align:start position:0%
lunch reduced price lunch families and
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
police how long without you know the
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic stuff that goes with the
 
02:36:00.170 --> 02:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
distinction you know it's
 
02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
how we would write education law if we
 
02:36:05.809 --> 02:36:05.819 align:start position:0%
were starting from scratch but we're not
 
02:36:09.770 --> 02:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
so I I respect that and so there's about
 
02:36:12.349 --> 02:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
5 000 students in reduced price category
 
02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
we'll get free lunches and breakfasts um
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
and I think I think that's a good thing
 
02:36:19.610 --> 02:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
it makes it easier for the families it
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
also saves the school districts a lot of
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
trouble collecting all those small uh
 
02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
co-pays in fact I think they've been
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
paying their breakfast all along because
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
they could be a
 
02:36:29.929 --> 02:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
there's some families who are like
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
paying three cents and it's not worth
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
collecting a three three cent charge so
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's a section four just puts the law
 
02:36:39.969 --> 02:36:39.979 align:start position:0%
books back the way after the two years
 
02:36:42.349 --> 02:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
Sunset back to the way it is right now
 
02:36:44.809 --> 02:36:44.819 align:start position:0%
so that uh and the reason I'm doing for
 
02:36:46.250 --> 02:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
just two years is because I'm fairly
 
02:36:48.410 --> 02:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
certain that there's Federal funding
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
readily available from the Biden
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
administration's economic and pandemic
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
relief packages to finance the expanded
 
02:36:58.130 --> 02:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
program in section two and the federal
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
funding we would well what I've heard
 
02:37:01.790 --> 02:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
another committee or maybe it's just one
 
02:37:03.530 --> 02:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
describes a bucket for receiving the
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
funds so the federal funding we go into
 
02:37:08.510 --> 02:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
that bucket and we could receive money
 
02:37:10.010 --> 02:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
from any Source not just from the
 
02:37:11.450 --> 02:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
federal government but the private
 
02:37:13.969 --> 02:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
sector or even the state government
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
itself and we even just put it into the
 
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
money into the general fund they put it
 
02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
into the meals for students funds and um
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
if this proves to be popular and
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
feasible we could I mean expand make it
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
permanent not to I know the governor
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
said he wants to he wants to concentrate
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
one-time projects but um you know
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to stop us from having
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
permanent projects too and
 
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
we would address that two years from now
 
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
as part of the 26-27 biennial budget and
 
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
my estimate is
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
did across about 375 000 a year above
 
02:37:50.570 --> 02:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
and beyond what our state government our
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
state public schools are already
 
02:37:54.170 --> 02:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
spending and right now that money comes
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
from the families the students if
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're paying if they're paying out but
 
02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
some of them having difficulty doing and
 
02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
I'm confident the federal funding can be
 
02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
found and even this is a fairly
 
02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
inexpensive program so I think would be
 
02:38:07.969 --> 02:38:07.979 align:start position:0%
what we're spending our own money on and
 
02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:38:11.330 --> 02:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
we can't guarantee this always be the
 
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
case but we are currently running a
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
surplus and the governor is even selling
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
them the governor is talking rather
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
expansively on Tuesday he almost sounds
 
02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
anyway I want to say what he sounded
 
02:38:22.370 --> 02:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
like but almost sounded
 
02:38:24.889 --> 02:38:24.899 align:start position:0%
um and um there was there has been some
 
02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
concern about startup costs but my
 
02:38:29.929 --> 02:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
attention my hope would be and if that
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
needs an amendment then you should fix
 
02:38:34.370 --> 02:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
it but I think the startup cost for the
 
02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
schools that aren't serving meals
 
02:38:40.969 --> 02:38:40.979 align:start position:0%
um could be covered under the rubric of
 
02:38:43.610 --> 02:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
the phrase from the bill which is UN
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursed costs of breakfast and lunch
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
meals so anyway this restores expands
 
02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
the free lunches which was
 
02:38:53.170 --> 02:38:53.180 align:start position:0%
a very valuable uh very popular program
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and I know in my
 
02:38:57.290 --> 02:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
school district and thinking virtually
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
all others they decided to just give
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
every kid the lunch for free especially
 
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
when they're while they're delivering
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
the lunches
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
to students at home on the they sent the
 
02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
school bus around every house in my
 
02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
district well every house of the
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
children they didn't stop at my house I
 
02:39:13.870 --> 02:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
have no kids but um
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
they just including the lunch with
 
02:39:18.349 --> 02:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
everybody because if it didn't cost that
 
02:39:20.210 --> 02:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
much there was funding for it and also
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
there thought there were privacy
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
concerns because then believe me the
 
02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
kids would notice and the parents would
 
02:39:28.849 --> 02:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
notice which houses had the bag with the
 
02:39:30.650 --> 02:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
sandwich or whatever the lunch is and
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
which ones didn't get along with the so
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that's my bill it's not a new bill it
 
02:39:38.330 --> 02:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
came pretty close to passing this year
 
02:39:40.849 --> 02:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
and I have a better chance uh I mean
 
02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
came pretty close last year and then I
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:50.090 --> 02:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
yes I'm willing to take prices may not
 
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
be able to answer them but I'm certainly
 
02:39:52.849 --> 02:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
willing to take them back thank you for
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
being willing to take questions
 
02:39:57.410 --> 02:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
question about section five the repeal
 
02:40:00.479 --> 02:40:02.210 align:start position:0%
question about section five the repeal
no

02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
um looking at that section of Statute
 
02:40:07.130 --> 02:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
unless I have the wrong one
 
02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
um one B is related to monies received
 
02:40:11.809 --> 02:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
by the state treasurer shall be
 
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
accounted for in the state's accounting
 
02:40:15.290 --> 02:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
system as General Revenue of the state
 
02:40:19.090 --> 02:40:19.100 align:start position:0%
with the exception of and number 383
 
02:40:21.889 --> 02:40:21.899 align:start position:0%
relates to money's deposited in the New
 
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Solid Waste Management fund
 
02:40:28.370 --> 02:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm wondering how that
 
02:40:30.650 --> 02:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
is it three
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
383 oh
 
02:40:36.770 --> 02:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
well maybe it uh
 
02:40:38.809 --> 02:40:38.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you for thank you for catching
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
it that's a simple Amendment if that's
 
02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:41.750 align:start position:0%
it that's a simple Amendment if that's
uh

02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes we
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
um yeah we don't want to repeal the
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
solid waste fund when this program
 
02:40:48.410 --> 02:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
sunsets because that program may not
 
02:40:50.750 --> 02:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
sunset at the same time I don't see a
 
02:40:54.730 --> 02:40:54.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.450 --> 02:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
yeah that was the idea though yeah this
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
bill would create the program for two
 
02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
years and I I certainly would not be uh
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
I certainly uh if I'm still here as a
 
02:41:08.330 --> 02:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
member of the legislature or as a
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
private citizen either way I said who
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
could be in favor of repealing the
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
sunset and keeping the program going
 
02:41:15.170 --> 02:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
probably depending on how it works I'm
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
sure it'll work fine but you never know
 
02:41:20.210 --> 02:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
but you know that's uh I'm embarrassing
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
I missed missed the typo although I
 
02:41:23.929 --> 02:41:23.939 align:start position:0%
suppose Mario the blame goes with OLS
 
02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
but um yes it was my bill so I I
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
apologize you're certainly welcome to
 
02:41:31.630 --> 02:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
my question representative I need to
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee and to you
 
02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
for not being here at the beginning of
 
02:41:43.370 --> 02:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
your test that's fine oh I I wanted just
 
02:41:46.849 --> 02:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
zero in on the effect of this bill and
 
02:41:50.889 --> 02:41:50.899 align:start position:0%
as I read it it would take the 5 000
 
02:41:53.929 --> 02:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
students you've identified who are now
 
02:41:56.809 --> 02:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
getting reduced priced lunch and make
 
02:42:00.290 --> 02:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
lunch free for those 5 000 students
 
02:42:02.929 --> 02:42:02.939 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah exactly so just the price
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
of the reduced price meal is now zero
 
02:42:13.010 --> 02:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:14.929 --> 02:42:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:42:16.849 --> 02:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh because we've
 
02:42:18.290 --> 02:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
been talking about breakfast and lunch
 
02:42:20.450 --> 02:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
in the committee a bit let me make sure
 
02:42:24.410 --> 02:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
your amendment is only with uh
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
article um letter B under this so does
 
02:42:31.490 --> 02:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
this does the the first line in your
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill still apply that says each School
 
02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
Board shall make breakfast and lunch
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
available during school hours to every
 
02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
pupil under its jurisdiction yeah all
 
02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
right I was wondering if me ask a
 
02:42:45.650 --> 02:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this does this include
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
charter schools and is this a a
 
02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
part one article 28a mandated expense to
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
those schools that are not doing
 
02:42:58.490 --> 02:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
breakfast yet
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
um well that was it was um
 
02:43:03.650 --> 02:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
you know I've heard that heard that
 
02:43:05.690 --> 02:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
before with a similar bill
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
um that was we do have this meals for
 
02:43:11.150 --> 02:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
students funds so my
 
02:43:13.849 --> 02:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
hope is and you may need to tweak the
 
02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
wording of it to make that possible but
 
02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
like the start of cost could be included
 
02:43:21.050 --> 02:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
as the unreimbursed costs so like
 
02:43:22.730 --> 02:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
certainly I mean
 
02:43:25.370 --> 02:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know it's not an unfunded mandate if
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
you fund it and I think it's I think
 
02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's like not it can be funded I think
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
um without uh you know without sending
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
the state into bankruptcy or anything I
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
think that's a fairly modest in my
 
02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
opinion it's a modest cost so you know
 
02:43:43.790 --> 02:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.610 --> 02:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
yes I asked also is our chartered Public
 
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
Schools included in this
 
02:43:50.090 --> 02:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
um that's been a matter of controversy
 
02:43:52.610 --> 02:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
many of them don't serve lunch uh
 
02:43:54.770 --> 02:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
this just talks about the school boards
 
02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:55.730 align:start position:0%
this just talks about the school boards
so

02:43:55.730 --> 02:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so even though every
 
02:44:01.130 --> 02:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
so I think it only plays that's a
 
02:44:02.990 --> 02:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
question you may have to work out for
 
02:44:04.969 --> 02:44:04.979 align:start position:0%
yourself in the exact session this does
 
02:44:06.130 --> 02:44:06.140 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
schools that are under the ages of
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
school boards the most charter schools
 
02:44:12.170 --> 02:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
are are not even though they're all
 
02:44:14.570 --> 02:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
assigned to an SAU there are a few
 
02:44:16.969 --> 02:44:16.979 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that so that would uh
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
maybe I want to include Charter
 
02:44:21.230 --> 02:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
chartered schools that would need more
 
02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
language to it but that creates a lot of
 
02:44:25.929 --> 02:44:25.939 align:start position:0%
difficulty because most of the
 
02:44:28.130 --> 02:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
also some of them don't even have
 
02:44:30.290 --> 02:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
cafeteria facilities at the moment and
 
02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:31.849 align:start position:0%
cafeteria facilities at the moment and
but

02:44:31.849 --> 02:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:44:33.770 --> 02:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
that may be something that may be
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
something the committee wants to look at
 
02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh while you're executing the bill but
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to get to Charter Schools
 
02:44:41.450 --> 02:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
involved but that may take some more
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for bringing this
 
02:44:50.809 --> 02:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
forward you mentioned that this has a
 
02:44:53.929 --> 02:44:53.939 align:start position:0%
sunset currently of two years what
 
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
happens if there's a surplus in the fund
 
02:44:57.950 --> 02:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
what happens with the extra money when
 
02:45:00.170 --> 02:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
the sun sets over and this is no longer
 
02:45:00.180 --> 02:45:02.630 align:start position:0%
the sun sets over and this is no longer
happening

02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.469 --> 02:45:05.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
well it goes I believe it says it's
 
02:45:11.330 --> 02:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and continually appropriate
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education so except
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
of course
 
02:45:17.809 --> 02:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
um except of course we're also like uh
 
02:45:17.819 --> 02:45:19.730 align:start position:0%
um except of course we're also like uh
abolishing

02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
abolishing
 
02:45:22.250 --> 02:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
abolishing the uh thing that does the
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
funds I think if the fund lapses my I
 
02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
I was almost applying to finance two
 
02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
years ago but I luckily I got a reprieve
 
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
but I think those
 
02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
funds would go back into the general
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
fund if that happens but
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you that's something you can
 
02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
address uh that might be another detail
 
02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
that needs to be worked out better than
 
02:45:47.650 --> 02:45:47.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:45:52.969 --> 02:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just to clarify
 
02:45:55.490 --> 02:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is not to
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
no it's a worthy goal but I think we
 
02:46:03.410 --> 02:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
have to start with the school boards
 
02:46:05.450 --> 02:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
because they as I've discovered they
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
don't all have
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
even school lunches at the moment but so
 
02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
the answer to my question is yes yes sir
 
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:21.290 --> 02:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:46:22.969 --> 02:46:22.979 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that those established a
 
02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
fund for the program but requiring
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
breakfast at schools that aren't
 
02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
currently doing it that's going to
 
02:46:32.030 --> 02:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
require staff it's going to require more
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
facilities what's the funding mechanism
 
02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
for all of that
 
02:46:39.410 --> 02:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
well I was that
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
um well that that would ultimately be
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the finance committee that this
 
02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
company decide but we do have this fund
 
02:46:48.530 --> 02:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
which I think the way the law is written
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a lawyer but I think
 
02:46:53.150 --> 02:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
startup costs could be included and we
 
02:46:56.090 --> 02:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
certainly could uh explicitly
 
02:46:58.910 --> 02:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
explicitly say so and then estimate what
 
02:47:00.650 --> 02:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
the startup cost would be they seem to
 
02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:01.370 align:start position:0%
the startup cost would be they seem to
have

02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:47:03.050 --> 02:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
that seems to be a pretty good handle on
 
02:47:05.090 --> 02:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
what they what this what the startup
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and I apologize if
 
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
I didn't understand this the the first
 
02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
first time you said it um
 
02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:25.070 align:start position:0%
first time you said it um
okay

02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.230 --> 02:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
um but and and actually and I know I
 
02:47:29.210 --> 02:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
didn't understand it uh a year or two
 
02:47:31.250 --> 02:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
ago when when the first time
 
02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
um this came through but could you sort
 
02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
of walk through what this you know what
 
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
like like on lines 15 and 16 you've got
 
02:47:42.889 --> 02:47:42.899 align:start position:0%
a three cent reimbursement and then
 
02:47:45.889 --> 02:47:45.899 align:start position:0%
there's a 27 Cent reimbursement where
 
02:47:48.650 --> 02:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
that comes from what it's for what uh
 
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
what and what it all means and I noticed
 
02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:53.540 align:start position:0%
that there was something in the in the
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
budget note 40 cents versus 30 cents
 
02:47:59.330 --> 02:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what it's all that about oh
 
02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
good question well that was um I mean
 
02:48:03.889 --> 02:48:03.899 align:start position:0%
existing I'm taking the existing law so
 
02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm only creating I'm only
 
02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
changing the things that are well as you
 
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
know straight and uh so right now it
 
02:48:12.530 --> 02:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
says uh and that this is a law that
 
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
established the school breakfast program
 
02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
which was uh past two or three years ago
 
02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:18.950 align:start position:0%
which was uh past two or three years ago
so

02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
like the like in line 13 right now says
 
02:48:24.590 --> 02:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's such School providing breakfast
 
02:48:26.809 --> 02:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
meals to pupils so now it says breakfast
 
02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
crossout meals and lunch did peoples and
 
02:48:32.690 --> 02:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
meter exceed and then there's that same
 
02:48:34.969 --> 02:48:34.979 align:start position:0%
language breakfast meal it's a change to
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch
 
02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
then also says the department shall
 
02:48:42.530 --> 02:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
provide funding from the meals for
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch and uh
 
02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
so that's and then some paragraph C is
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
new too so that establishes the fund
 
02:48:51.469 --> 02:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
that the the primary education would be
 
02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:57.889 --> 02:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah and so the funding is
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
this three Cent and 27 Cent
 
02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
I think if my amendments passed it'll be
 
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
37 cents because apparently the people
 
02:49:07.849 --> 02:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
who are at the fiscal know that the
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh they rightly
 
02:49:13.730 --> 02:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
played out that three and 27 adds up to
 
02:49:16.130 --> 02:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
30 not 40 which is the amount of money
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
we need to get the three lunches and a
 
02:49:22.969 --> 02:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
final follow-up on that well so is is is
 
02:49:25.969 --> 02:49:25.979 align:start position:0%
that what it costs schools to provide to
 
02:49:29.450 --> 02:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
provide a a meal to a student they do it
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
for 40 cents no it's significantly more
 
02:49:33.889 --> 02:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
than that but some of the rest of it's
 
02:49:35.090 --> 02:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
made up from
 
02:49:37.849 --> 02:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
from various various various other
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
sources including
 
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
sources including
um

02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:43.250 --> 02:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
equally selling meals to the adults in
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
it and there's money kicked into the
 
02:49:46.490 --> 02:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
school district and there's Federal
 
02:49:49.370 --> 02:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
funding this and even if you're paying a
 
02:49:51.230 --> 02:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
full price student meal that's also
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
subsidized so the and I forget the exact
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
so this is funding on top of this is an
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
addition to what's already have it's all
 
02:49:59.450 --> 02:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
everybody who eats there probably
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
including the adults but certainly all
 
02:50:02.690 --> 02:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
the students they're all they're all
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
subsidized to some degree another I'm
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
just increasing the subsidy for this
 
02:50:08.270 --> 02:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
group that's in the middle in between
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
the free meal and the oak rice meal okay
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
oh my I haven't haven't uh haven't heard
 
02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
from them much this year but I did work
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
with them and to speak my
 
02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
superintendent's office and um like two
 
02:50:34.969 --> 02:50:34.979 align:start position:0%
years ago when I did this originally
 
02:50:37.610 --> 02:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
this this is basically the repeat of
 
02:50:40.010 --> 02:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
something that narrowly failed last time
 
02:50:41.630 --> 02:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
so I mean I
 
02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:54.889 align:start position:0%
so I mean I
can

02:50:54.889 --> 02:50:54.899 align:start position:0%

to pass
 
04:04:13.849 --> 04:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
please then purchased Me by cordelli's

04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes I do um from the sponsor I I've
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
heard she said previously Charter School
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
additional monies went through the
 
04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee the department now
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
draws a warrant for additional monies
 
04:04:38.210 --> 04:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
for charter schools so there is no need
 
04:04:40.090 --> 04:04:40.100 align:start position:0%
to go through the fiscal committee
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
despite the report no longer being
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
needed the Department of Education
 
04:04:46.309 --> 04:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
continues to do it amounting to
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 hours of Staff time the
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee has never once asked a
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
but it's just not needed this is it's
 
04:05:02.090 --> 04:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
not going through the the uh the
 
04:05:04.490 --> 04:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
channels that this original RSA
 
04:05:10.490 --> 04:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:10.500 --> 04:05:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.370 --> 04:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:05:19.250 --> 04:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno thank you thank
 
04:05:22.010 --> 04:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair so so
 
04:05:22.020 --> 04:05:23.210 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair so so
um

04:05:23.210 --> 04:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:27.469 --> 04:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:29.630 --> 04:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
just because the fiscal committee may
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
not be interested in this report I'm not
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
sure I I guess having not seen the
 
04:05:39.229 --> 04:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
report it's unclear to me whether or not
 
04:05:42.290 --> 04:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
the report would have value otherwise to
 
04:05:45.229 --> 04:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
either make sure that the um that the
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
department of Ed education is properly
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
funding uh Charter Schools or if um and
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of wrinkles I think
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of the funding of charter
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.290 --> 04:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
chartered from the Department of
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
Education or your chartered and I I
 
04:06:07.610 --> 04:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
don't think we have any charter schools
 
04:06:10.510 --> 04:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
that are currently chartered directly
 
04:06:13.010 --> 04:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
conversion schools but there are
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
different funding parameters I think
 
04:06:16.729 --> 04:06:16.739 align:start position:0%
depending upon how you're charted
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
chartered and I think the value of the
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
report may still um
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
um still have some Merit and um and
 
04:06:24.600 --> 04:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
um still have some Merit and um and
possibly

04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
rather than directing the
 
04:06:32.090 --> 04:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
the the report to the finance committee
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
possibly it should be directed I mean to
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee possibly it should
 
04:06:38.330 --> 04:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
be directed to the finance committee and
 
04:06:43.250 --> 04:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:45.790 --> 04:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on that
 
04:06:47.630 --> 04:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's not that
 
04:06:51.889 --> 04:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
there's not a report it's just that
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
there does not need to be the multiple
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
reports that are in this um section A
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
lot right now and going through the
 
04:07:00.530 --> 04:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and it's not it's my
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
understanding they still report things
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
but they don't need to do it uh every
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
time that they get a money
 
04:07:10.610 --> 04:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
dispersed so the idea would be to cut
 
04:07:13.610 --> 04:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
down on the number and put it to the
 
04:07:15.170 --> 04:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
right place that's accepting the report
 
04:07:18.290 --> 04:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:21.290 --> 04:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative thank
 
04:07:21.300 --> 04:07:22.189 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative thank
you

04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:07:26.330 --> 04:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
um looking at the statute the report
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
goes to the fiscal committee for each
 
04:07:31.370 --> 04:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
payment made during the year to a
 
04:07:33.290 --> 04:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
chartered school and contains the name
 
04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
and name and address of the school the
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
amount of payment and the number of
 
04:07:40.130 --> 04:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
students currently enrolled so if the
 
04:07:43.729 --> 04:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
intent is to verify that they're getting
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
the right amount based on the number of
 
04:07:49.729 --> 04:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
pupils I think that that is a doe
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility since they are making the
 
04:07:53.750 --> 04:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
payments rather than the fiscal
 
04:07:53.760 --> 04:07:56.210 align:start position:0%
payments rather than the fiscal
committee

04:07:56.210 --> 04:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:08:01.969 --> 04:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
uh representative you know
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
any kind of reports that come back to
 
04:08:05.809 --> 04:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
the education committee
 
04:08:07.929 --> 04:08:07.939 align:start position:0%
probably would never be read
 
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
we have numerous reports by Statute we
 
04:08:15.889 --> 04:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
say report to the various education
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
Committee of the house and the Senate
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
and we don't meet during the summer time
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
at all
 
04:08:25.610 --> 04:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
and in the spring we're unloading you
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
know and voting and we're very rarely
 
04:08:29.929 --> 04:08:29.939 align:start position:0%
are looking at information coming in
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
such we talk about here in this bill
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the same thing for the fall
 
04:08:37.070 --> 04:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
um so there's time I don't think the
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
sending these reports to the education
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
committee would be you know beneficial
 
04:08:42.410 --> 04:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
at all
 
04:08:44.929 --> 04:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
um I don't I know for half that stuff's
 
04:08:47.450 --> 04:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
not even read that we get we get Oodles
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
of stuff coming in
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
and it Stacks out there on that desk so
 
04:08:56.210 --> 04:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
so to that and I I I agree with that
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
um that stuff does stack up however you
 
04:09:02.090 --> 04:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
know I I think since I've been on the
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
education Community actually prior to
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
being on the education committee I'd
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
certainly be looking at um the uh the
 
04:09:12.410 --> 04:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
doe grants to uh to a public school
 
04:09:15.889 --> 04:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
districts do they have a um a similar
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
report that um that they have available
 
04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
for uh for Charters have have people
 
04:09:23.689 --> 04:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
been seeing that and have people
 
04:09:26.450 --> 04:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
compared that to what um what is being
 
04:09:29.689 --> 04:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
proposed in this repeal bill
 
04:09:31.130 --> 04:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
I mean just to make sure we're not
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
losing losing some piece of information
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
I can't respond to that you know have
 
04:09:41.090 --> 04:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
you ever seen one of these reports
 
04:09:42.769 --> 04:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
pardon me have you seen one of these
 
04:09:47.150 --> 04:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I ask them if I want to see one of
 
04:09:52.610 --> 04:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
those reports well maybe if you see one
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to see more I mean I
 
04:09:56.929 --> 04:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know
 
04:10:00.290 --> 04:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
all right so um so so
 
04:10:03.650 --> 04:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair does is this an this isn't
 
04:10:06.530 --> 04:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
early do we need to act today
 
04:10:09.050 --> 04:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
none of these bills that we have left on
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
this list are early bills right right so
 
04:10:13.610 --> 04:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
they all have to be acted on by March
 
04:10:13.620 --> 04:10:14.750 align:start position:0%
they all have to be acted on by March
16th

04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
16th
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
so so with with this one here
 
04:10:19.729 --> 04:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just sort of talking out loud
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
and so I hope you know uh Mel I hope
 
04:10:25.490 --> 04:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
that's okay on this that that it would
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
seem to be this this should be
 
04:10:30.650 --> 04:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing or something close to that
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
one way or the other on this committee
 
04:10:34.610 --> 04:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
is there anything we can do to try to
 
04:10:36.349 --> 04:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
get it to that
 
04:10:38.210 --> 04:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
hey if you can suggest a way to do that
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
I agree I for all the bills Hit the
 
04:10:43.010 --> 04:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
Floor has no recommendation especially a
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
bill like this yeah which is this is
 
04:10:48.469 --> 04:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
being submitted To Us by what doe right
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
right right but we didn't actually hear
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
from Dewey oh actually Diana was it
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
though yes but she was but but she
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of background in no
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
but it was mentioned that doe this is a
 
04:11:03.889 --> 04:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
technical thing I've got that yeah but I
 
04:11:07.610 --> 04:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
I guess as as long as we can be assured
 
04:11:10.010 --> 04:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
that there's that that there's a report
 
04:11:12.170 --> 04:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
available that Zoe will continue to make
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
a report available and that that
 
04:11:17.150 --> 04:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they're making available is at
 
04:11:19.729 --> 04:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
least contains the information that's in
 
04:11:21.769 --> 04:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
in this report then I think we could
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:27.110 --> 04:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
I can't believe that the reports which
 
04:11:28.429 --> 04:11:28.439 align:start position:0%
they receive
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
are not available they're public
 
04:11:30.720 --> 04:11:32.150 align:start position:0%
are not available they're public
documents

04:11:32.150 --> 04:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
documents
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen it well I know yeah
 
04:11:37.969 --> 04:11:37.979 align:start position:0%
yeah reps and dry
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you reports on charter
 
04:11:42.290 --> 04:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
school funding can be found in the doe
 
04:11:44.929 --> 04:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
website at any time the Senate passed an
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
identical Bill SB 25 by Voice vote
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
who was that from Maureen Mooney okay
 
04:11:58.490 --> 04:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
04:12:01.729 --> 04:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
04:12:04.849 --> 04:12:04.859 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly when the doe did
 
04:12:06.110 --> 04:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
talk to us
 
04:12:08.689 --> 04:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
they said that public schools are not
 
04:12:11.929 --> 04:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
doing this particular report that the
 
04:12:14.150 --> 04:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
charter schools are doing those other
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
reports that the public schools are
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
doing but this particular report where
 
04:12:18.969 --> 04:12:18.979 align:start position:0%
they have to report
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
every single
 
04:12:22.040 --> 04:12:23.929 align:start position:0%
every single
payment

04:12:23.929 --> 04:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
is not the public schools don't do this
 
04:12:30.349 --> 04:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
and so that was at any rate that was an
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:37.490 --> 04:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
are there further comment yes
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden um just to add
 
04:12:41.090 --> 04:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:12:42.650 --> 04:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
um what they have on the department of
 
04:12:44.750 --> 04:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
Ed website and the this is the only
 
04:12:46.250 --> 04:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
thing I could find I don't know if
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
there's something else was the Charter
 
04:12:52.729 --> 04:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
School per pupil aid for 21 22 so it it
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
lists their total ADM
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
they're per pupil Aid and their
 
04:12:59.150 --> 04:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
differentiated AIDS so those are the
 
04:13:03.130 --> 04:13:03.140 align:start position:0%
there's no detailed Financial or fiscal
 
04:13:05.809 --> 04:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
reports like there are for the public
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
schools and their accountability plan
 
04:13:11.809 --> 04:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
really has no fiscal uh information tied
 
04:13:14.929 --> 04:13:14.939 align:start position:0%
to it either it's all goals driven and
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
how they're going to measure it so
 
04:13:20.750 --> 04:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
to me to take it off the books leaves it
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
open-ended for accountability in the on
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Myler oh
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you San cordelli thank you Mr
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair would it be possible to hold this
 
04:13:35.570 --> 04:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
and have somebody somebody from the
 
04:13:37.849 --> 04:13:37.859 align:start position:0%
Department who actually deals with this
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
come and provide some sense of
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
clarification notwithstanding
 
04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
representing Mooney's uh communique but
 
04:13:45.469 --> 04:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear somebody who actually
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
manages this thing that can be able to
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
give us an indication and if in fact uh
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
it is what it is we may be able to have
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
a 2020 vote on this but right now I'm
 
04:13:57.290 --> 04:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
not going to vote for this unless I get
 
04:13:59.330 --> 04:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
some information directly from the
 
04:13:59.340 --> 04:14:03.490 align:start position:0%
some information directly from the
Department

04:14:03.490 --> 04:14:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:05.809 --> 04:14:05.819 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:14:05.819 --> 04:14:08.769 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
cordelli

04:14:08.769 --> 04:14:08.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.410 --> 04:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
I I think that the main report
 
04:14:15.349 --> 04:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
um that would be of interest is what was
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
just pointed out on doe website that
 
04:14:21.889 --> 04:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
shows the uh the enrollment and the uh
 
04:14:23.809 --> 04:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
the amount that they're eligible for
 
04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
even including the differentiated Aid I
 
04:14:28.010 --> 04:14:28.020 align:start position:0%

from
 
04:15:55.790 --> 04:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative drive there
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
um then you know we're just going to
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
continue on and March was
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know tried to you know figure this
 
04:16:05.210 --> 04:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
out a direction we can go so we can come
 
04:16:06.889 --> 04:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
onto the floor with something that's a
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
little bit Yeah more
 
04:16:10.610 --> 04:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
something on consent
 
04:16:12.130 --> 04:16:12.140 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah
 
04:16:15.170 --> 04:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay so what we're going to do is close
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
this portion of the executive session
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
down we're going to leave this so Madam
 
04:16:22.610 --> 04:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
clerk we have a motion on the floor on
 
04:16:25.370 --> 04:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
the pass was it 10 10 where that's where
 
04:16:27.110 --> 04:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're stopping
 
04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
hold good you got the word hold in big
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
print big printed printed okay
 
04:16:33.960 --> 04:16:35.510 align:start position:0%
print big printed printed okay
alrighty

04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
alrighty
 
04:16:35.520 --> 04:16:37.849 align:start position:0%
alrighty
um

04:16:37.849 --> 04:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
going down
 
04:16:43.610 --> 04:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
um it's 382 we've done that already 6
 
04:16:46.010 --> 04:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
34. I'm going to hold off in this one in
 
04:16:48.530 --> 04:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
case there's a couple bills we know that
 
04:16:51.889 --> 04:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
there's probably Mutual consent here and
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put them at the end in case
 
04:16:55.370 --> 04:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
somebody has to scoot out of here and we
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
want to continue exacting
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to jump over to 441 right
 
04:17:02.809 --> 04:17:02.819 align:start position:0%
now or down to it
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
eliminating residency requires for
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.760 --> 04:17:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I move itl on House Bill 441
 
04:17:18.769 --> 04:17:18.779 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:17:24.710 --> 04:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
so the motion on eliminating residency
 
04:17:27.889 --> 04:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
requirements for public school
 
04:17:31.729 --> 04:17:31.739 align:start position:0%
attendance is itl made by representative
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
and second by represent dry
 
04:17:37.969 --> 04:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
representative do you have any comments
 
04:17:40.849 --> 04:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I think this is an
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
interesting idea but I don't think that
 
04:17:44.809 --> 04:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
the funding formula in the state
 
04:17:44.819 --> 04:17:46.309 align:start position:0%
the funding formula in the state
supports

04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
supports
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
this type of movement between school
 
04:17:51.650 --> 04:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.290 --> 04:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
represent dry do you have any comments
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes I think it's it's a complicated
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
subject and we haven't given it
 
04:17:59.570 --> 04:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
certainly nearly enough time to talk it
 
04:17:59.580 --> 04:18:02.030 align:start position:0%
certainly nearly enough time to talk it
through

04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.150 --> 04:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
I have one comment that I'd like to make
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
is that been involved with Athletics all
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
my life and
 
04:18:14.689 --> 04:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
um knowing and seeing things like this
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
happened where I was in charge of the
 
04:18:19.250 --> 04:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
intersclastic Athletics for the state of
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
Alaska we saw certain schools become
 
04:18:24.050 --> 04:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
hockey schools
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
and they were the division one champions
 
04:18:29.330 --> 04:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
for a year after year after year simply
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
because they're going to where they want
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
to go to school
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
and it really kind of you know
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
eliminated any other school from being
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
competitive at all so I agree I think
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
that there is our number of issues
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
Athletics is just one that
 
04:18:46.800 --> 04:18:47.750 align:start position:0%
Athletics is just one that
um

04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
we need to discuss are even to
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe pursue in the future
 
04:18:55.309 --> 04:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
but the way this bill is written right
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
now I agree I think it needs to be itl
 
04:19:03.050 --> 04:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:10.250 --> 04:19:10.260 align:start position:0%

okay

04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay the next bill which we have going
 
04:20:12.769 --> 04:20:12.779 align:start position:0%
down is hb104
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
relative to multi-style bathrooms and
 
04:20:17.450 --> 04:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
locker rooms and schools
 
04:20:20.150 --> 04:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
so in 104 I I recognize representative
 
04:20:22.250 --> 04:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
cardelli for a motion uh thank you I'd
 
04:20:25.010 --> 04:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
like to move like to pass
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second represent Belcher
 
04:20:30.530 --> 04:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:20:36.889 --> 04:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe that this bill we hear a
 
04:20:40.210 --> 04:20:40.220 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony about building codes
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
and uh the impact on this bill but it
 
04:20:47.210 --> 04:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
seems to me from that testimony that
 
04:20:52.689 --> 04:20:52.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:55.309 --> 04:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
future building codes who knows what's
 
04:20:59.090 --> 04:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
going to happen the legislature votes on
 
04:21:02.090 --> 04:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
building codes so if some building code
 
04:21:05.330 --> 04:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
comes down in a year two years whatever
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
it might be there's no guarantee that we
 
04:21:10.849 --> 04:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
are going to modify or pass the building
 
04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
codes as is and change what is current
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
law in terms of the building codes so
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that is my primary reason in supporting
 
04:21:21.000 --> 04:21:22.610 align:start position:0%
that is my primary reason in supporting
this

04:21:22.610 --> 04:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
04:21:27.290 --> 04:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I would just I
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
would just say that for
 
04:21:32.269 --> 04:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
going back in history this has always
 
04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
been done keeping male and female spaces
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
separate for a very good reason
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
it is entirely clear that on average men
 
04:21:41.809 --> 04:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
are stronger it is entirely clear that
 
04:21:44.570 --> 04:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
on average men are more dangerous it is
 
04:21:46.490 --> 04:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
entirely clear that on average women
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
receive more sexual attention than men
 
04:21:51.410 --> 04:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
do and it is for these reasons that we
 
04:21:54.530 --> 04:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
have to protect female spaces
 
04:21:56.809 --> 04:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
04:22:01.490 --> 04:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
I want to read this brief message from
 
04:22:06.110 --> 04:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
my colleague Leslie McGregor who's a
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner who is director of
 
04:22:10.729 --> 04:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
the Bayard Health Center at Kobe server
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
college for a number of years
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
and I believe lives in Plainfield
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
to The Honorable members of the House
 
04:22:18.650 --> 04:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
Education committee HP 104
 
04:22:21.290 --> 04:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
oversimplifies the question of gender it
 
04:22:22.969 --> 04:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
is unfortunate that the construct of
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
gender is more complicated than we have
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
always thought but wishing it were
 
04:22:28.610 --> 04:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
simpler doesn't make it so
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
we know there are individuals who don't
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
feel the gender they were assigned at
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
Birth fits their self-image we know that
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
some are born with ambiguous genitalia
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
mismatched genitals and gonads or sex
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
chromosomes that are other than XX or XY
 
04:22:44.450 --> 04:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
this is biology the fact that these
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
phenomena are relatively rare doesn't
 
04:22:48.170 --> 04:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
take away our responsibility as a
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
society to make space for anyone for
 
04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
whom these things are true
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
so saying a locker room or bathroom
 
04:22:55.250 --> 04:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
needs to be same-sex doesn't solve
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
anything it simply denies the existence
 
04:23:00.110 --> 04:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
of the examples I listed that's a
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
horrible thing to do to anyone isn't it
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
and she says please vote this bill down
 
04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
and focus on making our schools
 
04:23:08.210 --> 04:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and locker rooms safe for
 
04:23:09.889 --> 04:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
everyone that would be a real
 
04:23:09.899 --> 04:23:11.150 align:start position:0%
everyone that would be a real
accomplishment

04:23:11.150 --> 04:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishment
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
I concur
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
04:23:21.469 --> 04:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
thank you just want to remind that um
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
that really it isn't just black and
 
04:23:24.180 --> 04:23:25.429 align:start position:0%
that really it isn't just black and
white

04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
white
 
04:23:28.130 --> 04:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
but schools are service providers to
 
04:23:28.140 --> 04:23:29.150 align:start position:0%
but schools are service providers to
kids

04:23:29.150 --> 04:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:23:31.729 --> 04:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
and what's best for kids
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:39.729 --> 04:23:39.739 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Myler
 
04:23:43.610 --> 04:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:47.450 --> 04:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:47.460 --> 04:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:48.720 --> 04:23:49.969 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:23:49.969 --> 04:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:53.450 --> 04:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
it's not like when I grew up
 
04:23:56.929 --> 04:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
boys or boys girls were girls
 
04:23:58.969 --> 04:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
it's a different time
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
I vividly remember
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
several years ago when we dealt with the
 
04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
Trans athlete issue
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
and we had a young
 
04:24:13.490 --> 04:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
student up here before this committee
 
04:24:17.689 --> 04:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
it was a first time publicly that she
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
came out
 
04:24:24.830 --> 04:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
and she said to us you know
 
04:24:27.050 --> 04:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
I love to play soccer and none of none
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
of my students one of my friends at home
 
04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
know I'm trans
 
04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
it's the first time
 
04:24:37.849 --> 04:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
her mother Then followed up
 
04:24:40.490 --> 04:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
and went through
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
an assessment of what they have done to
 
04:24:46.250 --> 04:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
support their daughter
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
the hormonal treatments that went
 
04:24:48.359 --> 04:24:50.750 align:start position:0%
the hormonal treatments that went
through

04:24:50.750 --> 04:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
the psychological issues that they went
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
through both as a family and as an
 
04:24:55.080 --> 04:24:58.070 align:start position:0%
through both as a family and as an
individual

04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.130 --> 04:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
herdicide her decision
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
to change her sexual orientation was not
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
an easy one
 
04:25:09.530 --> 04:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
because of satire issues that that are
 
04:25:13.250 --> 04:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
there with Transit individuals
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
it had a profound impact upon me
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
I I it's it's an area that I don't know
 
04:25:21.050 --> 04:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
much about
 
04:25:23.090 --> 04:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
I admit that
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
but she
 
04:25:27.650 --> 04:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
this small student
 
04:25:30.650 --> 04:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
had a major impact upon my look at when
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't just decide oh I'm
 
04:25:36.050 --> 04:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to be a boy I'm going to be a girl
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy decision
 
04:25:42.769 --> 04:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
but when they make that decision
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
how does society treat that individual
 
04:25:47.929 --> 04:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
that's the issue here
 
04:25:50.809 --> 04:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
and if if an individual has decided that
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
04:25:57.110 --> 04:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
come out and whatever choice they make
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:03.349 --> 04:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
where do I go to the bathroom
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
04:26:07.130 --> 04:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
does she have to go to the male bathroom
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
she looks just like a girl
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
dresses just like a girl
 
04:26:16.130 --> 04:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
she's gonna go to the male bathroom
 
04:26:19.809 --> 04:26:19.819 align:start position:0%
because it says that was what her birth
 
04:26:23.809 --> 04:26:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is a very important issue for us to
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
deal with here because we've got a lot
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
of kids
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
who have made this decision with their
 
04:26:32.399 --> 04:26:33.649 align:start position:0%
who have made this decision with their
family

04:26:33.649 --> 04:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:26:35.929 --> 04:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
we often talk about parental rights here
 
04:26:39.410 --> 04:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
students make that decision not by
 
04:26:41.520 --> 04:26:44.149 align:start position:0%
students make that decision not by
themselves

04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you not to support
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
this OTP motion
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli uh
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:26:57.849 --> 04:26:57.859 align:start position:0%
um we have also heard testimony from
 
04:27:02.050 --> 04:27:02.060 align:start position:0%
someone who identified as gender fluid
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
and they changed their gender identity
 
04:27:07.149 --> 04:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
in their mind
 
04:27:10.490 --> 04:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes on a daily or weekly basis
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
and had to actually decide which soccer
 
04:27:16.610 --> 04:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
team the girls or the boys soccer team
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
they wanted to play on
 
04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what their genitalia
 
04:27:22.670 --> 04:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
04:27:25.250 --> 04:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:27:29.450 --> 04:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
um but how how do we accommodate that
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
um if someone's gender is changing on a
 
04:27:34.610 --> 04:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
weekly basis
 
04:27:34.620 --> 04:27:35.809 align:start position:0%
weekly basis
um

04:27:35.809 --> 04:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:39.769 --> 04:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
you know the culture is changing in many
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
04:27:44.170 --> 04:27:44.180 align:start position:0%
um some of it is very troubling to me
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
but I certainly respect that every
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
person is an individual
 
04:27:53.330 --> 04:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
and every person deserves respect but I
 
04:27:55.969 --> 04:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is the way to show
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
that respect further discussion
 
04:28:02.050 --> 04:28:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.370 --> 04:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
04:28:07.610 --> 04:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh came clear during the dialogue from
 
04:28:08.750 --> 04:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
one was the first word that says all and
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
I asked about that as he recalls and the
 
04:28:16.250 --> 04:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
building Folks by all he said that would
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
mean that every public school would have
 
04:28:20.210 --> 04:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
to eliminate all their gender-neutral
 
04:28:23.090 --> 04:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
bathrooms in that school
 
04:28:26.689 --> 04:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
says right there Paulie all so the ones
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
you have here you have to go out now
 
04:28:29.929 --> 04:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing the second thing
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
is we have team at the team at the team
 
04:28:34.250 --> 04:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
that go to schools in Haverhill and
 
04:28:36.050 --> 04:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
schools and Conway and schools and
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro where the visiting team comes
 
04:28:40.250 --> 04:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
in they go in the office of the locker
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
room all the boys go on the girls locker
 
04:28:43.969 --> 04:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
room and all the girls go in the boys
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
locker room depending what site they
 
04:28:46.610 --> 04:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
happen to be on that particular day in
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
that particular team
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
what happens then the violation of the
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
law you're trying to pass well those
 
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
kids can't well haven't changed outside
 
04:28:56.530 --> 04:28:56.540 align:start position:0%
as far as gender neutral and and
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
representative cordiality's gender fluid
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
sorry soccer example the nhia clearly
 
04:29:05.389 --> 04:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
has rules for that they don't go one to
 
04:29:06.889 --> 04:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
you today one to you tomorrow come on
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
Glenn that doesn't happen we know that I
 
04:29:10.849 --> 04:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
don't believe that does not happen I I
 
04:29:12.290 --> 04:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
didn't say that they should they went
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
from one team to another they had to
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
choose which team they wanted to be yeah
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's very clear and it's highest when
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
they choose as a set for season for the
 
04:29:21.649 --> 04:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
year the last thing is the the we heard
 
04:29:23.510 --> 04:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
testimony again there are over 700 trans
 
04:29:25.130 --> 04:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
to athletes right now in New Hampshire
 
04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
excuse not athletes trans students in
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
in our schools and that with that piece
 
04:29:32.809 --> 04:29:32.819 align:start position:0%
they talked about the problems they had
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
with some of these youngsters who were
 
04:29:37.969 --> 04:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
forced into the genitalia appropriate
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
locker room and the harassment
 
04:29:41.090 --> 04:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
additional harassment they got at that
 
04:29:42.530 --> 04:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
so if we've taken out gender neutral so
 
04:29:46.490 --> 04:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
we give them no option and now we're
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
gonna force them into a discriminary
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
place I think we're going backwards by
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
trying to help youth in the 21st century
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I listened to the
 
04:30:01.250 --> 04:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
testimony the other day and I heard
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
people who were afraid to go to the
 
04:30:06.410 --> 04:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
bathroom and so held it all day because
 
04:30:08.269 --> 04:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
there might be somebody the opposite sex
 
04:30:10.490 --> 04:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
in their bathroom and then I heard
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that that would hold all day
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't
 
04:30:15.889 --> 04:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
be respected for the choice that they
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
had made and I think there's a middle
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
ground here somewhere that we have not
 
04:30:21.889 --> 04:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
examined I'm going to vote ought to pass
 
04:30:24.110 --> 04:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't pass I would like to
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
retain this because I think we can work
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
this out but I don't think that we are
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
are at that place yet
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
04:30:37.130 --> 04:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just like to
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
clarify a bit of the language in the
 
04:30:42.050 --> 04:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
middle too it opens all multi-stall
 
04:30:42.060 --> 04:30:44.330 align:start position:0%
middle too it opens all multi-stall
bathrooms

04:30:44.330 --> 04:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
bathrooms
 
04:30:48.110 --> 04:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
um so the gender neutral sort bathrooms
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
that are single occupancy or family
 
04:30:49.800 --> 04:30:51.469 align:start position:0%
that are single occupancy or family
restrooms

04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
restrooms
 
04:30:53.809 --> 04:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
um would not be affected by this bill
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's only multi-stall restrooms and I
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
think the intent of the bill is exactly
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
that to not have biological male and
 
04:31:03.649 --> 04:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
biological females occupying the same
 
04:31:06.290 --> 04:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
space in the same restroom
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
um I've heard a lot of talking about
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
gender gender the idea of gender as a
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
social construct that goes back a long
 
04:31:13.849 --> 04:31:13.859 align:start position:0%
time in social sciences Judith Butler
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
and all we have never ever
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
assigned bathrooms based on gender we
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%

Works nice uh uh representative McDonald
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
I recognize you for a motion thank you
 
04:32:40.130 --> 04:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'd like to move to retain
 
04:32:43.490 --> 04:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay and to speak on the retained motion
 
04:32:49.210 --> 04:32:49.220 align:start position:0%
I think both sides made some good points
 
04:32:51.769 --> 04:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
there just doesn't seem to be a need for
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
this at this time I do not believe that
 
04:32:57.649 --> 04:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
this will really accomplish anything and
 
04:32:59.210 --> 04:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
it could discriminate against a
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
particular group of New Hampshire
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
students no matter how small that group
 
04:33:06.051 --> 04:33:06.061 align:start position:0%
and I do not believe as representative
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
dry mentioned the building code would
 
04:33:11.689 --> 04:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
comply with this as well so at the very
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
least we should wait to make a decision
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
on this until that were to be updated
 
04:33:17.929 --> 04:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
and again there are several places
 
04:33:20.570 --> 04:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
within the bill as worded that I find
 
04:33:23.929 --> 04:33:23.939 align:start position:0%
con confusing and conflicting with
 
04:33:26.689 --> 04:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
existing statutes such as the word all
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned I think it's
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
restrictive of many groups of students
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
who might find themselves in certain
 
04:33:35.449 --> 04:33:35.459 align:start position:0%
categories under many groups of
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
different gender identities and for this
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
reason I do not believe this bill should
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
pass at this time and should be
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
reconsidered by the committee at a later
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
04:33:47.449 --> 04:33:47.459 align:start position:0%
and I I will respond that I think
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald uh said it all
 
04:33:52.730 --> 04:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
very very well there's a lot of work
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done on this before I
 
04:33:59.209 --> 04:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
will be prepared to move on this topic
 
04:34:02.449 --> 04:34:02.459 align:start position:0%
so uh I very much support the the need
 
04:34:04.490 --> 04:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
for retention
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%

04:35:23.631 --> 04:35:23.641 align:start position:0%
Miss Dame is going to have a motion
 
04:35:23.641 --> 04:35:25.310 align:start position:0%

woodcock

04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.689 --> 04:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
so in addition to what I already stated
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
about the reality that we're trying to
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
oversimplify gender inappropriately
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth noting the
 
04:35:53.330 --> 04:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
substantially increased risk of suicide
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
in the population of people who are
 
04:35:55.619 --> 04:35:57.051 align:start position:0%
in the population of people who are
trans

represent McDonald thank you I have a
 
04:36:38.631 --> 04:36:38.641 align:start position:0%
question what is the procedure if this
 
04:36:40.970 --> 04:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
motion fails because the prior two
 
04:36:43.250 --> 04:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
motions also failed it'd be a no
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
Smiler do your red lights on there just

04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
is there a reconsideration on your vote

04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%

04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
so this bill comes out with no
 
04:38:42.240 --> 04:38:51.230 align:start position:0%
so this bill comes out with no
recommendation

04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%

and I assume representative cordelli you
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.929 --> 04:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
the next one down below 104 we're going
 
04:39:19.070 --> 04:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.080 --> 04:39:21.551 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:39:21.551 --> 04:39:21.561 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:24.051 --> 04:39:24.061 align:start position:0%
hb505 represent Belcher you're
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
recognized for a motion
 
04:39:30.769 --> 04:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would move itl
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:40.250 --> 04:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher is there a discussion
 
04:39:40.260 --> 04:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher is there a discussion
yes

04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
um so this this bill is about
 
04:39:46.850 --> 04:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Mental Health um being
 
04:39:49.368 --> 04:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
added to School curriculum
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
um first I'd like to say the word
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive I think that throws a lot
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
of us for a little bit of loop I'm not
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
quite sure exactly what that means I am
 
04:39:57.770 --> 04:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
aware of some other programs that have
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
come in under the broad term
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and they've been
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
less than desirable ultimately
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh second
 
04:40:08.930 --> 04:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
I believe mental health education should
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
really be undertaken only by those
 
04:40:13.850 --> 04:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
trained professionals who are trained
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
and licensed to do so trained and
 
04:40:17.448 --> 04:40:17.458 align:start position:0%
licensed and prepared to handle any
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
potential Fallout that may occur during
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
such training
 
04:40:23.760 --> 04:40:25.190 align:start position:0%
such training
again

04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:40:25.200 --> 04:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
again
um

04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
when we get into ideas such as self-care
 
04:40:31.130 --> 04:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
mindfulness and other things believe it
 
04:40:32.570 --> 04:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
or not we're actually starting to bump
 
04:40:34.368 --> 04:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
up against
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
um ideological ethical political and
 
04:40:40.250 --> 04:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
even religious ideas that may be
 
04:40:40.260 --> 04:40:41.448 align:start position:0%
even religious ideas that may be
controversial

04:40:41.448 --> 04:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
and I know certain uh quite a lot of
 
04:40:46.010 --> 04:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
parents have spoke to me about these
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
things in schools that they don't want
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
to have their children educated on in
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
schools because they feel these are
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
values they should be inculcated on at
 
04:40:53.160 --> 04:40:54.130 align:start position:0%
values they should be inculcated on at
home

04:40:54.130 --> 04:40:54.140 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:40:58.430 --> 04:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
and finally the curriculum argument this
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
is either a local control issue where
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's not it can't be one only when we
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't like it versus you know vice versa
 
04:41:06.890 --> 04:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
and it says very clearly in the bill
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.530 --> 04:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
the discussion I guess I'm going to add
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
a few words here
 
04:41:22.448 --> 04:41:22.458 align:start position:0%
um this bill is relative to
 
04:41:24.890 --> 04:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health education in
 
04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
schools comprehensive kind of bothers me
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
here we're also getting into the realm
 
04:41:30.360 --> 04:41:31.550 align:start position:0%
here we're also getting into the realm
of

04:41:31.550 --> 04:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
saying the schools that we're going to
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
get in this domain and I don't know
 
04:41:35.868 --> 04:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
who's going to be responsible for
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
teaching it's sort of what represented
 
04:41:38.930 --> 04:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
Belcher just mentioned
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
but I also know that there's another
 
04:41:42.350 --> 04:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming forward from the
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
Senate and Senate Bill 151 which has
 
04:41:48.250 --> 04:41:48.260 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Support over in the Senate
 
04:41:51.050 --> 04:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
which does not have a financial note
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
attached to it
 
04:41:55.788 --> 04:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
so my my position on this I'd rather see
 
04:41:57.708 --> 04:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
this bill retained in this committee
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
until we have our eyeballs on 151 and we
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
can move that best Bill forward thank
 
04:42:04.200 --> 04:42:08.208 align:start position:0%
can move that best Bill forward thank
you

04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.930 --> 04:42:10.940 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I'm
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
going to support the itl motion not
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
because of the comments that
 
04:42:21.770 --> 04:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher mentioned because
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
I disagree with much of what he said
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
other than the issue that this is a
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Luna
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much Mr
 
04:42:36.360 --> 04:42:37.368 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much Mr
chair

04:42:37.368 --> 04:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh with with no disrespect to
 
04:42:43.250 --> 04:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
what represent mileage has suggested I
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
would um I I would support a retain
 
04:42:50.930 --> 04:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
um um motion on this to see that uh to
 
04:42:54.170 --> 04:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
make sure Senate Bill 151 gets over here
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
and um uh and and how that uh and how
 
04:43:00.170 --> 04:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
that reads because I think it is
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
important uh that we um that we do
 
04:43:07.850 --> 04:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
something given the um just just given
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
the situations that were that that I
 
04:43:12.410 --> 04:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
think we're facing today with uh with
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
young people and whether that means
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
having having a little bit better
 
04:43:19.250 --> 04:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
definition to what comprehensive means
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm not I'm not I guess
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
thinking that this is a um uh you know a
 
04:43:28.970 --> 04:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
mindfulness session or or or or or
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
something from a from a psychology from
 
04:43:35.570 --> 04:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
a psychotherapist or psychologist but
 
04:43:37.730 --> 04:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
something that that talks about access
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
to services and um you know services
 
04:43:42.890 --> 04:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance and and Medicaid
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
and signs to look for like what judge
 
04:43:47.330 --> 04:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
Broderick talks about uh and how we go
 
04:43:50.208 --> 04:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
about helping others to um to do that I
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
I don't see this as a as a clinical type
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
of uh uh type of thing for our students
 
04:43:59.570 --> 04:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
but something to that that like what
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with the information
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
on the back of student ID cards to just
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
give them some place a turn
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
um and um and and you know make sure
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
that our community is sensitive to to
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
helping out or or you know a you know a
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
classmate recognize that that that maybe
 
04:44:21.890 --> 04:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
they you know
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
you know need need a little bit more
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
support or access to Services that's all
 
04:44:28.368 --> 04:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking so I I think I think
 
04:44:30.530 --> 04:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd has has suggested
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a good way forward with this yes
 
04:44:34.850 --> 04:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind I like to just add a
 
04:44:34.860 --> 04:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind I like to just add a
comment

04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:44:35.760 --> 04:44:36.470 align:start position:0%
comment
um

04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
I talked to the counselor up at
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
Woodsville High School we're not a very
 
04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
big school probably about two 50 to 60
 
04:44:46.910 --> 04:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
kids approximately the counselor called
 
04:44:50.090 --> 04:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
me up and indicated we're losing the
 
04:44:52.610 --> 04:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
assistant I have in the office to work
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
with students with whether I'm providing
 
04:44:57.708 --> 04:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
information guidance or counseling the
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
counselor has the proper standards or
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
certification required to work with kids
 
04:45:06.288 --> 04:45:06.298 align:start position:0%
that have you know are are perceived as
 
04:45:09.410 --> 04:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
having some kind of a mental behavioral
 
04:45:12.410 --> 04:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
type issue whichever it may be
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
and she indicated to me she's really
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that by losing this person
 
04:45:20.810 --> 04:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
that she's had working with or under her
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
direct supervision
 
04:45:25.730 --> 04:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
that there's not going to be the
 
04:45:27.530 --> 04:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
Personnel within the building other than
 
04:45:31.610 --> 04:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
herself that's properly trained to know
 
04:45:34.190 --> 04:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
how to counsel and work with students
 
04:45:37.010 --> 04:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
that come looking for this type of help
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the past up there in Wood soil we've
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
used ammunition
 
04:45:44.930 --> 04:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
umnusic Community Mental Health
 
04:45:47.090 --> 04:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
they came into the building served that
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
purpose what's going on now though
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
zamanusic is so overloaded with people
 
04:45:54.890 --> 04:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
in the general public they can't afford
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
to let an individual come in a school
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
they don't have the Personnel either
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
so the question being does the school
 
04:46:04.368 --> 04:46:04.378 align:start position:0%
district now have the funding to hire a
 
04:46:05.930 --> 04:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
person that's going to properly do it
 
04:46:08.208 --> 04:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
they understand that we just can't let
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
anybody in this school do this because
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
the consequences could be horrible
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have the money
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
so now here we are at a position where
 
04:46:20.750 --> 04:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
we have a huge mental health issue in
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
other health impaired I mentioned in the
 
04:46:26.750 --> 04:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
IEP area is a skyrocketing
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
category within special education now
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
that deals with mental health issues
 
04:46:36.050 --> 04:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
so I for one feel that this is a
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
critical issue in our society in our
 
04:46:38.160 --> 04:46:39.110 align:start position:0%
critical issue in our society in our
schools

04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
but we better make sure that we're going
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
to do it with the proper personnel and
 
04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
is a classroom teacher was not qualified
 
04:46:49.550 --> 04:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
I don't believe many teachers are
 
04:46:54.890 --> 04:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we need to make sure
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're hiring the right people to do this
 
04:46:59.448 --> 04:46:59.458 align:start position:0%
so this this topic needs as as
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative has indicated I also
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
agree needs to be retained we need to be
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
working with the Senate right now it's
 
04:47:10.010 --> 04:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
already doing this with 151 but we also
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
need to be working with other groups
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
such as Community Mental Health and
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
finding out how we can best satisfy this
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
and accomplish it in schools
 
04:47:19.850 --> 04:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
04:47:22.368 --> 04:47:22.378 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and I would concur
 
04:47:23.930 --> 04:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
with your thinking as well as
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative lunos
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
um I have not seen SB 151 I'd like to
 
04:47:29.090 --> 04:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
see that
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I do know by by regulation mental
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
health uh as an entity is dialogue in
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
the rules and in the curriculum
 
04:47:39.170 --> 04:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
currently in the school
 
04:47:41.208 --> 04:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
um so obviously comprehensive I don't
 
04:47:43.550 --> 04:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
know what that means in this bill that
 
04:47:45.650 --> 04:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
being said I I will not support the IPL
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
but I'd much appreciate if you putting
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
our retained Motion in
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
person Damon
 
04:47:54.170 --> 04:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:47:57.410 --> 04:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the itl I would support
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the retain
 
04:48:00.650 --> 04:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
although honestly I would have preferred
 
04:48:02.030 --> 04:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
to pass it
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize that there is a
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
difference between education and therapy
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's no difference between teaching
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
students markers of depression or
 
04:48:15.410 --> 04:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
anxiety and teaching them risk factors
 
04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
for heart disease you don't make the
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
condition happen because you acknowledge
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
that these diagnoses exist
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
depression for example does not always
 
04:48:25.138 --> 04:48:26.570 align:start position:0%
depression for example does not always
present

04:48:26.570 --> 04:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
present
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
the way that people stereotypically
 
04:48:30.050 --> 04:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
would think
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
a person can superficially appear to be
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
going along just fine when in fact they
 
04:48:36.650 --> 04:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
are not very well at all
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
in their Mental Health
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
I would hope that we could retain it
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
look at the Senate bill and come out
 
04:48:45.650 --> 04:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
with something that does provide
 
04:48:48.170 --> 04:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
education on mental health conditions to
 
04:48:52.730 --> 04:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
represent dry and then represent leckers
 
04:48:56.690 --> 04:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
I'm never a fan of long lists as part of
 
04:49:06.410 --> 04:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
a mandate but is there anything that
 
04:49:09.490 --> 04:49:09.500 align:start position:0%
would preclude a school from teaching
 
04:49:11.810 --> 04:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Mental Health even if we
 
04:49:13.368 --> 04:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
don't declare it here that it needs to
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
be done
 
04:49:17.690 --> 04:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
I for one I'm not qualified to answer
 
04:49:19.010 --> 04:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
that question because I don't know
 
04:49:21.650 --> 04:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
what's meant by Comprehensive Mental
 
04:49:21.660 --> 04:49:23.448 align:start position:0%
what's meant by Comprehensive Mental
Health

04:49:23.448 --> 04:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
Health
 
04:49:26.930 --> 04:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't have an answer for that uh I
 
04:49:28.730 --> 04:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
think we're we're starting to step into
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
a domain which I'd be very careful of
 
04:49:34.550 --> 04:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
walking into with
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
why say may not be appropriate in trying
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
to help somebody and to what degree do
 
04:49:42.890 --> 04:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
how far do I go
 
04:49:42.900 --> 04:49:43.610 align:start position:0%
how far do I go
um

04:49:43.610 --> 04:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:46.310 --> 04:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you if I could
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
just clarify when I when I brought up
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
ideas of self-care and mindfulness I
 
04:49:50.690 --> 04:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
wasn't just pulling these out of The
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
Ether I did actually research what other
 
04:49:54.410 --> 04:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
states are doing under what they call
 
04:49:56.030 --> 04:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health education
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
and these are under that rubric
 
04:49:59.400 --> 04:50:03.350 align:start position:0%
and these are under that rubric
representative

04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:06.170 --> 04:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was mentioned during the
 
04:50:07.490 --> 04:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
04:50:07.500 --> 04:50:09.470 align:start position:0%
public hearing
that

04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
Mental Health on the level that
 
04:50:14.090 --> 04:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Luna was talking a basic
 
04:50:16.610 --> 04:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
this is what it is and you know places
 
04:50:19.128 --> 04:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
to go is taught in health it is part of
 
04:50:22.490 --> 04:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
the health am I not right yeah it is
 
04:50:25.490 --> 04:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
part of the health program now and so
 
04:50:28.128 --> 04:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
that's the question is what beyond that
 
04:50:30.350 --> 04:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
means comprehensive because we are being
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
taught in mental health it's part of the
 
04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
the standards or whatever that you know
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's being taught now on the level which
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
you were talking about rep luno and so
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
how much deeper do they want us to go
 
04:50:47.208 --> 04:50:47.218 align:start position:0%
that's you know representative cascadden
 
04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:50:52.128 --> 04:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
um the Ed rules 306 40 our health
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
education programs
 
04:50:57.050 --> 04:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
which also identifies
 
04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
um that the goal is to practice Health
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
enhancing behaviors and and health risk
 
04:51:04.510 --> 04:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
but there's also a specific
 
04:51:08.208 --> 04:51:08.218 align:start position:0%
identification to mental health as one
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the requirements and I think
 
04:51:12.170 --> 04:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock had pointed that
 
04:51:12.180 --> 04:51:13.550 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock had pointed that
out

04:51:13.550 --> 04:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:51:15.288 --> 04:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
and certainly we're having conversations
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
here about two extremes of the term
 
04:51:21.170 --> 04:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
mental health and I think until that's
 
04:51:23.090 --> 04:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
clarified what do you mean by mental
 
04:51:25.070 --> 04:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
health I have a mental health today does
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
it show no I hope it doesn't
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to you know you're talking
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
to a general group in school you're
 
04:51:35.330 --> 04:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
going to generalize and just make them
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
aware of some of the risk factors
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
where they could lead how they can
 
04:51:42.650 --> 04:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
intervene how they can change their
 
04:51:44.868 --> 04:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
adapt their behaviors
 
04:51:47.208 --> 04:51:47.218 align:start position:0%
whereas we don't know if that Senate
 
04:51:50.090 --> 04:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
bill is really talking about
 
04:51:50.100 --> 04:51:51.650 align:start position:0%
bill is really talking about
therapy

04:51:51.650 --> 04:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
04:51:54.610 --> 04:51:54.620 align:start position:0%
or extensive Behavioral
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
supports that are going to change
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
diagnoses behaviors that are really
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
interfering with a child's day-to-day
 
04:52:06.170 --> 04:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
function in life so the term mental
 
04:52:08.208 --> 04:52:08.218 align:start position:0%
health gets thrown out gets thrown out
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
in a field like it's
 
04:52:13.010 --> 04:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know all kinds of things but for
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
where a public school perspective
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
it is it is touched upon it is taught
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
um in a very broad sense it does not
 
04:52:24.050 --> 04:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
deal with the health teacher does not
 
04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
provide individual therapy by any means
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
and guidance counselor would not provide
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
any therapy either unless they're highly
 
04:52:31.680 --> 04:52:32.750 align:start position:0%
any therapy either unless they're highly
trained

04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
trained
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I think that information needs to be
 
04:52:38.448 --> 04:52:38.458 align:start position:0%
vetted out like I think you said that's
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
what we had uh when we looked at 306 and
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
we added in Wellness topics and such
 
04:52:46.250 --> 04:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
that which are there in 306 yeah
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
um you're correct these are not getting
 
04:52:51.770 --> 04:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know how far this is getting
 
04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
down into the weeds right right here uh
 
04:52:57.050 --> 04:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
I know how we've been functioning and
 
04:53:00.050 --> 04:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
the counselor up at Woods will explain
 
04:53:02.090 --> 04:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
that to me
 
04:53:04.250 --> 04:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and there's many schools that are
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
having even a specialist when they delve
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
into this type of instruction I have
 
04:53:11.390 --> 04:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
time you use times used my nurse who at
 
04:53:13.250 --> 04:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
that time had a four-year degree plus a
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
masters right and had a very good
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
understanding and had training in that
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
area but it's a rare find to find a
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
nurse like that for a school or even a
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
counselor so yeah and I think
 
04:53:29.810 --> 04:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
um after we had a presenter the other
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
day I mean a lot of our schools in the
 
04:53:34.550 --> 04:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
North Country actually required all of
 
04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
our staff to be trained in youth mental
 
04:53:39.050 --> 04:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
health first grade first aid so that the
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
regular ed teacher would know those
 
04:53:44.810 --> 04:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
signs to be able to seek out assistance
 
04:53:47.570 --> 04:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
04:53:50.448 --> 04:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cordelli
 
04:53:52.368 --> 04:53:52.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:53:55.788 --> 04:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note says that districts
 
04:53:57.890 --> 04:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
might experience new cost in purchasing
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum we've had several bills
 
04:54:05.090 --> 04:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
um communism civil rights Etc that were
 
04:54:07.550 --> 04:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
not passed because we don't get involved
 
04:54:09.530 --> 04:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
in curriculum but here we're getting
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
involved in curriculum but are we
 
04:54:13.490 --> 04:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
getting involved with the curriculum
 
04:54:13.500 --> 04:54:14.810 align:start position:0%
getting involved with the curriculum
because

04:54:14.810 --> 04:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
um of the name of the subject matter
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
um I I think I think we need some
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:54:29.570 --> 04:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so so to that to that point
 
04:54:34.850 --> 04:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I mean this is a
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
modification of an existing statute
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's specifically directed towards
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
health education physical education and
 
04:54:45.650 --> 04:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
I think it's in a part of the law where
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
um where it's somewhat by what is it
 
04:54:49.850 --> 04:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
called is is this the one that's under
 
04:54:53.868 --> 04:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
studies yes yeah so and it's an area
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that I think the um
 
04:54:59.868 --> 04:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
um the legislative budget assistant has
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
suggested could could actually be be
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
worked on a little bit more you know
 
04:55:09.288 --> 04:55:09.298 align:start position:0%
right now I think it it is it's um you
 
04:55:11.690 --> 04:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
know generally focused in um in the
 
04:55:15.250 --> 04:55:15.260 align:start position:0%
wellness area and um and
 
04:55:17.530 --> 04:55:17.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm
 
04:55:20.448 --> 04:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
not you know again I'm not I'm not
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting an ought to pass it at this
 
04:55:27.410 --> 04:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
point very excited to see 151
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
um make it over here however I still
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
think it I think it's still in committee
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
um in the Senate come on docket
 
04:55:36.480 --> 04:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
um in the Senate come on docket
um

04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:40.250 --> 04:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
and uh and this gives us you know at
 
04:55:42.410 --> 04:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
least a vehicle that I think could be um
 
04:55:45.230 --> 04:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know you know could be used should
 
04:55:47.090 --> 04:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason that stall out
 
04:55:48.530 --> 04:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere yeah
 
04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cordiallo
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
so representative cascadden had just
 
04:55:54.890 --> 04:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned about
 
04:55:56.990 --> 04:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
um training teachers and
 
04:55:58.730 --> 04:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
youth mental health I don't know is that
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
and and to me that's
 
04:56:04.128 --> 04:56:04.138 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing I don't believe
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
a class of curriculum
 
04:56:09.650 --> 04:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
for the students if the overall issue is
 
04:56:09.660 --> 04:56:11.570 align:start position:0%
for the students if the overall issue is
to

04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:56:14.208 --> 04:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
um help with the Mental Health crisis I
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
believe teachers should be more
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
aware of the students and and exhibiting
 
04:56:24.010 --> 04:56:24.020 align:start position:0%
symptoms of mental illness
 
04:56:27.530 --> 04:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
so I am concerned about the class
 
04:56:27.540 --> 04:56:28.850 align:start position:0%
so I am concerned about the class
teaching

04:56:28.850 --> 04:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to get that out there
 
04:56:33.530 --> 04:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
that I think I appreciate
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
this the issue and that this is the
 
04:56:38.330 --> 04:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
problem the mental health issue it's a
 
04:56:40.010 --> 04:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
me it's a matter of how do we address it
 
04:56:41.810 --> 04:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's more about having the
 
04:56:44.448 --> 04:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
teachers better trained
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:56:46.320 --> 04:56:48.170 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
cascadden

04:56:48.170 --> 04:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
cascadden
 
04:56:50.570 --> 04:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
um just to add I I don't see this as a
 
04:56:52.250 --> 04:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
curriculum I wouldn't want to buy a
 
04:56:54.368 --> 04:56:54.378 align:start position:0%
curriculum in this field that's not our
 
04:56:54.378 --> 04:56:56.050 align:start position:0%
curriculum in this field that's not our
expertise

04:56:56.050 --> 04:56:56.060 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
for sure

it right there
 
05:00:55.010 --> 05:00:55.020 align:start position:0%

Jefferson Lexus

you think this is something that the

committee as a whole needs to work on
 
05:01:14.400 --> 05:01:15.288 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole needs to work on
um

05:01:15.288 --> 05:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:18.490 --> 05:01:18.500 align:start position:0%
there seems to be agreement in needing
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
accountability but there seems to be
 
05:01:23.448 --> 05:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
disagreement in how it's done I had
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
hoped that by putting in
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
the wording from the Democrat Bill last
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
year that there would be more support
 
05:01:35.570 --> 05:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
um apparently that is not the case so I
 
05:01:37.250 --> 05:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
would like to work on this
 
05:01:39.050 --> 05:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
actually work on this and have
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and whatever and see if we
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
can as a committee come up with
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
something that we all agree is
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate accountability
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:53.570 --> 05:01:53.580 align:start position:0%

05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um K-12 schools are exempt under our
 
05:04:47.570 --> 05:04:47.580 align:start position:0%

education remains
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
I think we had a lot of testimony about
 
05:05:05.930 --> 05:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
things that have been found by parents
 
05:05:07.390 --> 05:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a process where
 
05:05:13.368 --> 05:05:13.378 align:start position:0%
parents can object to that
 
05:05:13.378 --> 05:05:14.170 align:start position:0%
parents can object to that
um

05:05:14.170 --> 05:05:14.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
some of the examples that were brought
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%

05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
terms of printed materials and in terms
 
05:05:28.128 --> 05:05:28.138 align:start position:0%

many of our schools on school property
 
05:05:42.350 --> 05:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
I I think that this is an issue not just
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but Nationwide and I
 
05:05:47.650 --> 05:05:47.660 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
05:05:51.890 --> 05:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
removing K-12 from the exemption will
 
05:05:54.730 --> 05:05:54.740 align:start position:0%
help move things in a better direction
 
05:05:58.550 --> 05:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
for our children and our families in New
 
05:05:58.560 --> 05:06:01.128 align:start position:0%
for our children and our families in New
Hampshire

further discussion representative
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair uh I would
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
just add to that that the nature of the
 
05:06:08.750 --> 05:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
materials that we're talking about I've
 
05:06:10.970 --> 05:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
seen quite a bit of it myself is uh
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
unpleasant to look at it's the sort of
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
material that you will not find in most
 
05:06:19.310 --> 05:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
in most search engines on the internet
 
05:06:22.930 --> 05:06:22.940 align:start position:0%
unless you turn off the safe filter
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of stuff we're getting
 
05:06:24.958 --> 05:06:26.570 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of stuff we're getting
into

05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I have had I cannot tell you how many
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
complaints from parents that this kind
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
of material is accessible
 
05:06:37.610 --> 05:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I have had conversations with
 
05:06:37.620 --> 05:06:39.590 align:start position:0%
um I have had conversations with
librarians

05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
librarians
 
05:06:41.868 --> 05:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
um some of them cannot believe that this
 
05:06:44.330 --> 05:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
material is allowed to be accessible in
 
05:06:44.340 --> 05:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
material is allowed to be accessible in
schools

05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I am strongly for this Bill thank you
 
05:06:52.010 --> 05:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
chair I was speaking the other day with
 
05:06:58.490 --> 05:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
a concerned parent from Dover and they
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
were telling me that a member at their
 
05:07:04.368 --> 05:07:04.378 align:start position:0%
school board or their friend they posted
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
pictures of a children's book online to
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
a Facebook group in Dover and Facebook
 
05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
took the photos down because they were
 
05:07:11.218 --> 05:07:12.350 align:start position:0%
took the photos down because they were
obscene

05:07:12.350 --> 05:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
obscene
 
05:07:14.930 --> 05:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand why this is even
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
a question why this should be in our
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
schools passing this bill would give
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
rights to parents to if they found
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
something obscene a measure and a course
 
05:07:24.170 --> 05:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
of action for them to take to protect
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
their children it just seems obvious and
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:07:34.368 --> 05:07:34.378 align:start position:0%
uh represent Cascade and then we'll come
 
05:07:35.930 --> 05:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
over to the second
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:07:40.010 --> 05:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
I think you heard testimony I mean there
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
is an ideology going across the country
 
05:07:42.360 --> 05:07:43.610 align:start position:0%
is an ideology going across the country
to

05:07:43.610 --> 05:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
quote banned books and I know this is
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
not supposedly what this is
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
but I think by passing such a rule for
 
05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
public schools K to 12 you're infringing
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
on my rights for my kids to learn
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
resilience and to be exposed to good
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
literature I think as a parent if I
 
05:08:04.850 --> 05:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
didn't like something your local school
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
board has a policy ige or somewhere in
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
the eyes
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
that allows you to object to that
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
material and then stop your child from
 
05:08:18.288 --> 05:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
participating in that piece of material
 
05:08:20.930 --> 05:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
you also are your child's first teacher
 
05:08:24.050 --> 05:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
to teach them what's good internet use
 
05:08:26.570 --> 05:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
and what's bad internet use
 
05:08:28.730 --> 05:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'm getting sick and tired of always
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
dumping on the public schools because
 
05:08:32.930 --> 05:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
they don't do this that and the other
 
05:08:35.150 --> 05:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
thing but yet
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
the support is not there to do
 
05:08:37.440 --> 05:08:38.990 align:start position:0%
the support is not there to do
everything

05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:08:40.850 --> 05:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
I mean we're expected to be social
 
05:08:43.730 --> 05:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
service agencies mental health clinics
 
05:08:46.610 --> 05:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
vaccine you name it
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
but yet anything that's done to support
 
05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
kids in the General Public
 
05:08:53.930 --> 05:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
is never good enough well let me tell
 
05:08:56.448 --> 05:08:56.458 align:start position:0%
you somebody said it the other day New
 
05:08:58.670 --> 05:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public schools are in the top
 
05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
five in the country
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
and we have rigorous standards in our
 
05:09:04.670 --> 05:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
public schools and our kids are
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
successful for the most part I don't
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
care what school you're going to go to
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
private home school you're always going
 
05:09:14.930 --> 05:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
to have a gamut of high Achievers and
 
05:09:16.550 --> 05:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
low achievers
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
and public schools are designed to try
 
05:09:23.930 --> 05:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of the General Public
 
05:09:26.270 --> 05:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's the extremes sometimes
 
05:09:27.770 --> 05:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:09:31.128 --> 05:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
but we are dealing with kids here and we
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
have to juggle all kinds of things to
 
05:09:35.690 --> 05:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
try to meet their needs
 
05:09:39.368 --> 05:09:39.378 align:start position:0%
so I cannot support this type of a bill
 
05:09:42.110 --> 05:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to satisfy a handful of
 
05:09:43.970 --> 05:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
parents who don't like a certain book
 
05:09:46.970 --> 05:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
then be a parent and say no my kid is
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
not going to participate in that
 
05:09:51.530 --> 05:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
and follow the school board policy on
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
how a parent should object because they
 
05:09:57.288 --> 05:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
have that right your child does not have
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
to read that book you have that parent
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
right but you don't have the right for
 
05:10:06.650 --> 05:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
the 50 other kids
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
that are going to learn something about
 
05:10:12.050 --> 05:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
resilience and society as a whole so
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
that as adults they can make critical
 
05:10:18.550 --> 05:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
decisions and be productive citizens
 
05:10:22.368 --> 05:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
sorry that's it okay uh represent
 
05:10:22.378 --> 05:10:25.070 align:start position:0%
sorry that's it okay uh represent
electus

05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.530 --> 05:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
and look at that material I still cannot
 
05:10:30.170 --> 05:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
get those pictures out of my mind and I
 
05:10:32.990 --> 05:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
cannot believe that we want
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
our young children to be looking at
 
05:10:38.090 --> 05:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
those pictures which happens before the
 
05:10:41.208 --> 05:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
parent even finds out about it the harm
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
is done and I know when I went to school
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
the library invented the school
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
librarian vetted everything and we had
 
05:10:51.770 --> 05:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
sections that were age appropriate we're
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
not talking about banning books we're
 
05:10:55.730 --> 05:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
talking about having age-appropriate
 
05:10:58.990 --> 05:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
material and some of that absolutely
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
disgusting obscene
 
05:11:02.280 --> 05:11:04.730 align:start position:0%
disgusting obscene
um

05:11:04.730 --> 05:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:07.368 --> 05:11:07.378 align:start position:0%
pictures that were in those books that
 
05:11:10.970 --> 05:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
are in elementary schools is is
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
I almost despair of our culture at this
 
05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
point if this is considered okay
 
05:11:19.788 --> 05:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
to you know and you can't you can't wipe
 
05:11:22.368 --> 05:11:22.378 align:start position:0%
those pictures out of your mind
 
05:11:26.208 --> 05:11:26.218 align:start position:0%
it just I'm appalled at any rate that's
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
my comment
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
going down here to represent Damon then
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
05:11:34.250 --> 05:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
the research clearly shows that the
 
05:11:39.050 --> 05:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
majority of book titles that are
 
05:11:40.730 --> 05:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
targeted for Banning
 
05:11:45.410 --> 05:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
are by or about people or not Caucasian
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
skin color or are lgbtq
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is a book a bill
 
05:11:52.368 --> 05:11:52.378 align:start position:0%
about protecting our children
 
05:11:55.010 --> 05:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
I think it's a book about by a bill
 
05:11:57.770 --> 05:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
about bias and I'm vigorously opposed to
 
05:11:57.780 --> 05:12:00.788 align:start position:0%
about bias and I'm vigorously opposed to
it

05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:02.930 --> 05:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to make a
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
quick point that I think
 
05:12:08.230 --> 05:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
um is incredibly important here
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
this this bill is not actually crafting
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
a new law
 
05:12:15.890 --> 05:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's just making a minor modification to
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
a law that's already on the books and
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
the point of me bringing that up is
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
if a person were to approach a child on
 
05:12:26.810 --> 05:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
a playground and show them the pictures
 
05:12:28.850 --> 05:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
in one of these books the police would
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
come up put them in handcuffs and take
 
05:12:32.690 --> 05:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
them to jail because that's already this
 
05:12:34.670 --> 05:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's already the law because it's
 
05:12:36.288 --> 05:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
obscene material and it's being pushed
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
on kids what we're saying here is that
 
05:12:42.530 --> 05:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
we need to remove the exemption
 
05:12:45.530 --> 05:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
that exists for whatever reason in K
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
through 12. it doesn't apply to colleges
 
05:12:49.610 --> 05:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
they have full academic freedom
 
05:12:51.770 --> 05:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
this is already a law we're just
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
removing the exemption for K to 12.
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:02.160 --> 05:13:03.050 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:13:03.050 --> 05:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that surprised me the
 
05:13:05.160 --> 05:13:07.070 align:start position:0%
one of the things that surprised me the
most

05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
most
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
is that I've been approached by parents
 
05:13:10.798 --> 05:13:12.470 align:start position:0%
is that I've been approached by parents
who

05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
really want to protect their kids they
 
05:13:17.448 --> 05:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
may have gone to the school about some
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
of this material the material is
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
available not necessarily just in the
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
classroom or part of the curriculum it's
 
05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the library so I'm not quite sure how
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
you would opt out would you send a list
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
of books that you didn't want your child
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
to check out and how would a librarian
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
possibly be able to keep track of the
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
number of books that I may or may not
 
05:13:46.570 --> 05:13:46.580 align:start position:0%
want my child to read I think that's
 
05:13:50.810 --> 05:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
unbelievably burdensome and
 
05:13:53.810 --> 05:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill gives those
 
05:13:55.970 --> 05:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
parents who feel like they've gone to
 
05:13:57.890 --> 05:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
the school gone to the school board
 
05:14:00.410 --> 05:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
taken the proper channels and still not
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
been heard
 
05:14:01.920 --> 05:14:03.708 align:start position:0%
been heard
to

05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
have a law that has some teeth in it
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
that they can utilize so they don't feel
 
05:14:11.690 --> 05:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
powerless anymore about when it comes to
 
05:14:14.510 --> 05:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
protecting their children
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a policy in place in
 
05:14:24.288 --> 05:14:24.298 align:start position:0%
Bedford for a parent to go through the
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
process of removing a book and we had a
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
mom that did this uh last year
 
05:14:31.680 --> 05:14:33.470 align:start position:0%
mom that did this uh last year
um

05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:35.570 --> 05:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
it didn't result in the book being
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
removed but she was trying to let other
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
parents know what was happening in their
 
05:14:43.970 --> 05:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
school libraries by writing letters to
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
the editor in our local paper
 
05:14:49.550 --> 05:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
and she was taking direct quotes from
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
the books and
 
05:14:51.840 --> 05:14:52.550 align:start position:0%
the books and
um

05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:55.368 --> 05:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
the paper told her that they could no
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
longer publish her letters unless she
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
were to summarize and not use a direct
 
05:15:04.610 --> 05:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
quote because it was too graphic so I
 
05:15:05.590 --> 05:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
why something like this is appropriate
 
05:15:12.770 --> 05:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
in K through 12 and it's not appropriate
 
05:15:16.670 --> 05:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
for adults to read in their local paper
 
05:15:16.680 --> 05:15:19.030 align:start position:0%
for adults to read in their local paper
foreign

05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:15:21.770 --> 05:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
05:15:23.930 --> 05:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
a couple of things I'm not sure what
 
05:15:28.128 --> 05:15:28.138 align:start position:0%
ideology is at work
 
05:15:31.730 --> 05:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
um with my submission of this bill
 
05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
um the intent as we heard we have to
 
05:15:37.310 --> 05:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
support kids well that's that's the
 
05:15:40.250 --> 05:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill I didn't put this
 
05:15:43.368 --> 05:15:43.378 align:start position:0%
bill in in relation to any bias and I
 
05:15:46.128 --> 05:15:46.138 align:start position:0%
resent that implication that there was a
 
05:15:49.610 --> 05:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
bias involved in submitting this bill
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
05:15:54.410 --> 05:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
parents objections
 
05:15:57.170 --> 05:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
their apps on school property on
 
05:16:00.350 --> 05:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks issued by the school
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
obscene materials on that that's being
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
handed out to kids by schools how the
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
parents is the parent going to go
 
05:16:12.288 --> 05:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
through the entire app looking for
 
05:16:14.810 --> 05:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
something looking for pictures
 
05:16:17.628 --> 05:16:17.638 align:start position:0%
um uh I've heard from a parent
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
um there is a
 
05:16:23.448 --> 05:16:23.458 align:start position:0%
um an objectional book in their opinion
 
05:16:25.448 --> 05:16:25.458 align:start position:0%
um related to
 
05:16:29.090 --> 05:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
homosexuality and it has a link so the
 
05:16:31.970 --> 05:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
student can email the author of the book
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
we're putting students in touch with
 
05:16:36.830 --> 05:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
someone who might not have their best
 
05:16:39.530 --> 05:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
interest at heart how can we do that
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
to as was stated remove the exemption
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
for K-12 education to protect our kids
 
05:16:53.690 --> 05:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
not it's not about banning books it's
 
05:16:57.050 --> 05:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
about protecting our kids thank you
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative luno

thank you Mr chip what was the um the
 
05:17:04.490 --> 05:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
book that was that the parent that the
 
05:17:07.070 --> 05:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
parent was trying to uh pull from
 
05:17:07.080 --> 05:17:11.590 align:start position:0%
parent was trying to uh pull from
Bedford

05:17:11.590 --> 05:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.490 --> 05:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
oh gosh
 
05:17:13.500 --> 05:17:14.750 align:start position:0%
oh gosh
um

05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:17.690 --> 05:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
there was a fee there was a few and I I
 
05:17:20.208 --> 05:17:20.218 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can say it specifically
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
like was it nickel and dimed no no no no
 
05:17:26.090 --> 05:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's what I saw pulled up in Bedford
 
05:17:27.470 --> 05:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that happened many years
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
ago okay so parents are trying to pull
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
books off shelves and like I'm not sure
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
exactly which one it was so I don't want
 
05:17:38.510 --> 05:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
to put it out there I mean it I could
 
05:17:41.330 --> 05:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
put it could have been Lawn Boy because
 
05:17:43.250 --> 05:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
I know that that had come up at one
 
05:17:46.910 --> 05:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
point yeah nickel and dimed is
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
yeah that is not the one that I'm
 
05:17:51.050 --> 05:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
talking about right that was that was
 
05:17:53.990 --> 05:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
tried on the Bedford policy yes many
 
05:17:59.090 --> 05:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to add one more thing to
 
05:18:03.770 --> 05:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
my story
 
05:18:06.590 --> 05:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
um the the mom that went through this
 
05:18:08.810 --> 05:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
process they ended up pulling their kids
 
05:18:10.730 --> 05:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
out of the public school
 
05:18:12.368 --> 05:18:12.378 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
this really creates a trust problem
 
05:18:17.208 --> 05:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
which is already an issue with Public
 
05:18:19.610 --> 05:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
Schools right now with parents and I
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
just think that this erodes it even
 
05:18:23.868 --> 05:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
further the more people learn about
 
05:18:29.330 --> 05:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:29.340 --> 05:18:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
woodcock

05:18:31.310 --> 05:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
05:18:32.810 --> 05:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
05:18:32.820 --> 05:18:34.190 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:35.570 --> 05:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'd agree with many of the things that
 
05:18:39.170 --> 05:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
that uh Dr Cascade indicated earlier
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
when I said we'll go over the fact that
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
parents can have the option to pull out
 
05:18:45.650 --> 05:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
but parents can tell the library and
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'll put it out and the parents
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for what their children
 
05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
are doing they could parents could train
 
05:18:53.930 --> 05:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
children to be clear what they can or
 
05:18:55.970 --> 05:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
cannot read I won't mention that but
 
05:19:00.050 --> 05:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
what I will mentioned is uh part three
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
and part four having been in that
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
capacity uh on page two they said the
 
05:19:08.510 --> 05:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
school principal or his designee shall
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
determine what material is subject to
 
05:19:12.410 --> 05:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
complaint if it's harmful to minus the
 
05:19:14.930 --> 05:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
school principal shall determine uh it
 
05:19:17.868 --> 05:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
should be removed or restricted
 
05:19:20.810 --> 05:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
why should I have the ability when in
 
05:19:23.448 --> 05:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
that capacity to tell one parent what's
 
05:19:25.368 --> 05:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
good for one not go to the other
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
I think this I think that I I do think
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more in this bill than
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
just uh the the concern about
 
05:19:34.368 --> 05:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
pornographic materials that shouldn't be
 
05:19:35.810 --> 05:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
in children's hands I have no problem
 
05:19:37.368 --> 05:19:37.378 align:start position:0%
with photography Heroes not being should
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
of hands absolutely all right and I I
 
05:19:41.090 --> 05:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
personally didn't look at the picture
 
05:19:42.770 --> 05:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
that was passed up the other day but
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
that being said I have a real concern
 
05:19:47.810 --> 05:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
about one person the school principal
 
05:19:49.490 --> 05:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to decide what's good and
 
05:19:51.170 --> 05:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
what's bad
 
05:19:52.490 --> 05:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
and that's the way this is written under
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
the new section of the law on the stops
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
over in line 24 on page one so I think
 
05:19:59.868 --> 05:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
this this bill has has a host of things
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
that one parent shouldn't decide and one
 
05:20:04.610 --> 05:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
school principal surely shouldn't decide
 
05:20:07.128 --> 05:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
and as I asked at the hearing the other
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
day from the the library specialist
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
about if it was banned in plasto and
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's okay in Pittsburgh you abandoned
 
05:20:17.570 --> 05:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
Bedford and okay in Conway there this is
 
05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is a a way out a way out of
 
05:20:22.128 --> 05:20:22.138 align:start position:0%
fairness to the state and I I don't
 
05:20:23.570 --> 05:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
think we should let any one person
 
05:20:26.448 --> 05:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
decide what is what is fair for students
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh in particular the building principle
 
05:20:29.750 --> 05:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
having sat in that chair
 
05:20:31.250 --> 05:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:34.010 --> 05:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Allison oh
 
05:20:37.490 --> 05:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh simply support uh
 
05:20:39.650 --> 05:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
Representatives kiss haddon's position
 
05:20:44.330 --> 05:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
that uh as a parent I have the right to
 
05:20:46.610 --> 05:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
determine what my child learns in school
 
05:20:50.270 --> 05:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
what books they use and as far as I know
 
05:20:52.250 --> 05:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
most school districts have a process in
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
which you can do that what I object to
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
you is someone else telling me what my
 
05:20:59.810 --> 05:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
kids can and cannot read
 
05:21:02.448 --> 05:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
you have that right for your own kid you
 
05:21:04.850 --> 05:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
do not have that right for my kid and
 
05:21:07.430 --> 05:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
for everyone else is there I will also
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
simply just note the definition of
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
obesity from Justice Potter which is I
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
know it when I see it
 
05:21:22.010 --> 05:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
and I I frankly I I do not want to have
 
05:21:26.270 --> 05:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
our policies at the mercy of a whole
 
05:21:29.090 --> 05:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
group of people who or a single person
 
05:21:31.610 --> 05:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
who looks at something which may be
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
innocuous to everyone else but they
 
05:21:35.570 --> 05:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
think it's obscene and that becomes the
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
basis for their complaint uh that that's
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
a real slippery slope when we get to
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
that point
 
05:21:43.730 --> 05:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:43.740 --> 05:21:45.288 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to just expand on
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's comments after
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
the school principal or designee has a
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
decision regardless of which way it goes
 
05:22:03.288 --> 05:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
there's a response for a repeal an
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
appeal that goes to the school board and
 
05:22:08.690 --> 05:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
if there is still a response from uh if
 
05:22:10.010 --> 05:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
a school board decision is not
 
05:22:13.730 --> 05:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
acceptable either party can go to the
 
05:22:15.650 --> 05:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so it's not just
 
05:22:18.530 --> 05:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
one person's decision yes at one point
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
it is but then there is a large appeal
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
process and I just would ask you to look
 
05:22:27.288 --> 05:22:27.298 align:start position:0%
at the RSA 650 the about about obscene
 
05:22:29.690 --> 05:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
matter and just look at the definition
 
05:22:32.690 --> 05:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
of obscene matter I mean it is almost
 
05:22:34.850 --> 05:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
you will know it when you see it because
 
05:22:38.090 --> 05:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
it is explicitly uh described there and
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
I think if you look at that definition
 
05:22:41.570 --> 05:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
you would agree that there would
 
05:22:44.030 --> 05:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
probably you would want if you were a
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
parent not just your child to not be
 
05:22:48.650 --> 05:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
able to have access to it but really to
 
05:22:50.570 --> 05:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
keep it out of other children's hands
 
05:22:54.250 --> 05:22:54.260 align:start position:0%
because it would have been ruled obscene
 
05:22:57.410 --> 05:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
Belcher just to speak to a couple points
 
05:22:58.490 --> 05:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
I've heard
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
um I don't think anybody's suggesting
 
05:23:03.770 --> 05:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
removing content from public libraries
 
05:23:06.650 --> 05:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
here nobody's suggesting you can't go on
 
05:23:10.010 --> 05:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
Amazon and buy a book or get a Kindle
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
e-reader for your home we're talking
 
05:23:14.570 --> 05:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
about what's available to children in
 
05:23:16.730 --> 05:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
general in public schools and I think
 
05:23:18.050 --> 05:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
public important is important here
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
because public is another name for a
 
05:23:22.250 --> 05:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
school that is run with government money
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
using government employees in government
 
05:23:27.650 --> 05:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
just to be very clear this is scotus
 
05:23:30.050 --> 05:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
opinion government does not have free
 
05:23:34.490 --> 05:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
speech the people have free speech the
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
people are free to limit the
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
government's speech including obscene
 
05:23:38.760 --> 05:23:40.368 align:start position:0%
government's speech including obscene
materials

05:23:40.368 --> 05:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
materials
 
05:23:42.350 --> 05:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
they may not limit each other's speech
 
05:23:44.208 --> 05:23:44.218 align:start position:0%
they have no right to come into your
 
05:23:44.218 --> 05:23:45.288 align:start position:0%
they have no right to come into your
home

05:23:45.288 --> 05:23:45.298 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
but they do have a right to regulate
 
05:23:49.250 --> 05:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
their own government because this is a
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
government of buy and for the people
 
05:23:55.128 --> 05:23:55.138 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you thank you Mr chair
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to correct the record by first
 
05:24:02.990 --> 05:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
saying no one here is Banning books this
 
05:24:05.330 --> 05:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
bill does not ban books the intention of
 
05:24:07.610 --> 05:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
this is not to ban books I can't
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
underscore that enough the intention is
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
simply to make things grade level
 
05:24:12.958 --> 05:24:14.690 align:start position:0%
simply to make things grade level
appropriate

05:24:14.690 --> 05:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:24:17.628 --> 05:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
and furthermore since I am certain that
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
this is not Banning books we
 
05:24:22.368 --> 05:24:22.378 align:start position:0%
collectively can be asserting that the
 
05:24:24.170 --> 05:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill is not to
 
05:24:26.030 --> 05:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
discriminate against any ethnic or
 
05:24:28.128 --> 05:24:28.138 align:start position:0%
racial group as representative daming
 
05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
noted might be the case because we are
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
not Banning books of any racial or
 
05:24:34.190 --> 05:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
ethnic group because we're not Banning
 
05:24:38.628 --> 05:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:44.708 --> 05:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:24:49.730 --> 05:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
HP 514 is a very slippery slope
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
if it's not this now it would be that
 
05:24:52.440 --> 05:24:53.948 align:start position:0%
if it's not this now it would be that
then

05:24:53.948 --> 05:24:53.958 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:24:56.810 --> 05:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
it's in the eye of the beholder
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
no one I would assume I can pretty sure
 
05:25:03.230 --> 05:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
say that in this body right here nobody
 
05:25:05.868 --> 05:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
wants a child to be harmed by a
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
particular book or a particular picture
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
but I think it does
 
05:25:13.490 --> 05:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
it is incumbent upon the parents
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
to deal with the school district and
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's a local decision on the school
 
05:25:19.368 --> 05:25:19.378 align:start position:0%
district to make a decision on which
 
05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
book is age appropriate Etc
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
I mean those those policies are already
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
in place
 
05:25:27.770 --> 05:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
and I'll speak personally about a book
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned just a minute ago
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
this goes back to Slippery Slope
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
question I've read The Lawn Boy
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
I made sure my grandkids read the long
 
05:25:36.718 --> 05:25:37.550 align:start position:0%
I made sure my grandkids read the long
boy

05:25:37.550 --> 05:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
boy
 
05:25:40.128 --> 05:25:40.138 align:start position:0%
we talked about the concepts in the Lawn
 
05:25:42.350 --> 05:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
Boy as a teaching moment
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
now that was fine for me
 
05:25:47.150 --> 05:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
but for some other parent they may not
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
want their child to read the long boy
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
and that's perfectly okay my point is
 
05:25:55.970 --> 05:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
is that we cannot be we cannot make
 
05:25:55.980 --> 05:25:57.350 align:start position:0%
is that we cannot be we cannot make
decisions

05:25:57.350 --> 05:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
05:26:00.170 --> 05:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
on something this important for for kids
 
05:26:02.330 --> 05:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
and for parents in dealing with their
 
05:26:03.650 --> 05:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
children on what they're going to learn
 
05:26:06.110 --> 05:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
and how they're going to learn it and I
 
05:26:08.810 --> 05:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
think this goes Way Beyond what's needed
 
05:26:10.310 --> 05:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
at this point in time because I think
 
05:26:11.930 --> 05:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
there are policies already in place
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
there are due process issues that are
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
already in school districts where
 
05:26:18.650 --> 05:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
parents can challenge the uh the
 
05:26:22.368 --> 05:26:22.378 align:start position:0%
Brokenness of a particular article Etc I
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't do not think that this is
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
necessary I think it goes Way Beyond
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
what we have right now thank you
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:26:31.730 --> 05:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
I haven't weighed in on anything at this
 
05:26:34.250 --> 05:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
point in time but I I do have a couple
 
05:26:37.310 --> 05:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
more like technical type questions here
 
05:26:41.448 --> 05:26:41.458 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to look at line six
 
05:26:45.050 --> 05:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
no recognized or established institution
 
05:26:47.208 --> 05:26:47.218 align:start position:0%
in the University system or the
 
05:26:48.650 --> 05:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
05:26:48.660 --> 05:26:50.090 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
Hampshire

05:26:50.090 --> 05:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:26:52.788 --> 05:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
and I know I do know for a fact that we
 
05:26:55.070 --> 05:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
have certain classes taught at the
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
University Systems in the area of
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice
 
05:27:01.788 --> 05:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
and cyber security
 
05:27:04.610 --> 05:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
which these types of obscene materials
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
are used as you know as used in the
 
05:27:11.330 --> 05:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
instructional teaching process
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
but is it possible the way this bill is
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
written now that this will be seen as an
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
obscene matter
 
05:27:19.850 --> 05:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
and the there could be a possible
 
05:27:21.770 --> 05:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
hearing as a result of using these
 
05:27:26.090 --> 05:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.650 --> 05:27:29.660 align:start position:0%
that line that you're talking about no
 
05:27:31.970 --> 05:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
recognized or established institution in
 
05:27:33.770 --> 05:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
the united University system or
 
05:27:35.930 --> 05:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
chromology system Museum public library
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
or governmental agency
 
05:27:40.850 --> 05:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
Etc shall be arrested charged or
 
05:27:42.650 --> 05:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
indicted for any violation of a
 
05:27:45.050 --> 05:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
provision of this chapter they're being
 
05:27:48.110 --> 05:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
Exempted from this chapter so no we are
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
not going to be doing anything to them
 
05:27:51.770 --> 05:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
read that sentence all it says until
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
such time read the rest of it till such
 
05:27:57.230 --> 05:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
time as the material involved has been
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
first been the subject as an adversary
 
05:28:02.150 --> 05:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
hearing where in such institution or
 
05:28:05.208 --> 05:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
person is made a defendant and after
 
05:28:07.730 --> 05:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
such material is declared by the court
 
05:28:10.970 --> 05:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
to be obscene matter such institution or
 
05:28:12.770 --> 05:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
person continues to engage in the
 
05:28:15.770 --> 05:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
contact conduct prohibited by this
 
05:28:17.570 --> 05:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
chapter the sole issue with the hearing
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
shall be whether and that gets then
 
05:28:21.890 --> 05:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
covered under no the last sentence the
 
05:28:23.628 --> 05:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
sole issue at the hearing shall be
 
05:28:26.030 --> 05:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
whether the material is obscene material
 
05:28:28.190 --> 05:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I said because that comes
 
05:28:30.788 --> 05:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
under title
 
05:28:34.550 --> 05:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
62. yeah represent Belcher thank you Mr
 
05:28:36.530 --> 05:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
chair actually if if instead of looking
 
05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
at that you look at lines one and the
 
05:28:40.990 --> 05:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
following line
 
05:28:43.788 --> 05:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
justifile justifiable and non-commercial
 
05:28:45.948 --> 05:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
private dissemination if you were then
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
to go over to RSA 6 650 uh colon 4 and
 
05:28:52.550 --> 05:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
read that you'll find that the modified
 
05:28:55.730 --> 05:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
sentence here is actually a affirmative
 
05:28:58.430 --> 05:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
defense against any sort of hearings or
 
05:29:00.770 --> 05:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
prosecution under this article so that
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
any higher education is absolutely
 
05:29:02.878 --> 05:29:04.128 align:start position:0%
any higher education is absolutely
Exempted

05:29:04.128 --> 05:29:04.138 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
05:29:06.890 --> 05:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
is what is is totally Exempted from this
 
05:29:09.890 --> 05:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
and look at the next section
 
05:29:12.530 --> 05:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
you you actually have to go over to 650
 
05:29:15.288 --> 05:29:15.298 align:start position:0%
colon 4 to read how the next sentence
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
modifies that one sentence in that in
 
05:29:21.410 --> 05:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
that law under justifiable affirmative
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh defense
 
05:29:26.690 --> 05:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
It also says that the it may only be
 
05:29:28.970 --> 05:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
initiated by the County Attorney the
 
05:29:30.890 --> 05:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
County Attorney General the Department
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services or the
 
05:29:35.570 --> 05:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so it's not some
 
05:29:39.230 --> 05:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
parent or student or whatever
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it's covered all by the criminal
 
05:29:42.240 --> 05:29:45.170 align:start position:0%
and it's covered all by the criminal
code

05:29:45.170 --> 05:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
well that still Rings a concern to me
 
05:29:48.000 --> 05:29:48.590 align:start position:0%
well that still Rings a concern to me
um

05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:50.690 --> 05:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
the other part that I have a concern on
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
is down on lines 29 and 30.
 
05:29:58.250 --> 05:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
complaints submitted by parents are
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
permanent Guardians
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
in Statue what's the difference between
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
a permanent guardian and a guardian or
 
05:30:09.890 --> 05:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
is a child placed in Foster families
 
05:30:14.930 --> 05:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're not able to make a complaint but
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are supervising
 
05:30:27.730 --> 05:30:27.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.288 --> 05:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
these are some of the things that just
 
05:30:32.030 --> 05:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know I had written down in pencil
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
here so I don't have this with me today
 
05:30:35.510 --> 05:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's nothing I've written right
 
05:30:38.810 --> 05:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
now I've had those concerns about that
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
language is it
 
05:30:43.788 --> 05:30:43.798 align:start position:0%
is there an issue associated with our
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
trying to narrow it down to that point
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
submitted by it by parents
 
05:30:51.350 --> 05:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
well that
 
05:30:53.208 --> 05:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm not an attorney I can't
 
05:30:58.490 --> 05:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
answer that uh or permanent Guardians
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between the person
 
05:31:04.490 --> 05:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
has a guardian or a custodian or
 
05:31:04.500 --> 05:31:10.010 align:start position:0%
has a guardian or a custodian or
custody

05:31:10.010 --> 05:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm
 
05:31:14.030 --> 05:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
prettily thank you
 
05:31:17.030 --> 05:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
um that was taken from elsewhere instead
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
a statute parents of permanent Guardians
 
05:31:25.010 --> 05:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
and the intent there was to restrict it
 
05:31:28.490 --> 05:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so that someone walking off the
 
05:31:32.270 --> 05:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
street wouldn't be coming into file a
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
complaint about about something I wanted
 
05:31:39.850 --> 05:31:39.860 align:start position:0%
someone who has a child in in the school
 
05:31:44.288 --> 05:31:44.298 align:start position:0%
that was the purpose there and in
 
05:31:47.170 --> 05:31:47.180 align:start position:0%
section two
 
05:31:52.190 --> 05:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
that the current verbiage is no
 
05:31:55.250 --> 05:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
recognized established School Museum Etc
 
05:31:58.610 --> 05:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
that's current law
 
05:32:01.610 --> 05:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
um I changed School
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
so that K-12 was no longer Exempted and
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
just the institutions and the university
 
05:32:12.050 --> 05:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
system the community college system were
 
05:32:12.060 --> 05:32:13.190 align:start position:0%
system the community college system were
Exempted

05:32:13.190 --> 05:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
05:32:15.770 --> 05:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
so I you'll see school is crossed out
 
05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
but that's what is in current language
 
05:32:18.600 --> 05:32:20.150 align:start position:0%
but that's what is in current language
now

05:32:20.150 --> 05:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:32:20.160 --> 05:32:21.610 align:start position:0%
now
um

05:32:21.610 --> 05:32:21.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:23.868 --> 05:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why
 
05:32:29.570 --> 05:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
K-12 education should be exempt from our
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
obscenity laws that's the basic question
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
um you know should uh you know public
 
05:32:40.190 --> 05:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
libraries we talked about public
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
libraries they're
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
um they're exempt so if you want to take
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
out whatever book you can put in a
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
request in a library alone if you want
 
05:32:51.958 --> 05:32:53.050 align:start position:0%
request in a library alone if you want
um

05:32:53.050 --> 05:32:53.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:57.770 --> 05:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
you know acting drama you know museums
 
05:33:00.050 --> 05:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's all exempt
 
05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think that K-12 education
 
05:33:06.830 --> 05:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
should be exempt from our obscenity loss
 
05:33:10.550 --> 05:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the basic um argument for me
 
05:33:13.010 --> 05:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
05:33:17.690 --> 05:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
another dimension to the discussion
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
and I think you might want to consider
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
you've got to use your red yeah I think
 
05:33:27.410 --> 05:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
you might want to consider making a
 
05:33:29.208 --> 05:33:29.218 align:start position:0%
distinction when you're talking about
 
05:33:33.410 --> 05:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
I've seen about visual images as opposed
 
05:33:36.170 --> 05:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
to written documentation
 
05:33:38.868 --> 05:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
such as the novel which might by some be
 
05:33:41.390 --> 05:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
considered obscene
 
05:33:44.570 --> 05:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
but if you make that novel in and of
 
05:33:46.610 --> 05:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
itself obscene
 
05:33:48.890 --> 05:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
and I stopped by my girlfriend's house
 
05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
and I have my books from college there
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
and her little brother reads it or plays
 
05:33:56.868 --> 05:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
with it or looks at it suddenly I am a
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
child abuser
 
05:34:01.128 --> 05:34:01.138 align:start position:0%
by your definition
 
05:34:03.470 --> 05:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
well I'm at it's it's worth considering
 
05:34:05.810 --> 05:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
because her parents are going to be on
 
05:34:07.970 --> 05:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
my case and they're not going to miss
 
05:34:07.980 --> 05:34:10.970 align:start position:0%
my case and they're not going to miss
words

05:34:10.970 --> 05:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:13.368 --> 05:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
Preston Belcher if I might clarify just
 
05:34:15.770 --> 05:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
to that point there is something of a
 
05:34:17.330 --> 05:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
point there but it has nothing to do
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
with this bill because this bill is only
 
05:34:22.128 --> 05:34:22.138 align:start position:0%
looking to exempt uh K-12 schools it
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
would not exempt individuals individuals
 
05:34:27.170 --> 05:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
are already not exempt they would be
 
05:34:30.170 --> 05:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
theoretically under this law although I
 
05:34:32.090 --> 05:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
believe it requires an affirmative act
 
05:34:34.490 --> 05:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
not an act of negligence allowing a
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
child to get to something it has to be
 
05:34:37.610 --> 05:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
done on purpose
 
05:34:37.620 --> 05:34:39.230 align:start position:0%
done on purpose
yeah

05:34:39.230 --> 05:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:34:42.830 --> 05:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask this question I do know of a
 
05:34:42.840 --> 05:34:43.910 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask this question I do know of a
school

05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:34:46.490 --> 05:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a library internally
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
they use the public library across the
 
05:34:48.958 --> 05:34:49.850 align:start position:0%
they use the public library across the
street

05:34:49.850 --> 05:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
street
 
05:34:52.368 --> 05:34:52.378 align:start position:0%
and Library classes are constantly going
 
05:34:54.410 --> 05:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
back and forth for instruction from the
 
05:34:56.750 --> 05:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
public school librarian
 
05:34:59.570 --> 05:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
this bill right here would make it
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
acceptable to have materials in a public
 
05:35:06.230 --> 05:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
library but that the public library is
 
05:35:10.368 --> 05:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.550 --> 05:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
so how how do we correct that issue
 
05:35:15.590 --> 05:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher if I may speak to that
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
again uh thank you Mr chair so again the
 
05:35:20.030 --> 05:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
the because we're dealing with something
 
05:35:22.610 --> 05:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
that falls under an element of criminal
 
05:35:24.770 --> 05:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
law there is an element what's called
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
men's Ria or Criminal Intent is going to
 
05:35:29.448 --> 05:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
be involved in this so it wouldn't be a
 
05:35:30.770 --> 05:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
matter of you walked across the street
 
05:35:31.970 --> 05:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
with your classroom and a student
 
05:35:34.010 --> 05:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
discovers a book it would have to be you
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
would have to put that book in the
 
05:35:37.730 --> 05:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
child's hand or assign it to them in
 
05:35:42.870 --> 05:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:42.880 --> 05:35:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
sorry to your point so if you're a
 
05:35:51.288 --> 05:35:51.298 align:start position:0%
librarian and you're the child brings a
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
book and you're checking it out
 
05:35:55.490 --> 05:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
um isn't she putting the book in the
 
05:35:58.610 --> 05:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
child's hand at that point
 
05:36:00.530 --> 05:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll speak to that um
 
05:36:03.170 --> 05:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
were you referencing public libraries
 
05:36:07.250 --> 05:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
because they're already Exempted no just
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
energy I'm just referring to the actions
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
so if the librarian is placing the book
 
05:36:15.770 --> 05:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
If the child brings a book and the title
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
takes it out is that from what you're
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
saying is that could be a crime
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about a public library
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
not a school library public libraries
 
05:36:29.150 --> 05:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
are Exempted from the law and this this
 
05:36:31.010 --> 05:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill does not take them off that
 
05:36:32.330 --> 05:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
exemption list so they would remain
 
05:36:34.610 --> 05:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
Exempted this only applies to school
 
05:36:36.890 --> 05:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
libraries you can make the case that a
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
teacher going over to a public library
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
with her school or with her students and
 
05:36:43.250 --> 05:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
placing a public library book into the
 
05:36:44.750 --> 05:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
hands of one of their students that
 
05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
violates the obscenity law would not be
 
05:36:50.448 --> 05:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
exempt but the public library itself is
 
05:36:50.458 --> 05:36:57.530 align:start position:0%
exempt but the public library itself is
accepted

05:36:57.530 --> 05:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:01.310 --> 05:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
can say that this situation is occurring
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
in one of the schools in my district
 
05:37:07.250 --> 05:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
where the teachers walk over across the
 
05:37:09.410 --> 05:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
street to the public library
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
and the public librarian along with the
 
05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
teacher or teacher assist pair that goes
 
05:37:16.610 --> 05:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:37:19.128 --> 05:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
helped sign these books out
 
05:37:19.138 --> 05:37:20.510 align:start position:0%
helped sign these books out
so

05:37:20.510 --> 05:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:23.330 --> 05:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and being a public library which is
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
accepted they're going to probably come
 
05:37:30.770 --> 05:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden thank you just
 
05:37:35.208 --> 05:37:35.218 align:start position:0%
to give another example I was a
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
superintendent for the lime school
 
05:37:39.470 --> 05:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
district and the person who did the
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
library media for the students K to
 
05:37:44.930 --> 05:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
eight was the public librarian in the
 
05:37:47.030 --> 05:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
library for the school was the public
 
05:37:50.448 --> 05:37:50.458 align:start position:0%
library across the street and she taught
 
05:37:53.208 --> 05:37:53.218 align:start position:0%
the classes so how do you distinguish
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
between public and private public and
 
05:38:02.650 --> 05:38:02.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
if we're going to get down into the
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
weeds like that would it be possible for
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
the parent to just say
 
05:38:11.810 --> 05:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
I think the books in the public library
 
05:38:15.430 --> 05:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
are obscene therefore my child cannot
 
05:38:18.350 --> 05:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
participate in that class going over to
 
05:38:21.288 --> 05:38:21.298 align:start position:0%
the library I mean so so that's a moot
 
05:38:23.510 --> 05:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
point then
 
05:38:25.330 --> 05:38:25.340 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:38:28.610 --> 05:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you I can't
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
keep up with the computer though Belcher
 
05:38:32.330 --> 05:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
over there I still have my flip phone
 
05:38:32.340 --> 05:38:33.410 align:start position:0%
over there I still have my flip phone
but

05:38:33.410 --> 05:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:38:35.090 --> 05:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
um it does say in their first amendment
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh book Banning a definition I wanted to
 
05:38:39.230 --> 05:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
keep my thought I was thought book
 
05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
Banning I'm thinking if you take a book
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
out of the library then you're Banning
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
it but I must be wrong book Banning a
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
form of censorship occurs when private
 
05:38:49.610 --> 05:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
individuals government officials or
 
05:38:51.770 --> 05:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
organizations remove books from
 
05:38:54.050 --> 05:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
libraries School reading lists or
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
bookstore shells because they objective
 
05:38:57.350 --> 05:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
the consent idea of the theme so that's
 
05:38:59.690 --> 05:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
it sounds like book bang censorship to
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
me from the First Amendment encyclopedia
 
05:39:05.330 --> 05:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald wow you made my
 
05:39:11.330 --> 05:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
shot my hand excuse me you made mine and
 
05:39:12.890 --> 05:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
shoot up very fast representative
 
05:39:12.900 --> 05:39:14.090 align:start position:0%
shoot up very fast representative
woodcock

05:39:14.090 --> 05:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
05:39:16.010 --> 05:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
to your point I would just like to
 
05:39:17.810 --> 05:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
correct you on your use of the First
 
05:39:19.550 --> 05:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm assuming you're talking
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
about the United States Constitution
 
05:39:23.150 --> 05:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
according the First Amendment uh
 
05:39:25.550 --> 05:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
definition as presented
 
05:39:26.890 --> 05:39:26.900 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
according First Amendment so I believe
 
05:39:30.470 --> 05:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher was the one who
 
05:39:32.690 --> 05:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
noted earlier that the freedom of speech
 
05:39:34.730 --> 05:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
in the first amendment applies to the
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
people and not to the government again
 
05:39:38.868 --> 05:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
Public Schools or government entities so
 
05:39:42.288 --> 05:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
they would already be exempt from those
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:46.010 --> 05:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative luno
 
05:39:49.270 --> 05:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
do you have something
 
05:39:54.190 --> 05:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
actually Mr chair I I do have something
 
05:39:59.810 --> 05:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
and at the risk of
 
05:39:59.820 --> 05:40:00.670 align:start position:0%
and at the risk of
um

05:40:00.670 --> 05:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:03.890 --> 05:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
sounding really sort of out of water on
 
05:40:07.010 --> 05:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
on 650 which is not an area that I think
 
05:40:09.230 --> 05:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
this committee spends much time in it's
 
05:40:12.230 --> 05:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
probably not in our books either
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
right fair enough
 
05:40:16.550 --> 05:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
650 is an area we spend a whole lot of
 
05:40:17.930 --> 05:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
time in
 
05:40:20.208 --> 05:40:20.218 align:start position:0%
um but with the with the change
 
05:40:23.150 --> 05:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
on line six and elsewhere How would how
 
05:40:26.570 --> 05:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
would then this not apply to let's say
 
05:40:28.970 --> 05:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College
 
05:40:35.628 --> 05:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
no um well for one thing Dartmouth
 
05:40:40.550 --> 05:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
College was established before the state
 
05:40:43.730 --> 05:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
was established and so
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
um Dartmouth is not beholding to much of
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
what we do in terms of in terms of
 
05:40:49.080 --> 05:40:50.030 align:start position:0%
what we do in terms of in terms of
um

05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:52.910 --> 05:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
um degree granting Authority but yeah
 
05:40:56.810 --> 05:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
but um you know when yeah and so yeah I
 
05:40:59.570 --> 05:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
mean any any of our private colleges but
 
05:41:01.970 --> 05:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know in looking at 650 and again I
 
05:41:03.470 --> 05:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of experience with it
 
05:41:05.810 --> 05:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
it starts with definition
 
05:41:08.570 --> 05:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
it then talks about offenses a guilty a
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he
 
05:41:13.730 --> 05:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
commits obscenity when talks about this
 
05:41:16.128 --> 05:41:16.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that a person employed at a
 
05:41:17.930 --> 05:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
government you know
 
05:41:20.448 --> 05:41:20.458 align:start position:0%
um institution doesn't say that the
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
first use of the word government is in
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
is in section 650 colon 4 uh where it
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
says justifiable and non-commercial
 
05:41:32.270 --> 05:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
private uh dissemination so
 
05:41:35.208 --> 05:41:35.218 align:start position:0%
non-commercial private
 
05:41:38.570 --> 05:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and it talks about
 
05:41:41.810 --> 05:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
it just uses the word governmental there
 
05:41:43.490 --> 05:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
not used anywhere else until you get to
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
650 colon six
 
05:41:51.050 --> 05:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
and the word governmental agency I don't
 
05:41:53.750 --> 05:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
think applies to all of the other
 
05:41:53.760 --> 05:41:55.310 align:start position:0%
think applies to all of the other
descriptors

05:41:55.310 --> 05:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
descriptors
 
05:41:55.320 --> 05:41:56.390 align:start position:0%
descriptors
um

05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:58.430 --> 05:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
in there and so when you want when you
 
05:42:00.530 --> 05:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
take out school and you replace it with
 
05:42:02.090 --> 05:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
University system and Community College
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
system I think basically your your your
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
saying it now applies to all schools
 
05:42:10.430 --> 05:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
that are not part of the University
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
system or community college system
 
05:42:22.910 --> 05:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:25.490 --> 05:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you in section one
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
um under 654 uh institutions of persons
 
05:42:38.930 --> 05:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
having a scientific educational is
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
crossed out and higher education is
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
substituted as six 650 colon for Roman
 
05:42:46.798 --> 05:42:48.050 align:start position:0%
substituted as six 650 colon for Roman
one

05:42:48.050 --> 05:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:42:52.430 --> 05:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
so higher education is substituted for
 
05:42:55.970 --> 05:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
education so that we're exempting K-12
 
05:42:59.170 --> 05:42:59.180 align:start position:0%
but higher education remains um exempt
 
05:43:08.090 --> 05:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:10.430 --> 05:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's chairman may I yeah help on this
 
05:43:12.350 --> 05:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
one I think it actually is going to make
 
05:43:14.208 --> 05:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
more sense to you if you go to the
 
05:43:17.570 --> 05:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
actual RSA 650 colon 4 and if you go
 
05:43:19.128 --> 05:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
there what you will see is it says
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
justifiable and non-commercial private
 
05:43:23.570 --> 05:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
dissemination isn't a it is an
 
05:43:25.850 --> 05:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense to prosecution under
 
05:43:28.010 --> 05:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
this chapter that dissemination was
 
05:43:30.770 --> 05:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
restricted to the following it then has
 
05:43:33.830 --> 05:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
line one so it doesn't say all that in
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
the current bill you're looking at right
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
but it modifies line one under that
 
05:43:41.090 --> 05:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
section and that's where that exemption
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh comes from so it's it's basically the
 
05:43:45.530 --> 05:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
same mistake I made earlier today
 
05:43:50.510 --> 05:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
he seems good defense approximation
 
05:43:54.470 --> 05:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:57.708 --> 05:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
yeah you're still going through
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
your exempt from your exempt from
 
05:44:05.810 --> 05:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:07.490 --> 05:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:44:09.708 --> 05:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
representative I just wanna I've been
 
05:44:11.090 --> 05:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
thinking about this and about what you
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
said about this whole situation where
 
05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
the public library or the public school
 
05:44:16.490 --> 05:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
kids are going over to the public
 
05:44:17.930 --> 05:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
library and as you know I work in a
 
05:44:21.650 --> 05:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
public library and I'm thinking we are
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
experiencing similar problems where
 
05:44:25.250 --> 05:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
people are objecting to obscene books in
 
05:44:28.010 --> 05:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
our collection and
 
05:44:30.288 --> 05:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
fortunately those books are kept in the
 
05:44:33.650 --> 05:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
adult section uh
 
05:44:36.890 --> 05:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that if a public school
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
is using the public library for their
 
05:44:41.690 --> 05:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
kids to go over that they would uh only
 
05:44:43.970 --> 05:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
let the students be in the children's
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
room where those materials generally are
 
05:44:48.048 --> 05:44:48.058 align:start position:0%
not kept I just want to get that out
 
05:44:49.430 --> 05:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
there because I'm thinking this whole
 
05:44:52.250 --> 05:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
time about it I don't know how okay to
 
05:44:55.010 --> 05:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
12. okay so that's the problem with
 
05:44:56.570 --> 05:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
public library because anybody can go
 
05:44:58.610 --> 05:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
and access yeah but anybody can access
 
05:45:00.650 --> 05:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
you go into a public library and you can
 
05:45:02.030 --> 05:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
do your best to kind of separate the
 
05:45:04.010 --> 05:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
kids stuff from the adult stuff but you
 
05:45:06.410 --> 05:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
know the kids are free to go wander up
 
05:45:08.448 --> 05:45:08.458 align:start position:0%
to the adult section where there are
 
05:45:11.090 --> 05:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
some very questionable books so
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
um I just want to get that out there
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
just from my experience
 
05:45:18.010 --> 05:45:18.020 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
05:45:22.910 --> 05:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill at this point in time Mr chair I'd
 
05:45:25.548 --> 05:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
ask for a three-minute caucus please you
 
05:45:25.558 --> 05:45:27.890 align:start position:0%
ask for a three-minute caucus please you
may

05:45:27.890 --> 05:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:33.170 --> 05:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:36.110 --> 05:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
and uh let's make it a little bit longer
 
05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
in case people have to make a you know
 
05:45:41.288 --> 05:45:41.298 align:start position:0%
an entry somewhere else
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:56.520 --> 05:45:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
ER

05:45:58.150 --> 05:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
ER
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.368 --> 05:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.378 --> 05:46:36.548 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:46:42.110 --> 05:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
bothered me because no one could have
 
05:46:44.448 --> 05:46:44.458 align:start position:0%
spoken up eventually you feel
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable by the people who are
 
05:46:50.170 --> 05:46:50.180 align:start position:0%
insisting that they use this thing yeah
 
05:46:54.170 --> 05:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
whatever gender they claim to be and yet
 
05:46:56.330 --> 05:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
they have genitalia that men should
 
05:46:59.208 --> 05:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
argue the other way and I think somehow
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
we need to show as much respect for the
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
other kids as for those who are
 
05:47:05.360 --> 05:47:15.548 align:start position:0%
other kids as for those who are
[Music]

05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:18.470 --> 05:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
some kids are scared
 
05:47:21.788 --> 05:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you we even if we go
 
05:47:24.770 --> 05:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
marginal recommendation this is not
 
05:47:27.170 --> 05:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
going to pass honestly no no I don't
 
05:47:29.690 --> 05:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
think it's gonna it's not shouted down
 
05:47:31.490 --> 05:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
before it's even well if there's there's
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
enough people to have some freaking
 
05:47:39.368 --> 05:47:39.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:41.090 --> 05:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:41.100 --> 05:47:45.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
consideration

05:47:45.070 --> 05:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:48.368 --> 05:47:48.378 align:start position:0%
oh well I've got to go myself right now
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:55.670 --> 05:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right what did you gather you got it
 
05:47:58.548 --> 05:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
I know that's right yeah
 
05:48:01.850 --> 05:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
some people have a five gallon tank some
 
05:48:04.010 --> 05:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
people have one young tank and sometimes
 
05:48:05.628 --> 05:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
you have conditions that make this
 
05:48:10.610 --> 05:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:12.410 --> 05:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
just like the old saying my mother used
 
05:48:15.230 --> 05:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
to do you know when we're driving yeah
 
05:48:16.970 --> 05:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
yeah she put the hose through the
 
05:48:19.430 --> 05:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
floorboards and put a funnel on it and
 
05:48:22.810 --> 05:48:22.820 align:start position:0%
that voice we were required to use that
 
05:48:25.610 --> 05:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
and just keep them wide enough just keep
 
05:48:28.250 --> 05:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
our going right she wouldn't stop yeah
 
05:48:29.990 --> 05:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
she'd buy because one bottle of Orange
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.718 --> 05:52:41.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:52:41.330 --> 05:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.340 --> 06:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.208 --> 06:06:34.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:36.590 --> 06:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
unless there is
 
06:06:39.288 --> 06:06:39.298 align:start position:0%
something new that hasn't been discussed
 
06:06:41.930 --> 06:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
or presented I'd like to go right into
 
06:06:45.048 --> 06:06:45.058 align:start position:0%
the taking action on the Motions on the
 
06:06:48.110 --> 06:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
floor is there any further discussion on
 
06:06:48.120 --> 06:06:52.310 align:start position:0%
floor is there any further discussion on
514

uh we had a lot of discussion and I'm
 
06:08:28.548 --> 06:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
just going to summarize a few points of
 
06:08:28.558 --> 06:08:29.628 align:start position:0%
just going to summarize a few points of
it

06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:08:31.610 --> 06:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
um one is that this bill essentially is
 
06:08:32.930 --> 06:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
a book ban
 
06:08:35.270 --> 06:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
parents in New Hampshire already have
 
06:08:37.730 --> 06:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
the right to review materials and opt
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
their child out of anything that they
 
06:08:41.810 --> 06:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
find objectionable for school district
 
06:08:44.570 --> 06:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
policies and I have one in front of me
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
right here which is exactly the opt-out
 
06:08:50.390 --> 06:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
hang on sorry
 
06:08:54.530 --> 06:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
this is the opt-out policy it's uh
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
policy kec and it references public
 
06:08:59.150 --> 06:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
concerns and complaints about
 
06:09:01.730 --> 06:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
instructional resources
 
06:09:05.448 --> 06:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
um and it's it goes in a very uh detail
 
06:09:07.368 --> 06:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
about what that process is and what the
 
06:09:10.730 --> 06:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
appeal process is so this policy is
 
06:09:12.288 --> 06:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
already in place in most school
 
06:09:15.230 --> 06:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
districts and that's a majority of the
 
06:09:19.310 --> 06:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
bill just to continue on I feel uh I
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
think that this bill
 
06:09:24.288 --> 06:09:24.298 align:start position:0%
is putting in the hands of other parents
 
06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
what what other parents kids can do and
 
06:09:31.250 --> 06:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
can't do I find that also there's a lot
 
06:09:34.190 --> 06:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
of definitions in here are that are kind
 
06:09:36.230 --> 06:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
of subjective who determines what's
 
06:09:39.288 --> 06:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
objectionable what's obscene and what's
 
06:09:42.110 --> 06:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
age-appropriate because what's what that
 
06:09:43.788 --> 06:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
means to me as a parent might be
 
06:09:45.288 --> 06:09:45.298 align:start position:0%
different than what it means to a
 
06:09:47.208 --> 06:09:47.218 align:start position:0%
different parent
 
06:09:49.730 --> 06:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and students should have a wide
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
access to materials and school Personnel
 
06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
are trained to review materials selected
 
06:09:57.470 --> 06:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
for their schools and their number of
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
policies in place that specifically
 
06:10:03.230 --> 06:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
address how school districts select the
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
books and materials for their school
 
06:10:05.400 --> 06:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
books and materials for their school
districts

06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:10:09.650 --> 06:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
um so I feel very strong that this bill
 
06:10:11.150 --> 06:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
should igl
 
06:10:12.890 --> 06:10:12.900 align:start position:0%

children are experiencing moral injury
 
06:10:20.030 --> 06:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're being shown porn
 
06:10:21.948 --> 06:10:21.958 align:start position:0%

06:15:37.090 --> 06:15:37.100 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
06:15:40.910 --> 06:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
we have no meetings tomorrow and have no
 
06:15:42.890 --> 06:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
meetings on Monday Monday being a
 
06:15:45.530 --> 06:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
holiday so we have four days ahead of us
 
06:15:47.868 --> 06:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
to rest up
 
06:15:50.448 --> 06:15:50.458 align:start position:0%
regain ourselves we will be meeting on
 
06:15:51.948 --> 06:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
the 21st
 
06:15:56.930 --> 06:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
for for hearings here uh in this room we
 
06:15:59.448 --> 06:15:59.458 align:start position:0%
will most likely have session on the
 
06:16:01.850 --> 06:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
22nd and 23rd
 
06:16:05.628 --> 06:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
we will meet here on the 24th for
 
06:16:07.010 --> 06:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
further hearings
 
06:16:12.230 --> 06:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can finish earrings on
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
all the bills which we've had in
 
06:16:16.670 --> 06:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
education by the break
 
06:16:19.788 --> 06:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
and then come back after the break and
 
06:16:21.470 --> 06:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
start executing the remaining bills
 
06:16:23.208 --> 06:16:23.218 align:start position:0%
which we have not exact
 
06:16:24.650 --> 06:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
but we're just all going to have to
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
really get on task during those you know
 
06:16:28.970 --> 06:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
the weeks of the days in March to do
 
06:16:32.270 --> 06:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
that I think we can do it we're just
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit quicker with
 
06:16:37.730 --> 06:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:40.310 --> 06:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
the reports today
 
06:16:42.288 --> 06:16:42.298 align:start position:0%
are needed
 
06:16:44.690 --> 06:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
actually we've gone by the due date
 
06:16:46.430 --> 06:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
already here
 
06:16:49.250 --> 06:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to go so far that you
 
06:16:51.230 --> 06:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
forget to do the report and that's
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
happened many times before
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I've ended up having to write a lot
 
06:16:58.810 --> 06:16:58.820 align:start position:0%
of reports and that I don't care to do
 
06:17:02.208 --> 06:17:02.218 align:start position:0%
so let's see we're out on Monday I think
 
06:17:04.368 --> 06:17:04.378 align:start position:0%
when you
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
come back on I'd like to have them if we
 
06:17:07.680 --> 06:17:08.510 align:start position:0%
come back on I'd like to have them if we
can

06:17:08.510 --> 06:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:17:13.970 --> 06:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
by by sometime at the latest on Monday
 
06:17:16.128 --> 06:17:16.138 align:start position:0%
so that means you have to email them to
 
06:17:20.030 --> 06:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
me you got the email using the uh
 
06:17:22.490 --> 06:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
template that we have for reporting
 
06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
please that makes it a lot easier if you
 
06:17:27.530 --> 06:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
don't have the template let me know and
 
06:17:30.110 --> 06:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
we'll email you another attachment with
 
06:17:33.368 --> 06:17:33.378 align:start position:0%
the template there to get your your
 
06:17:38.990 --> 06:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.770 --> 06:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
on 71 you know we we we're going to get
 
06:17:44.868 --> 06:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
a whole doe and do a little bit more
 
06:17:46.128 --> 06:17:46.138 align:start position:0%
understanding where we are on that
 
06:17:48.770 --> 06:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's on hold there's we we
 
06:17:51.410 --> 06:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
didn't conclude that
 
06:17:51.420 --> 06:17:57.430 align:start position:0%
didn't conclude that
um

06:17:57.430 --> 06:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:05.090 --> 06:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
where there is no recommendation yes
 
06:18:09.170 --> 06:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
both sides have to write the reports
 
06:18:11.628 --> 06:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
so thank you everybody have a good four
 
06:18:11.638 --> 06:18:13.128 align:start position:0%
so thank you everybody have a good four
days

06:18:13.128 --> 06:18:13.138 align:start position:0%

06:18:17.930 --> 06:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:22.310 --> 06:18:22.320 align:start position:0%

06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:34.930 --> 06:18:34.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:37.448 --> 06:18:37.458 align:start position:0%
everybody listen up please
 
06:18:40.490 --> 06:18:40.500 align:start position:0%

06:18:42.410 --> 06:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
this exacting done before we go out and
 
06:18:45.770 --> 06:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
break on the 24th because that could put
 
06:18:48.650 --> 06:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
probably into that that calendar where
 
06:18:49.730 --> 06:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hearing some things
 
06:18:51.230 --> 06:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to accept some of the
 
06:18:53.628 --> 06:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
bills we had on our platter today and
 
06:18:55.730 --> 06:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
try to get some of that washed out other
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
than the ones which we need more
 
06:18:59.570 --> 06:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
information on we won't go that route
 
06:19:02.390 --> 06:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
but we didn't get to
 
06:19:07.850 --> 06:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
um 563 we didn't get the 394 to 632 and
 
06:19:10.250 --> 06:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to be holding off on on the
 
06:19:12.830 --> 06:19:12.840 align:start position:0%

06:19:15.410 --> 06:19:15.420 align:start position:0%

06:19:19.730 --> 06:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
building eight we held off in that other
 
06:19:21.470 --> 06:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
than that those are the ones I really
 
06:19:23.810 --> 06:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
want to take care of and we could also
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh if we have some bills we want to exec
 
06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%

06:19:32.510 --> 06:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
bills which we are hearing on that day
 
06:19:35.570 --> 06:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
