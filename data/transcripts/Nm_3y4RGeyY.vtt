today

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%

all right so I think I'm going to start
 
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
list make it easy for everybody to find
 
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
are um on House Bill
 
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
105 representative groda you have a
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.510 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
representative

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
gr yes um the intention my intention was
 
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
to um work on this bill over the
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
summer and it became evident that coming
 
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
consensus was not going to be easily
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
attained so I think we should just put
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
this away for some other
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
day Okay do you wish to speak to your
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
second representative
 
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else have any comments
 
00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.270 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else have any comments
or

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I will I will mention
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
that the people in the industry that got
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
involved had were not unanimous in
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
support by any means and in fact many of
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
them didn't want any um oversight at
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
all so until they figure that out
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
themselves it didn't seem appropriate to
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
second representative uh laus

seconds do you wish to speak to your
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
motion um sure um and looking at this
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think we've determined that um
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
it really really affects a very small
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
number of people and this isn't really a
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
a door that we want to open um and start
 
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
a conversation in other areas it just
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
seems better to leave things as they are
 
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
and and the fire academy will have to
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
seek another
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your second uh no thanks okay
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
I'd like to to comment that I got from
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
the retirement system a report on how
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
many hours retirees are
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
working and the average for everybody is
 
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
537 hours the average for firefighters
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
is less than
 
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
500 so running into the 1300
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
hours that um that's the limit sorry
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
1352 is only going to be a very few
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
people what's that so I I can give that
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
to people it was really enlightening
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
we struggle to to put a limit on it when
 
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
there are actually very few retirees
 
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
that are working enough hours to make a
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
difference yeah there's not enough
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody but you can at
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right and I will we had a
 
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on the amendment on
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
Monday what this does is
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
remove basically everything that was
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
originally in House Bill
 
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
274 because some of it was included in
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 357 which
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
passed and some of it is had it had
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
major issues the part about the
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
committee taking action in place of the
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
whole house has some constitutional
 
00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:57.389 align:start position:0%
whole house has some constitutional
questions

00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure enough that it's
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
correct that to want to fight it so I
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
took that part
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
out a number of agencies needed to be
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
removed from the bill because they are
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
not actually state
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
agencies they are deliberately separate
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
from the state government in order to
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
um whatever the housing authority and um
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
some other lending
 
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.150 align:start position:0%
some other lending
agencies

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
um they cannot fall under the our
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority without violating
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
their status as independent
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
agencies so they have been removed there
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
were um if any of you remember either of
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
the hearings we held on that bill they
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
all came out in force to tell us
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
so so I agreed with them what the
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
amendment let put in is a little bit
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
more of legislative oversight or at
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
least hopefully legislative
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
oversight it requires when the notices
 
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:15.189 align:start position:0%
oversight it requires when the notices
go

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
out in all cases they send it to known
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders which is not defined but if
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
the agency doesn't know who cares about
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
their rules they ought to and they
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
should send all of them notice of new of
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
these new
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
rules and if there is new legislation
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
involved the agency sends notice of the
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
rule to the
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
legislature in particular
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
the legislative leadership and the
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
chairs of the
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh policy
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
committees we can't force them to
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
actually pay attention to the rules but
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
we can at least make sure they get a
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
notice and that's what that does
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
and also it adds if
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
the rule is it is objected to by jail
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
car without going to a final objection
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
without going to a joint
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you I
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
was yes on the final OB objection no on
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
the joint
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
resolution they can adopt the agency can
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
adopt the rule but it needs to prove
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
that it meets legislative
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
intent and this says that in that rare
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
case and they lose the agency pays the
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's legal costs which will help
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
encourage people to uh to challenge a
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
rule and I got
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
information which I sent to you on the
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
number of final objections and joint
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
resolutions um for final
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
objections there there was one in 2013
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
2019 and that's
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
resolutions there's been only one since
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
11 which was in 2019 which
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
um there was no legislative action taken
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
on the rule on the
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
resolution so these are very rare
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
occurrences we don't need to worry that
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
the agencies are going to get sued over
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
their rules every weekend it just that
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
if they do adopt a rule
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
without over the objection of jail car
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
then and they lose then they have to pay
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a fairly
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
minor um
 
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
penalty representative Brer do you wish
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
to speak to your second I do thank you
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
madam chair what I support about this
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it does loop in the
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
legislative committees I think that
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
often times when we write legislation we
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
lose sight of the fact that that's
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
really only half the work the rest of it
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
has to do with rule making and it's
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
important that those rules represent the
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and that this is a is
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
direction anyone else have a comment
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
what representative
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair so
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
um I think that the informational aspect
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
that you talked about early on in your
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
remarks uh is can only be beneficial to
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
the degree that stakeholders are better
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
informed about um you know upcoming
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
rules and so forth and therefore able to
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
participate if they have issues they're
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
welcome to do so at the present moment
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh but to the degree that they don't
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
know about the issue they obviously uh
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
are not going to show up uh so the
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
informational aspect I think can only
 
00:18:10.149 --> 00:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
benefit the process with regard to the
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
um the number of final objections and
 
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
um the number of final objections and
joint

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
joint
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
resolutions uh as a 17-year member of
 
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
the Jael car uh I was pretty sure that
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
the number was going was going to be
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
extremely small and one of the reasons
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
is um that the agencies are very
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
reluctant to um to go into that uh um
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
you know um Gauntlet of
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh of implementing a rule that the
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislature has put a final that the jel
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
car has put a final objection on um
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
because they're asking uh to be sued and
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
and to have no support from the state uh
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
so I think it it's extremely unlikely
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see a number of such
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
instances uh and to the degree that that
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
do this can only be uh um you know
 
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial so I think even though it's
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
not likely to go into effect I mean to
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
to be in in uh in action very
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
often better to have a safety net the
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
time the acrobat Falls than have none at
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
all so uh I will be supportive of the
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you representative Gart
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
the uh gray pages of the union leader
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
but that's generally not very effective
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
um there's no newspaper they
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
not if you do you want to know how this
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
actually done in case of
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
lies that an no I was more oh no I was
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
just more concerned about the cost but
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's a cost of doing
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
business representative laus so I I
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
think the answer is just oplc pays for
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
it out of you know the money money they
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
collect it's one of the costs of doing
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
business for for lienes is sending out
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%

notices
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that they do send as many
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
out by email as they can but uh not not
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
not everybody has email these
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
days it's very few any other questions
 
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.430 align:start position:0%
days it's very few any other questions

okay you wish to speak to your motion I

bill were included in Senate Bill 207
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
which uh passed the legislature signed
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
by the governor and became
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
law um there had been some discussion
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
about an amendment to include the Mental
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
Health compact uh the committee never
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
acted on it and uh representative
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
Shapiro who wanted that has introduced
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
it as an LSR so we'll probably be seeing
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%

HB

00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
449 all second okay do you wish to speak
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
to your motion um yes um 449 was a bill
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we retained um well we kind of
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
waited to see what happened with HB uh
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
436 um dealing with group two retirement
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
benefits um that bill is now being
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
looked at by the retirement commission
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
and coming up with a recommendation on
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
how to move forward so um this bill is
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
no longer necessary for anything so
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
we're recommending I at this point
 
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.470 align:start position:0%
we're recommending I at this point
represent

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
BR I have nothing to add
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
okay as part of the retirement
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
commission we think it would make more
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
sense to attach our fix to house bill
 
00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:58.470 align:start position:0%
sense to attach our fix to house bill
for

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
4 um 436 itself which was retained in
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
finance because that's already been
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
approved by the house once and
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
so if the finance committee approves
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
what the rec uh retirement commission
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
recommends it can go to the floor in
 
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
January and then be voted on there and
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
then go to the Senate um so the
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
commission is vigorously pursuing
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
various options that they think can get
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
strong support in both the house and the
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
Senate and I think having one bill to
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
move forward rather than two would make
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
easier

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
easier
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing none the motion is
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.789 align:start position:0%
 
449

00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
up oh sorry about sorry about the
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
proactive

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is inexpedient to
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 449 and the
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
consent okay House Bill
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
518 representative
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
groa yes um Madam chair on Monday we had
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
a hearing for an amendment to House Bill
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
518 and the comments there were some
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
grammatical errors made in the amendment
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
so in front of you is the revised
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
2426 and I move Amendment
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
that do you wish to speak to your motion
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so during the summer I
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
mean during the Spring you might recall
 
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
that um this committee did a lot of work
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 65
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
5 and in tandem with House Bill 2 so one
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
of the issues that we did we handled was
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
um addressing the rather large house
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
bill 655 and making sure that it was
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
harmonious with what was in House Bill
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
2 um in addition so there were
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
some little Schnebly left Parts left
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
that we needed to be tidied up and House
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 518 addresses that specifically IT
 
00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:27.870 align:start position:0%
Bill 518 addresses that specifically IT
addresses

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
the issuances of licenses which are Now
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
function of the office as opposed to the
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
board it also includes the
 
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.590 align:start position:0%
board it also includes the
disciplinary

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.310 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
um

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh disciplinary um responsibility of the
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
office and the board and I think that's
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
amendment yes
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
the the issue that we discussed on
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
Monday was what happens when when
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
licenses are expiring and we esta and
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
this language now establishes that there
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
is a 60-day notice prior to
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
expiration and as long as the renewal
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
application is received in that 60 days
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
the license
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
continues and is pro until it is issued
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
if the renewal request comes in after
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
the 60 days
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
but within a year it can be reinstated
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
without further penalty but they are
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
practicing without a license for the
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
period of the lapse which could be
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
year and at that point it might be
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.909 align:start position:0%
subject to
discipline

00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
but it seemed reasonable to us to
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
establish those guidelines
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
because various boards had various other
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
definitions of when the license expired
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
when they renewal had to be in and what
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
you had to do to U continue your license
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
and so this establishes a standard
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
policy for all the boards which was uh
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
appreciated does anyone else have
 
00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:24.039 align:start position:0%
comments or
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so I
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
wonder whether uh because I don't recall
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
this question was asked uh on Monday uh
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
whether this is in point of fact a
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
relatively common or relatively uncommon
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh event that somebody um neglects to uh
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
renew their license and therefore that
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
they are technically practicing without
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
a license uh whether this is something
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
that oplc has any kind of information on
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
well it's convenient director Courtney
 
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
do you have a response to
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
their question Lindsay Courtney
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
oplc um I don't have specific numbers in
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
front of you I would say it's very
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
profession specific uh it's very common
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
with licensed nursing assistance um it's
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
also very common with real estate
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
salespersons um in the past I think in
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
the professions that allowed late
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
renewal it's also fairly common um some
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the technical professions but then
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
other professions are very good about
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
renewing on time I would say Allied
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
Health falls into that bucket
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
um question Madam chair yes thank you
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
for that previous answer uh director uh
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
so um I if you can get good adherence
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
from certain professions and poor
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
adherence from some other professions
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
are you undertaking any efforts to try
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
to uh either wrap them on the knuckles
 
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
or uh larger
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
print so they so they don't uh do that
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
because it's not a good idea obviously
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
to have that sloppy adherence or
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
compliance so what are you doing to try
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
to ameliorate the
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
situation well I think our position is
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
that it's it's in Upon A licy to renew
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
their license on time we provide
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
notification um and then if they
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
practice without a license that is
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
subject to discipline by the board I
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
won't you know I don't want to
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
stereotype professions but there there's
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
a culture involved with certain
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
professions as opposed to others that um
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
may make more
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
professions um uh encourage them to Ren
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
their licenses on time um particularly
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
in healthcare we often see that the
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
employer is monitoring it because
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
obviously they can't be reimbursed for
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
payment um if the provider or the
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare practitioner is not license
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
so when we speak to alenas they usually
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
find out that their license is expired
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
because their employer has told them
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
they can't show up for work um so that's
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
another mechanism for internal controls
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist in um other
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
professions that don't have that
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement piece and and I understand
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
that with real estate a AG there's a lot
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
of turnover and so somebody may not
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
renew their license not expecting to be
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
active and then they got a commission so
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
they say well I better get my license in
 
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.669 align:start position:0%
they say well I better get my license in
yes

00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
corrects thank you I think that helps
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
those any other questions or concerns
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
director anyone
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
else all right and I will say that this
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful letter we got is
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because because it deals with
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
the content of the original House Bill
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
518 which has been totally removed by
 
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.750 align:start position:0%
518 which has been totally removed by
this

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
amendment and and and in fact I will say
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the content of House Bill 518 which
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
was a study committee was felt that the
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
and um other professionals can should
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
work it out themselves and not bother us
 
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.150 align:start position:0%
work it out themselves and not bother us
about

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
it anyone
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
else okay that case the motion is to
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 2426 H to House Bill 518
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%

not here yet I'd like to skip over to
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
106 and ask representative broer for a
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
motion yes I move OTP on House Bill on
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 106 and I'll second
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay represent BR do you wish to speak
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
on it yes um this bill um was brought to
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
us because there was a need for
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
certifying um there need to be a
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
professional certification for child
 
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.670 align:start position:0%
professional certification for child
care

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
programs and it seemed that there were
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
rules that were going to be written on
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
this matter but those rules were not
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
written and it did not seem that there
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
would be an intention to write the rules
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately we're putting this in
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
law represent leus um yes I mean I agree
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
with all that it's um they wrote a long
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
and uh interesting non-responsive uh
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
response to us um I thought since they
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
had statutory authority to do all of the
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh child care licensing and they did it
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
for everything else it should be
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
consistent they should have done it
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
which is um you know why I didn't
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
support this originally but given their
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
response um I regretfully support
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
this represent grassic yes thank you uh
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chairperson and the members who
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
supported this bill this is certainly an
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
important bill when it comes to the
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
workers in child care uh this is a CR
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
issue which could have been simply done
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
through HHS by changing some of their
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
standards and they you know sitting in
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
rules simple uh they haven't done it
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
this allows uh kids who are taking these
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
programs in CTE programs at high school
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
level to utilize that credentialing
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
those credits uh to increase their
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
salaries and to better themselves in
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
their field when you have kids that are
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
coming out of high school that are
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
committed to working in child care it's
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
very rare these days and it's very
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
important that we support them and since
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
HHS is dragging their feet we need to
 
00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:52.150 align:start position:0%
HHS is dragging their feet we need to
push

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
push
 
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
them thank you anyone
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
else I I I agree that that's the
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
issue the these credentials are not
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory they're optional but they're
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
respected in the field and they're worth
 
00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
in the case of this emerging
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
professional it's worth $2 an hour which
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
is a lot considering that these people
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
are coming in at extremely low rates of
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
pay for the most
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
part so and since HHS has had the
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
Authority for better than 10 years to
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
write rules defining them and they
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
haven't bothered to do so and they
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
didn't bother to update their their
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
standards which are available on the
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
website but not adopted as
 
00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:44.750 align:start position:0%
website but not adopted as
rules

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh we feel they're being non-responsive
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
and it's time to take it in hand I I
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
would personally have preferred that we
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually establish those credentials in
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
statute since they're not bothering to
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
put them in rule but there were too many
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
other things for me to take it on and no
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
one else was was
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
volunteering so at this point all we're
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
doing is saying that the child care CTE
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
certificate is the same as an emerging
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
professional certificate and the uh
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
employer should honor it and I hope it
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
helps and I wish that HHS would
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.309 align:start position:0%
helps and I wish that HHS would
uh

00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
take if they're establishing these
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
things they should do it properly and
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
not just sort of under the table which
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
else thank you thank you all right in
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
that case the motion is ought to pass on
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%

um ought to pass with an amendment and
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%

all right M
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
chair I think we are kind of trampling
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
on a proper procedure uh in one respect
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see uh either that we
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
see he's doing that so in situations
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
such as this the appropriate motion is
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
to state that there will be an amendment
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
and the move ought to pass on the
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
amendment if it if it passes then we've
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
got a situation where we can have otpa
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
you can't move otpa until you got okay
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment adopted
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
soed small matter but let's do it right
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's up over over the summer I've
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%

your motion to adopt Amendment 2436 I'll
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%

so there were um two and and I had
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
emailed out an earlier Amendment and I
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
apologize it there are two sections that
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
need to be removed and the one I sent
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
but through email only removed one of
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
them and the uh paper I dropped on
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
people's desk I just got this morning
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh removes the two
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
sections and those were related to
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.670 align:start position:0%
sections and those were related to
um

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
the situation where if a booth is being
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
rented uh within an existing
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
Salon that it didn't require a whole
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
separate Salon license just for the
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
booth and um that you find it here sorry
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
I I have a quick question on that did we
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
not discuss this in House Bill two
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
exactly that's why we're taking it out
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
one okay so it is in house bill too um
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
it actually was included in in House
 
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.069 align:start position:0%
it actually was included in in House
Bill

00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
409 okay I knew that we had talked about
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
this before yeah so we're taking it out
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
of this one because we already have it
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
in something elsea right it was included
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 409 which has become law
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
and so this would just be a duplicate so
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
you're talking about removing 5B section
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
5B let me which is the section five in
 
00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
5B let me which is the section five in
this

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
amendment it's yes section five and six
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
um right because those are both well
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
that was done in 409 and
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
409 yes sa section five deletes RSA 313
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
A9 Roman B
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.950 align:start position:0%
A9 Roman B
which

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
says um that a booth license is
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
required right and the um section six is
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
the one that um explicitly says boots
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
attached or within a salon or barber
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
shop that are Opera independently shall
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
be subject to a lure in the same manner
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
but that but 409 takes that
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
out okay well if I read 5B it says hire
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
employ or rent to Booth to any person to
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
engage in a practice regulated by this
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
chapter unless such person then holds a
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
valid license or temporary permit issued
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
by the board so it's hire employee or
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
ventor Booth any person to engage
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
correct um in in where where are you
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
reading that from I'm reading 5B well
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
what section from which I'm reading I'm
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm reading from the from 644 okay
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
right but in 409 which became law it's
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
got for 313 A9
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
section and I believe in 409 it just
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
says hire employee or otherwise allow
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually it's oh okay so I understand I
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah yeah okay yeah it's
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
a little confusing what's with what yeah
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
six

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh the language that's in six is
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
identical to what's in uh section of
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
409 so 6 two remains any licensed Barber
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
shall upon written application
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
accompanied by receive a license to
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
operate a salon a barber shop or mobile
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
barber shop in the state yes it it
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's what establishes the need for a
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
shop license right and that is not
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
changed yeah the the text the text
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's in 64 4 section 6 is identical to
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
the text that got included in uh 409 in
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
the chaptered final version 235 col 6
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same language which was
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
adopted so there's no need for us to do
 
00:48:10.319 --> 00:48:12.349 align:start position:0%
adopted so there's no need for us to do
it

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
again yes representa ass Maybe by by way
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
of clarification so RSA
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
313a as written in law already contains
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
that language is that where it landed
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
you know what RSA had ended up in um
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
yeah 3 313 a 19 uh2 yeah so taking it
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
out of this doesn't remove it from the
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
RSA it's just taking it out of this bill
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
correct I mean the changes the changes
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
that 644 makes in in particular removing
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
Part B about booths is already removed
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh by by 409 okay and I don't know
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
what's actually up on gen Court I found
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're updating the rsas there very
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
slowly so it's still it's still saying
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
that people
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
who don't have a license
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
this can do the original bill you 644
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
with 644 the so 6 now that we've
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
establish what the amendment does which
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
is just take those components out of the
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill that were already in other
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
statutes the remainder of it remains
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
correct and i' suggest we vote on this
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
and then we can have the discussion on I
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
agree so yes I'll support the amendment
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative goul do you wish to speak
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
to your second no I think everything's
 
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.710 align:start position:0%
to your second no I think everything's
been

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
said okay anyone else have a comment on
 
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.430 align:start position:0%
said okay anyone else have a comment on
the

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
amendment okay so the motion is to adopt
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2436 H to House Bill
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
644 and the clerk can call the
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
RO representative Simon yes
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative lakus yes representative
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
Bailey yes representative santon naso

yes representative bom yes
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
representative Dunn yes representative

groa yes representative Schmidt yes
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes representative
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
sht yes representative O'Brien yes
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Davis yes representative
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick yes representative Gould yes
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes representative
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
manati yes and the chair yes 19 y z n
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay so we have adopted the amendment
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
and the representative lus so I'd like
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
to move um on House Bill 644 ought to
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
pass with
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
okay you we should speak to your motion
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
um okay I mean we we've uh talked about
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
this a lot when earlier um so we took
 
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
that out and what this this does is it
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
drops the requirement for license for um
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
the things that are called blow drying
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
for one that's shampooing conditioning
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
dying that kind of thing um makeup
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
application and the eyebrow threading um
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
but you still need to have a license to
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
do anything with chemicals dying
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
bleaching cutting anything where you got
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know sharp implements or any of that
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
um and you know my argument is New
 
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a greater training
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for a license to do this
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
sort of thing than most other states and
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
U you know the large cost in time and
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
expense to get a license is you know
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
particular burden on people that I mean
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
they may not be in a great economic
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
situation they're trying to get some
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
extra income they may have
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for taking care of kids
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever and I don't see any
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
justification for the state limiting
 
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
what people can do to earn a living
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
other than you know significant impact
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
on public health and safety and I you
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
know we've I know there's some there's
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
been some vague concerns I've heard but
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
but really I don't think any of these
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
pose any kind of significant risk um and
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
so I don't think there's a justification
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
for requiring a license and and it's not
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
just you know my idea on this um 40 of
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
the other states have an exemption for
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
some are all of these services including
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
all of our neighboring states and I
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of uh you know a rash of
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
bad things happening as a result um
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
you I've also heard concern raised that
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
you know letting people provide these
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
services without a license might put
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
them in a position where their customers
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
are going to ask them to do things that
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
would require license and they might
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
feel they need to yield to that and I
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
understand that but couple of things um
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
I mean people may can always break the
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
law whether it's this law or any
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
other and you know I don't see
 
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
justification in limiting the freedom or
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to earn living of people who
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
are following the law just because
 
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else might break it um yeah I
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
mean if you follow that logic you know
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
probably couldn't let people uh be
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
permitted to do much of anything um and
 
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
so I I don't see that as a um a
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate argument the other thing that
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is exemp makeup
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
application and and similar uh sorts of
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
things so it could be somebody doing a
 
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
demonstration at a department store or
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is you can have um
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know uh people come to shoot a movie
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
here they may want to use their own
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
makeup people uh same thing uh given
 
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
this season you have political
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
candidates come in and and they end up
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
getting makeup on before they end up on
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
TV and now if they want to use their own
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
people they have to go through the
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
trouble of getting licens in New
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know for what might be a
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
single appearance um and that doesn't
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
seem again like it's uh a significant
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement you know in public safety
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
because those people are work with and
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
are hired by you know whoever is getting
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
the services so that that doesn't seem
 
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
to make sense so anyway that's why I uh
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
I ask people to support aop pass uh with
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay represent gou do you
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second yes thank
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
you madam chair having attended
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
cosmetology school I know firsthand that
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
there is very little technical education
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
given on how to wash hair so uh I just
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
don't understand any reason why it would
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
require a licensed cosmetologist to wash
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
hair a friend of mine recently shared a
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
shampoo boy video clip which is a
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
humorous thing but um we ought to be
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
allowing people to enter the field and
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
do that um I believe it's still legal I
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
haven't researched this and I'm sure my
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues will correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
but I believe it's still legal in New
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to um to train at in bar
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
barbering and
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
cosmetology um under an apprenticeship
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
situation and so being allowed to
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
shampoo hair and do those kinds of
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
things is um an important way for an
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
apprentice to be able to earn a living
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
while they're learning and apprenticing
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
I think that it's really important for
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
um not only Workforce entry to allow
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
people opportunities to work that would
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
be denied we certainly heard from the
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
hairdressing salons that they're having
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
a hard time filling these positions and
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
so this would help them
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
but it also uh in my experience working
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
with the elderly there comes a point and
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
in hairdressing school we learned that
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
um there comes a point for elderly
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
people where washing your hair can be
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult and eventually you
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
have a nurse's aid who's coming into the
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
home to assist the elderly by allowing
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
blowout bars and
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
independent um facilities to be
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
established where the where the elderly
 
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
can go and have their hair done at a
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
more affordable cost because it's not
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
having requiring a license and all the
 
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
recruitments that go with it to wash
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's hair and blow dry it can
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
allow elderly especially women which is
 
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
my interest but it would be true for men
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
too to have um some dignity in the aging
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
process and continue to feel some
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
Independence and and important things so
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
for all those reasons I strongly support
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you okay I think
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has a question
 
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.789 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has a question
representative

00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
Schmid uh thank you madam chair so uh
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
I I don't disagree with what's been said
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
up to this point with regard to things
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
like shampooing and blow drying and and
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
styling and so forth I think that is um
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
I I I don't disagree with that the
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
problem I have is that the uh
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
aesthetician profession and and this spe
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we've heard
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
previously not today but previously with
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
regard to um the subject of eye makeup
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
or threading is I think a different
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
situation when you have people who may
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
have little to no training who may be
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
completely acceptable in terms of
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
washing hair uh styling hair blow drying
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on when you get them
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
monkey around with in the in the
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
immediate proximity of the eye which is
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
where the eyebrow is located it's right
 
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
where the eyebrow is located it's right
there

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh and hygiene is one of the things that
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
we've heard and I've been on this
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
committee for 17 years uh and we've
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
dealt with esthetician issues before and
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh and the idea that when you have
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
people who are uh untrained so it's not
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
a question of what representative leus
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
was referring to earlier where
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
um people can break the law yes they can
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
break the law about all kinds of things
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
things U to the degree that they
 
00:57:57.359 --> 00:57:58.829 align:start position:0%
things U to the degree that they
intentionally

00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
knowingly do something they steal they
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
harm a person intentionally
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
knowingly that we all recognize when you
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
do that you're taking the law on your
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
own hands and you should be treated
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
accordingly um in this and where but
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
where ignorance is involved uh and
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
hygiene is is in many cases a question
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
of ignorance uh people don't know uh the
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
we had a situation with a president many
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
years ago um President Garfield was shot
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh by a disappointed office
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
Seeker he died months later not from the
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
effect of the bullet I think it's widely
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
recognized not from the effect of the
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
bullet but the point that the that the
 
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians who came in to treat him
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
stuck their unwashed fingers
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
into the wound to probe for the
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
bullet they commonly recognize they they
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
infected President Garfield and he died
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
of the cause because of the infection
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
that the Physicians unknowingly but
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
ignorantly um so when you're dealing
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
eyes because you're going to be right
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
there if you're doing this threading
 
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:26.039 align:start position:0%
thing um or any other makeup application
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth there I think uh it's not a
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
question of knowingly violating the law
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
or or doing something unsafe they don't
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
know and if they don't have training
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
who's going to tell them so I I can't
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
support the bill because it allows
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
something that I think is inherently
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous so I will not be
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill as long as it has
 
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
got estheticians in there thank
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
so what are the education training
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
skills and competence of people how is
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
that going to be
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
measured representative
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
laas okay this uh section that's in here
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't think is specific
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
to you know a blow dry bar or or that
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
sort of thing because I mean it it
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't even that doesn't require a sh
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
shop license and it's interesting that
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
this got included in here but if
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
somebody does have a shop license then
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
they are you know then they're supposed
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
to uh be responsible for what happens in
 
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:16.039 align:start position:0%
there and you know for someone who is
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
doing what's permitted in here without a
 
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
license the things are pretty basic it
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
would be you know as was mentioned um
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
sanitation and that sort of thing and
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
that's something that you know the uh
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
salon owner is has got to be familiar
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
with so I mean it's it's very basic
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
things but they're still important
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
things so how do we make sure that
 
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.470 align:start position:0%
things so how do we make sure that
that's

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
done that's a responsibility of the
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
employer yeah however oplc enforcement
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
does it I assume if they go into a salon
 
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
they either get reports or there for
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
some other reason and notice that
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
there's things being done that people
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing or they're doing it
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know in a way that would endanger
 
01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
people they would take AC action but if
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
you're removing the licensing for people
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
who have blow drrive bars there's no
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
reason for oplc to go in there correct
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
in that case that's correct and my
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
argument is that the um the risk of
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
these things is low and that's not I
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
mean I understand that people can
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
imagine bad things happening um and it's
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
not just my you know panish view that
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
nothing bad is going to happen vast
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
majority of states are not requiring
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
licenses for this sort of thing and I
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of a rash of problems and
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
I think the threshold for acquiring a
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
license has got to be you know a a
 
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
really a a very real risk to public
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
health and safety and not something
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's is sort of theoretical or Could
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
Be Imagined um and so that's my take on
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
forther followup followup and then on
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
line just you know on on two comma b
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
line two blow dry styling includes the
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
use of and D so maybe you want to get
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
rid of that D where is this on it's uh
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
2B paragraph one 2B I don't have a
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
version oh ah okay what what again in
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
there is it includes the use and and I
 
01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:02.060 align:start position:0%
don't know what the g
 
01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.589 align:start position:0%
don't know what the g
[Music]

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
means St use use and styling of her um I
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
think that D in the following space or
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
prior one is extraneous and I'm hoping
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
that an enrolled as in enrollment that
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
would be fixed styling of hair
 
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
extensions that's not blow drying what
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
mean um I might defer to uh someone with
 
01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.789 align:start position:0%
mean um I might defer to uh someone with
more

01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
experience representative gold uh thank
 
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
you that would mean um like curling or
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh using the the brush on the hair
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
extension to get the style into it
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's consistent with washing and
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
blow drying but it's for not the natural
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
hair it's for the extension and it's
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
includes pinning them into place I
 
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.750 align:start position:0%
includes pinning them into place I
presume

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
presume
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
correct well there either pinned or
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
they're glued or they're threaded in but
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
it's not install excuse me Madam chair
 
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
can I follow up please follow up it's
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
not um discussing applying them it's
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
correctly I have no further questions
 
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
but I will not be supporting the bill
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
okay any represent gold
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
I just want to follow up on the
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
threading which I know has created a
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
great deal of concern among committee
 
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
some committee members and I studied it
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
extensively I had not heard of it I was
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
not trained in it and it hasn't been
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
historically a popular practice um in
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
the profession what it is is it's a
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
piece of cotton string and it gets wound
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
together in such a way that you're just
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
pulling the hair out with the string and
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
as someone who spins
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
yarn fibers uh frequently having hair
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
like this my hair gets caught up in the
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
fibers that I'm twisting and it it gets
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the yarn I'm creating
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what threading is it's
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
not getting anywhere near any uh open
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
tissue you're not sticking your finger
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
in somebody's eye You're simply taking a
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
cotton string and with a twisting of the
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
string your hands are way out far away
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
from the body the string captures a hair
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
and pull it out so I just wanted to
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
clarify on the threading because it's a
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
unique process that's not commonly
 
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
understood um
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
locally okay repres Mana
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair just uh couple
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
of comments one is regarding the
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
threading threading is a very popular uh
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
in South Asian in know growing up it's
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
it is it's not very close to the face
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
and it is uh exactly ly like
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative G uh explained it's and
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
it's also taught to do it for yourself
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not something that's
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
needs professional things so threading
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
is one just understanding renting a
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
booth for me it seems like the
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility is shifted to the person
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
who owns the booth if I'm just doing a
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
blow drying excuse me representative
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
maputi the booth rental items were
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
removed from the bill by the amendment
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
geard thank you madam
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
chair as far as getting close to
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
people's faces just a quick comment
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
concerned what about face painters at
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
carnival circus kind of things with they
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
getting close to especially children's
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
faces they're probably more susceptible
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
to issues I just I don't see the issue
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
here I mean I'm just reiterating things
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
I've already said previously so okay
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you that is a
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
concern anyone else have a comment
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
question Peter Pete representative
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you well I I certainly
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the discussion we've gotten
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
into because um I I know next to nothing
 
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
about threading and uh um I I not the
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of a beneficiary of uh of any
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
such treatments um I just yank them out
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
myself myself when it's a problem um but
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
but anyway the point is I'm appreciative
 
01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
of a little bit more instructor I I I do
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
understand that this is kind of an
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
started off any way as a somewhat of an
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
ethic ethnic practice that in certain
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
cultures it's a common thing to mess
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
around with your eyebrows for again
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
probably mostly for ladies um but to the
 
01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
degree that the makeup aspect and that
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
that is something where unless you're
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
using distinctive I don't mean
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
distinctive distinct um uh packets of
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
makeup or whatever for customer a then
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
everything gets thrown away and a new
 
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
set of stuff is opened up to be used on
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
the next customer there's always the
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
issue of contamination of makeup and so
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
forth and so on and representative geart
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
may be unconcerned about what happens
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
with people getting their faces their
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
children especially getting their face
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
pain painted I think if you get an eye
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
infection or especially um as a result
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
of it you'd be less sanguin about that
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm glad to know more but as long
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
as they're messing around with the eyes
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
I am not going to support this Bill
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
gold thank you Madam chair and thank you
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt for um for
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
sharing more about what your concerns
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
are and certainly having run programs
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
for teenage girls I dealt with don't
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
share your makeup as a concern for
 
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
infections and passing those kind of
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
things along in the profession you'll
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
find like in a hair salon when you buy a
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
bottle of a product you don't do one use
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
and toss the product you put the amount
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
you need need into another container out
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
of the main Supply and then you apply
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
from that so you can still apply the
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
makeup by by taking a small amount and
 
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
putting it in a separate little
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
container you can still be hygienic and
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
um I I just I agree with what
 
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative leus has said 40 other
 
01:09:45.789 --> 01:09:45.799 align:start position:0%
states allow it it's
 
01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
makeup though um clearly people want to
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
practice appropriate hygiene it it
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise to the level of Licensing
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and I I just wanted to
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
share that with you thank
 
01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:01.420 align:start position:0%
you anyone any other
 
01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.149 align:start position:0%

that and
 
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
I think we will take a 15minute break
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
since representative Boyd is not yet
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
here so we'll take we'll take a break
 
01:12:03.639 --> 01:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
here so we'll take we'll take a break
until

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
11:25 that will give representative Gro

many members of the committee know the
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh trials and tribulations I've gone
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
through in the last year and I guess if
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
I survive that I can go forward for many
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
today the speaker has not yet made an
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
official pronouncement so we don't know
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
who our 20th member will
 
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
be not the
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
only ref Schmid I would not attempt to
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
categorize what we don't
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
know it would would take too
 
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
long okay so House Bill 559
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative Simon you have a
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you madam chair I would
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
like to move um Amendment
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
246 for consideration by the
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee okay seconded by
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative leus do you wish to speak
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
to your motion uh yes thank you very
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
much um really the main uh the only real
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
change uh that this amendment brings if
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
the committee members want to look at
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
page three um starting in line 28 it
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
really should be bolded I think but it
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't so I'll call your attention to it
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
um it just deals with the contributions
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
by the employer uh when the bill
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
originally came around uh I believe it
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
was 2 and a half% that the uh employer
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
was going to kick into this defined
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
contribution plan uh and after further
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
discussion seemed like everybody who was
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
involved came to the conclusion that was
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
just far too small um and so uh an
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment's been brought forward to
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
raise that to a minimum of
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
5% um of the members earnable
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
compensation and uh we just thought that
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
that was a much more reasonable starting
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
place for discussion
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
so okay representative leus do you wish
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
to speak to your Amendment uh yes thank
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
you uh mam chair um you might well first
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
of all it's not bolded because this is a
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
whole new section and it's not the
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is against current law so
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
that's why it's not bolded and you might
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
it might look like it's uh this is
 
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
replacing a larger amount of text in the
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh original Bill and that's because the
 
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
original Bill
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
referenced uh the statute for the
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan for the employer
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
contribution in there and uh if you
 
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
follow that thread through it's two and
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
a half per. so actually if we were to
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment and this bill the
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
the uh employer which in this case is
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
the state U for their group one
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
employees would actually be uh doubling
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
the amount that they're paying towards
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
their retirement
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
um I know I've been in uh similar plans
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
in Private Industry through most most of
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
my career and uh my experience uh for
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of plan two and a half percent
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
is uh is just too low and
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know maybe it's too low for the
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan but that's a a
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh I mean defined benefit plan but
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's a a different discussion um so
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
that's the only change and everything
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
else in here is the same as uh when we
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
heard this bill earlier this
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
year okay thank
 
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have a comment on the
 
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um I am um
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to this entire bill and I sorry
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't think the amendment makes it
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
that much better to make it acceptable
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Bailey and
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
then vce
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
Patrick I guess might would be a
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
question for representative leakas
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
when they do this sort of thing don't
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.709 --> 01:32:01.719 align:start position:0%
it represent laus yes
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
um the reason that it's uh a what's the
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
exact language here um equal to or
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
greater than 5% so that that sets the
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
floor and um it leaves to the employer
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
the state in this case the uh the
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
ability to negotiate as part of the
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
whole you know contract negotiation
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
benefits package potentially a number
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
larger than that now you know ultimately
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
that spending would have to be approved
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
by the legislature um so I think I guess
 
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
the upper cap on that is is what the
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislature is willing and the governor
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
is willing to to spend um but at least
 
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
that left the flexibility that it could
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
be another item that was included in uh
 
01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
be another item that was included in uh
contract

01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
negotiation follow
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
up I guess what I mean is they might say
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
oh you can do this up to 10% of your
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
salary or something not not your whole
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
salary you know um representative leus
 
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
yeah in 41k programs usually what
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
they'll do is they'll have what's called
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
a match um and
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
so um the the employer will agree to
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
match up to some percentage I mean I I
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know for a while I was working some
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
place where it was 6% so they would
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
match up to 6% I could contribute more
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
than that up to some IRS limit um but in
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
this case this is not a match program
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
this is um the employer is going to
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
contribute this
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
amount um and then also um in the bill
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
so it would be in statute if it were to
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
pass is the amount that the employee
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
pays and right now for the defined
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
benefit program that's 7% I believe and
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
it would be the same with this so the
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
employee would be paying the same amount
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
and uh and this just addresses the
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
employer part but it's not the match
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
Dynamic where the amount the employer is
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to pay is based on the amount you
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Fitzpatrick are
 
01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment changes the employer
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
contribution from Two and a half to five
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
is that what yes it changes it from the
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
same as current group one which is two
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
and a half% two so and then flat 5% or
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
more so that's so that's just on the on
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself and then we will
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
vote on the overall bill later uh
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
I will support the amendment because
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
it's obviously Inc in increasing an
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
amount that I find is simply uh almost
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
embarrassing uh I won't support the
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
overall bill because I believe the 5% is
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
much too is much too low to be taking
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
away a defined benef benefit for a
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
defined contribution I I believe that it
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
it should be more than 5% %c I also want
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
to make a a case that the overall
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
concept is a very positive thing I
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
believe that uh these programs that
 
01:35:07.229 --> 01:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
evolved in the 1950s
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
basically uh when we were the only
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
economy in the functional economy in the
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
entire world after World War II and all
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
of everyone not everyone but many of our
 
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
constituents GE IBM you name that they
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
all had defined benefit plans they don't
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
have them
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and and I don't know how we can
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
justify to our our citizens that that
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
we're giving government in in employees
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
a benefit that is not uh offered to uh
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
our citizens in the private sector uh
 
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
however I do believe that that and the
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
other positive is that that that uh
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
these people can take their uh
 
01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
accumulated cont contributions with them
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
wherever wherever they uh go so I think
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
it's a positive but I think we have a
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
long way to uh uh go to make them fairer
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
and more attractive thank you madam
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
chair okay thank you I anyone
 
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
else I have uh two comments from the
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor who uh has a conflicting
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
committee from the sponsor who has a
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
commit conflicting committee meeting
 
01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:26.950 align:start position:0%
commit conflicting committee meeting
this

01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
morning the impetus for this came out
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
because he learned that fewer than half
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the state employees reached the
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
10year limit for
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
vesting and therefore the defined
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
contribution the defined benefit plan
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
was very disad disadvantageous to them
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
because they contributed while they were
 
01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:51.830 align:start position:0%
because they contributed while they were
working

01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the employer
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
contributions were not returned to them
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
when they
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
left as a fe they haven't reached the
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
point of investment correct but and like
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
I said more than half were not reaching
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
that point so it they were essentially
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
being used to bulk up the retirement
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
plan for the long-term employees which
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
he felt was unfair to the newer people
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
because they weren't getting any
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
employer match at all
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and secondly
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
the in in the
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
future Lord willing the retirement
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
system will pay off its unfunded
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
liabilities and the employer rates will
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
go down significantly due to paying off
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
the retirement at that point we have a
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
the employer rate must be at least as
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
much as the employee rate
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh which is not the case now as has been
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
commented the employer rate is much
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
higher on paper because that's the
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability the actual
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
contribution to the pension is less is
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
is only about a third as much as the
 
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
employees are put in so we're expecting
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
the the employee contribution to be
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted downward in the future to make
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
it more fair and that should apply to
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
this as well representative gold thank
 
01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:25.159 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and I apologize to you
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
if this question is um out of context
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
but I heard you mention um the
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
unfunded portion getting paid off in the
 
01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
future and so I just wanted to ask uh
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
the H Haner New Hampshire selectman
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
asked me to uh pay attention to the cost
 
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
for the towns for um for these matters
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that there's something
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill that would lower the cost
 
01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.229 align:start position:0%
in this bill that would lower the cost
for

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
employers no okay there is something in
 
01:38:58.639 --> 01:39:00.030 align:start position:0%
employers no okay there is something in
current

01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
law that says that the employers are
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for the unfunded liability
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
which is a basic part of a defined
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
benefit plan and that will happen
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether we pass this bill
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
or not thank you madam chair and This
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
only affects state employes EMP es so
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
that there is no cost or there's no
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
change to any of the local
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
employers anyone else represent broa
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so um as you know this
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee did a lot of work on House
 
01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:38.629 align:start position:0%
committee did a lot of work on House
Bill

01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
436 and as a result of the conversation
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
that we had between the Senate and the
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
house on House Bill 436 there was an a
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
commission formed or committee to look
 
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
at the retirement benefits and that is
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
something that's ongoing and I am not
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
going to support this bill because I'm
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
going to wait and see what the
 
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
retirement commission recommends and
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
I'll be attending that meeting tomorrow
 
01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.229 align:start position:0%
I'll be attending that meeting tomorrow
thank

that's it's as far as I can tell the
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
commission is not considering this sort
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
of a plan very seriously but it has
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
certainly been brought up in its on and
 
01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:21.470 align:start position:0%
certainly been brought up in its on and
it's

01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
scope yes repesent gold just one last
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%

to speak to your motion um yeah I'll
 
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion um you know there's
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
already been some Lively discussion
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
today and obviously the last time we had
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
um this bill before us um and to
 
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
representative hes Patrick's um comments
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
earlier I I feel that um there there is
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
a great deal of benefit to be considered
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at a defined
 
01:43:11.709 --> 01:43:11.719 align:start position:0%
contribution plan as opposed to a
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan um and we'd have to
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
get into probably a fairly lengthy
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
discussion to cover all those topics
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
again today um but for me right now of
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
the more compelling points on the table
 
01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh is that such a large number of the
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
EMP employees in this particular pool um
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about group two we're
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
not even talking about teachers in group
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
one we're just talking about state
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
employees in group one and in that pool
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
of people um the vast majority of them
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
aren't reaching investment which means
 
01:43:42.589 --> 01:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
that they're not getting anything out of
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
their retirement plan and um you know
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the argument as to
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not the defined benefit plan
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
is helping with retention which is
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
another thing that we're giving
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
consideration to if the vast majority of
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
those new hires aren't reaching vestment
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
um that means that they're not hanging
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
in there very long um and then those
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
people are walking away with no benefit
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
at all and so the thing that's
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
compelling me at the moment is seems to
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
me if you stick around for three years
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
5% of your salary is a whole lot more
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
than 0% of your salary if you stick
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
around for five years you know um 5% of
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
five years of your salary is a great
 
01:44:17.229 --> 01:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
deal more than uh 0% and so forth and so
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
on all the way up to 9 years of your
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
salary you could stay for 9 years and
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
not get any benefit if you're not vested
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and so you know this the main reason
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
why uh although I know there's
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
discussion on whether the 5% is is
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
enough or not uh this bill does not
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
actually technically limit it to 5% uh
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature can always change that
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
if it decides that more is necessary um
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
but I just think the upside of this
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
legislation um is more than the down the
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
potential downside of the legislation so
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's why I'll be supporting it
 
01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.189 align:start position:0%
uh that's why I'll be supporting it
today

01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative leus uh thank
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
you um so to address some things that
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
were raised I mean I understand wanting
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
more money uh 10% would be great but
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
first of all this is twice what the
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
employers are currently you know the
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
state's currently uh
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
contributing to uh uh the employees
 
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.030 align:start position:0%
contributing to uh uh the employees
retirement

01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
and you know while there may be
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
companies that offer that I know in the
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
Private Industry I'm I've never worked
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
for one not aware of one that offers um
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
some offer a little more than 5% I
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of one that does 10% um so
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
you know we could argue about just what
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
what it should be but that seems a
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
High um and as the chair said if if uh
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully the uh unfunded liability gets
 
01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
paid off this whole thing can be looked
 
01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.750 align:start position:0%
paid off this whole thing can be looked
at

01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
and um you know the employee
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
contribution could could go down the the
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
employer contribution could go up uh
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
there'd be space for that um given that
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability wasn't being
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
being paid for at that time but as
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative Simon said a big thing
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
for me is that you know with this plan
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
as soon as the money is put in either by
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
the employee or the employer that money
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
belongs to the it's the property of the
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
employee as well as any gains um that
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
that uh are developed they become the
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
property immediately of the
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
employee I know I don't know if there's
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
an LSR but I know there's been
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
discussion about reducing the vesting
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
periods I've heard numbers like 5 years
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what percentage of the
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
employees leave before 5 years but I
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
know it's even there it's substantial I
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
just don't know the number uh but that
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
issue goes away um with a defined
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
contribution plan because once the
 
01:46:39.589 --> 01:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
contributions in it belongs the
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
employee um I mean you know you can
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
think of all the possible things that
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
might happen in the future but um
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
historically I'm not sure there's a
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
40-year period or almost no 40-year
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
period in the history of of the the
 
01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.109 align:start position:0%
period in the history of of the the
country

01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
where um you know the gain from you know
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
a defined contribution plan where it's
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
invested in in uh just the market uh
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
would not leave you better off than the
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan and um I know for
 
01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:13.719 align:start position:0%
me and some other people if IID had the
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
option of uh of uh you know putting my
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
money into a defined contribution plan
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
or Define yeah contribution plan rather
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
than Social Security I certainly would
 
01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
have jumped on it and um and looking at
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
history I would be in a a much better
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
position if that were the case um so and
 
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
and the thing is the stock market can go
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
down things can happen but um you know
 
01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
retirement savings is retiring for the
 
01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.790 align:start position:0%
retirement savings is retiring for the
long

01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
term um and then there's concern about
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
employees not being Savvy enough to do a
 
01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
good job investing um you know the the
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh 401K type programs I'm familiar with
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
they generally have and this one uh I'm
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
not sure about the 43b but there's a
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
default um investment which has a mix of
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh well you know things like stocks and
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
bonds or long-term things and shorter
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
term things and that mix changes as the
 
01:48:14.589 --> 01:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
employees age changes and so that when
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
you get close to retirement they're put
 
01:48:19.589 --> 01:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
into uh Investments that are less likely
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
to be affected by an economic
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
downturn um but might have lower uh
 
01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
returns and so you you really want
 
01:48:29.950 --> 01:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
higher returns earlier in your investing
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
period than later so you know I think
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
you know and I ended up having a long
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
discussion with the state employee union
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
people uh you know I just see this as
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
all around a much better deal for the
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
state employees um and I I uh I didn't
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
use the word um embarrassing as the two
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
two and a half% that we're currently
 
01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
contributing uh but I I would agree with
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
that um and this would double that um
 
01:49:04.109 --> 01:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
and move it up into at least um you know
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
within the reasonable range of what uh
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
industry offers some are a little more
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
some a little less I know ones that do a
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
3% match I worked for one place for
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
quite a while that did a
 
01:49:18.189 --> 01:49:18.199 align:start position:0%
6% um again I haven't heard of a 10 um
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
but um I just think this is um you
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
know the best thing we can do as far as
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
Retirement for the employees so thank
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
you represent Simon thank you madam
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair I I do believe the 403b plan has
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
of well representative representative
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
gold let's get some other
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
people's represent thank you madam chair
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
if representative leus has an immediate
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
response oh mine's a different
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to explain what the 403b
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
plan is that is a a defined contribution
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
plan that's optional uh for state
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
employees there's no employer match or
 
01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
no employer contribution but it's a a
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
tax advantage investment uh offering for
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
employees and uh uh that's been in place
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
for a long time that's the four 457 I'm
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
sorry no I think it was
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
RSA well I may be wrong never mind yeah
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
no but there is a state plan that lets
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
employees contribute um pre-tax for the
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
retirement and it does offer um you know
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
the kind of an option that uh adjusts to
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
your age and does the right thing and
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
the employee doesn't have to care about
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
it yes but it it does not include any
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
employer match correct okay represent
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
gold on a new topic thank you thank you
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I just wanted to state
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
that uh having worked for the state for
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
and not ever being vested um I can
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate the benefits that this
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
amendment would bring and if I were
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
doing my typical very independent voting
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
my own mind I I would likely support
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
this however I've heard from a great
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
many of my constituents that they are
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
not in support of this and um and from
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
my colleagues here in the committee who
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
who um understand these matters better
 
01:51:20.430 --> 01:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
than I do so I will not be voting for
 
01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:23.719 align:start position:0%
but not based on my own personal opinion
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you okay anyone else have a
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
comment representative sh it thank you
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
madam chair um as I stated before I have
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
not been in support of this bill all
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
along uh to me this is basically the
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
state saying that they are encouraging
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
their employees to look elsewhere for
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
employment and I think that's the wrong
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
direction action for the state to take
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
um I would also point out that um I'm a
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
little suspect as to the assurances that
 
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure at the retirement
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
system that supports current employees
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
would not be damaged by this uh sorry
 
01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
but I'm not trusting that and I think it
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
does nothing as we've stated to relieve
 
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
the unfunded
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
liability uh as repres representative
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
goul says I've heard from many uh
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
retirees and current
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
employees that they do not embrace the
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
tenants of this plan because it assigns
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
all investment risk to them they would
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
bear the responsibility for paying all
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
their health care
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
premiums and they already have the
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
Deferred Compensation Plan to add to
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
their retirement system plan if they so
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
choose uh I just think that that this
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
plan erodes whatever trust current
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
employees have left in our government
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
entities as
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
employers and would result in even less
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
interest in working for the state thank
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
you okay represent black thank you just
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
a couple notes one is
 
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
um for the employees that move from the
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
defined benefit to the defined
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
contribution plan it does still require
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
the employer to pay
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
um what their contribution would be to
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
pay off the past unfunded liability so I
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
understand there's other concerns but at
 
01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
least in this that regard it still does
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
protect um the current pension system um
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is M someone can
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe
 
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
that the uh the current retirement
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
medical plan is one that's an optional
 
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
thing and it's fully funded by the
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
employees and this bill would permit the
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
employees in the defined contribution
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
plan to be part of that if they choose
 
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
still so there's no change there I I
 
01:53:56.189 --> 01:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
don't believe
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
01:54:02.109 --> 01:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
else all right in that case the motion
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass with Amendment on House
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 559 and the clerk can call the
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%

101 108 10 n okay not
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
unexpected uh that will go without
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation the minority
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be itl I presume
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay Representatives Simon you have
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
a committee report in favor of L to pass

with Amendment and who will be doing the
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
r well put me down for it we'll figure
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%

01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
much thank you mad exactly it's been
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's been a slog uh there are quite a
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
lot of bills that or lsrs that look like
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
they might be headed our way if you
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
would uh devote your copious free time
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
in the late in December to looking at
 
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
the one at at them once they come out as
 
01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:08.679 align:start position:0%
bills if you can identify any that
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
are poised to go to Edna that you just
 
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
as rather not or think they shouldn't be
 
01:56:16.109 --> 01:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
I'll try and get them vacated to
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
somebody else and um otherwise
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
read up on them because it's going to be
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%

tying for a second time in a
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
row un it shows that your constituents
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
really are
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
everye matter and the thing is madam
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
chers I don't think they're they're
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
split you know ideologically they want
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
both of us
 
01:57:33.629 --> 01:57:33.639 align:start position:0%
oh that's the problem that's a challenge
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
to implement yeah yeah and and for your
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
planning purposes uh we will be meeting
 
01:57:42.669 --> 01:57:42.679 align:start position:0%
on Wednesdays and some Thursdays next
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
week with Fridays and
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
Mondays possible but not not likely oh
 
01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.229 align:start position:0%
Mondays possible but not not likely oh
you

01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
say no no no end next year starting in
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
January we'll be meeting Wednesdays for
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
sure Thursdays when we don't have
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
session and possibly Mondays or Fridays
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
although I will try not to need
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
them those of us who've been around for
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
a long time remember a radio program
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
called the
 
01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
shadow um and so representative Gro has
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
not learned to Cloud men's or women's
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
mind so that they cannot see her so I
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
noticed that she came in and placed a
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
carton of some something on the table
 
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm a little bit curious we are
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
celebrating representative shu's
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
survival to another year
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
ah with Grace and and
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
honor and and it's a nice way to end our
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
say
