in the room
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh during the meeting which is required
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
under the right to not know for
 
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
inexplicable reasons
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
part of the editorialism
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
okay the subcommittee is representative
 
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
mcguire president of the committee room
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's a very interesting question i'm
 
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh we do have other members of committee
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
presence representative
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's fine with me because as they
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
said we are not taking a vote but we i
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
would like to achieve consensus if
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
to the extent that that's possible i
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
think we can i think
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
the reason we're not taking about is
 
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a final amendment and
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we will need a
 
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
complete amendment for senate bill 133
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
but if we agree on what this section of
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment want to say it'll make
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
pam's job in stitching the pieces
 
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.310 align:start position:0%
pam's job in stitching the pieces
together

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
but let's do one thing at a time
the

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.909 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:00.830 align:start position:0%
um
they

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
mr porter and
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
going looking at part seven
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
section two you've inserted the uh
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
standing orders
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
is that correct that i i i'm just not
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
familiar enough
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
part seven section two yep um um hold on
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
just a second
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of representative
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
schuett and schmidt why don't you please
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
explain what you have put in here
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
because it's technical but they i want
 
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
them to understand
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure and um just for clarity would you
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
like me to go through all the changes
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
the changes as requested by the
 
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.869 align:start position:0%
the changes as requested by the
subcommittee

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
last meeting plus what we've added or
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
i want you uh first that's uh a
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
wonderful suggestion i wish i had
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
thought of it
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes except for the very last two
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
that you inserted with word i'll i'll
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
talk about them separately okay
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
so first um
 
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.589 align:start position:0%
so first um
if

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
on of the word document well part seven
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
we added in a new section two on
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
standing orders to amend our general
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
statute 310 a1d
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
to insert a new subsection saying all
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
board councils and commissions may issue
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
standing orders delegating
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
non-discretionary tasks to staff at the
 
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
non-discretionary tasks to staff at the
oplc

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
the reason for this actually came about
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
due to a
 
00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:52.310 align:start position:0%
due to a
ongoing

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
audit of the dental board and i'm not
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure how much detail i can give here but
 
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.470 align:start position:0%
sure how much detail i can give here but
um

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
just by way of background
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
some of our boards or many of our boards
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
have um issued
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
standing orders to
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
allow staff
 
00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:09.750 align:start position:0%
allow staff
to

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
licenses if they if if certain criteria
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
are met
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
in between meetings and so
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
if it if uh
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
applic if a profession requires is their
 
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:24.710 align:start position:0%
applic if a profession requires is their
licensure

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.630 align:start position:0%
um just
uh

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know what to say to say a list
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
of non-discretionary things um like you
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
need to have graduated from an
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
accredited school in dental
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
and you need to pay the fee and
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
you need to submit your resume
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
if those criteria are met the boards
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
issued a standing order saying staff may
 
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.670 align:start position:0%
issued a standing order saying staff may
um

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
give a license to the individual in
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
between a board meeting so that those
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
that individual doesn't need to wait
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
another 30 days to get their license
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
for the board to review the application
 
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
for the board to review the application
um

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then there's a carve out that says
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
if anything um
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
if any of the following are found on the
 
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
if any of the following are found on the
application

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.509 align:start position:0%
application
um

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
the administrator forwards this to the
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
board and it gets reviewed at the next
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
board meeting and we lay out there uh if
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
the person has a criminal record if they
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:22.470 align:start position:0%
have any
um

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.710 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
uh
any

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
action taken by a board in another state
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
really the board can set the parameters
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
there um
 
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.949 align:start position:0%
there um
so

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
we have had some boards do this uh at a
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
recent recent audit the dental or the
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
dental board audit the lba auditor
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
suggested that the board may not have
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
the authority to do that and had
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that if they wanted to do that
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
they may need to say seek um legislative
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
change so
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
we threw this in where we we
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully put this i should say um
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
because we found that that's very
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
helpful the boards um like it it lets
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
people get license quicker
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
and just notice it it still is up to the
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
board it's that the board may issue the
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
standing order we have some boards that
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
have said we want to keep seeing all the
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
applications um
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
it is something that has been helpful i
 
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.389 align:start position:0%
it is something that has been helpful i
think

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
both administratively and to the public
 
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.030 align:start position:0%
both administratively and to the public
um

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
mr broderick before i uh comment on that
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
i i have a question but i want to
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
welcome representative o'brien and i
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
reckon i know that representative
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
schmidt has his hand up and we'll get to
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
that in a second
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
let me make absolutely clear this has
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with policy this has to do
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
with are the boxes checked
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
and the may
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
issue the standing orders implies that
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
they may revoke the standing orders
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
correct um so to your first point we
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
have some boards that require
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
for their initial license some
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
subjective requirements so actually an
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
example is uh psychology i see dr warner
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
is here
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
psychology has um
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
essay questions that need to be well not
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
graded need to be reviewed by the board
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
so for psychology they really can't do
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
this specific standing order at this
 
00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:16.069 align:start position:0%
this specific standing order at this
time

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
but other boards
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
checking the box do they have this
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
education have they paid the fee um
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
and if those
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
requirements are met
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
by checking the box i mean there's no um
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
this is i'm i'm emphasizing it's
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
non-discretionary this is they jump
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
through the hoop or not
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
correct yep now you mentioned in what
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
you just said
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
that there was a carve out and i don't
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
see that in section two where is this
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
carve out that you said
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
that they could wait till the next
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
meeting whatever um well
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
the carve out is in the way we draft up
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
the standing orders so
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
um i actually have one if the committee
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
would like to see a
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
an example i have one up because i was
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
just discussing this with a different
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
board um
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
but we draft them
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
like this specific standing order we
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
draft to say
 
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.150 align:start position:0%
draft to say
um

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
here are
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
where the board
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
can issu the board can issue the license
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
if if the general requirements are met
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
but if the application
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
contains any of the following
 
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.350 align:start position:0%
contains any of the following
um

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
the administrator hangs on to that
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
application and brings it to the next
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
board meeting and so i meant that's what
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
i meant to the carve out so it will say
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
if the application shows that they have
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
any criminal record it gets
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
um it gets brought to the board's next
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
meeting if the person has a record from
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction a board in any other
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction it gets brought to the next
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
board meeting
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
um and it really allows the board to um
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
the exact constraints of when they want
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
to see it and when they're okay with the
 
00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
to see it and when they're okay with the
administrator

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.670 align:start position:0%
administrator
um

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
issuing it so the short take is that if
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
all the boxes cannot be checked it's got
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
to be kicked back and that's part of the
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
standing order correct okay
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative schmidt
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i will turn on
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
my camera
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
so tom when you began you said may issue
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering uh
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
whether there's any distinction between
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
i mean are we talking about renewal of
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
licenses only or are we talking about
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
people as well who might be brand new
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned several things
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
that uh that one would
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
assume have would not be uh applicable
 
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.310 align:start position:0%
assume have would not be uh applicable
for

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.509 align:start position:0%
for
renewals

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
renewals
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
that in that criminal background
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
issues and so forth uh obviously
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
somebody can get in trouble even if
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
they're already licensed but so are we
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
anybody or just renewals here
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
so the the wording we proposed in in
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
what is in front of the subcommittee is
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
broad and would allow any um
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
non-discretionary matter to be um
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be in a standing order delegated to
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
the board's administrator
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so a board could choose to say
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
just initial applications
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
this standing order only applies to
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
initial applications or the standing
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
order only applies to renewals
 
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.230 align:start position:0%
order only applies to renewals
the

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
the boards that have implemented this
 
00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.110 align:start position:0%
the boards that have implemented this
process

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh i believe they all say for initial
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
licenses for renewals and for
 
00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:43.350 align:start position:0%
licenses for renewals and for
reinstatements

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
reinstatements
 
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.350 align:start position:0%
reinstatements
um

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay that that it was just uncertain in
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
my mind i and uh by good morning by the
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
way thank you so
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chair
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt we're glad to
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
hear your good for the moment there will
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
be more moments
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh please go on tom
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
so the next change in what we had sent
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
over is to
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
let's see they're on page one so it's
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
part seven the original section two i
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
did not go through and renumber the
 
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.509 align:start position:0%
did not go through and renumber the
sections

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
um so 310 a1h1
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
this was requested by the subcommittee
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
we deleted that in consultation with and
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
we added in when requested by so instead
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
of saying in consultation
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
with the board the
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
office shall assign an investigator it
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
says when requested by the board the
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
office yeah hold on a second that it was
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
not that wasn't what we had talked about
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
as i recall that's something uh
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's one of the later
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
changes no that's something we talked
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
it was obvious
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
and clear that it was the board deciding
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
that they wanted an investigator from
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
the office rather than some other
 
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.590 align:start position:0%
the office rather than some other
process

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what that was what that
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
language was
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
was to address so okay uh but uh and the
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee doesn't know this there is
 
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.990 align:start position:0%
subcommittee doesn't know this there is
a

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
in your word
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee understand you don't see
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
this yet i'll get to it uh you had a an
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
additional change and i'm confusing that
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the distinction between the
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
additional change and the change we
 
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.190 align:start position:0%
additional change and the change we
requested

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
yes and i actually don't have that
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
document to open up but i can if you
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
want to go through that because
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you what that's not what i
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
want to talk about at the moment but
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
let's look at this
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
you have the wording when in the court
 
00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.029 align:start position:0%
you have the wording when in the court
uh

00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
you have eliminated in consultation with
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
and replaced it with when requested by
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
the board the office shall assign an
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
investigator comma
 
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.110 align:start position:0%
investigator comma
uh

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
that is hanging and i think it needs
 
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.029 align:start position:0%
that is hanging and i think it needs
something

00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
it's going to need some polishing up
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
like this while suggests something like
 
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.430 align:start position:0%
like this while suggests something like
this

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
when requested by the board and to the
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
extent exten requested by the board the
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
office shall assign an investigator who
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
may assist in the investigation
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
does that sound all right to you
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'm looking mostly for uh the fact that
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with that uh
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
mike is our um
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
is an enforcement unit so i just want to
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
make sure he has the opportunity to
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
chime in
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
all right good morning mike speak please
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody thank you so i i
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
think instead of the comma i think that
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be just a period and a
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
hard stop um and i think the intent of
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
um to clearly leave the designation by
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
the board that if they request it that
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
we shall provide it um and i think that
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
it was instead of a comma it just should
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
be a period with a hard stop
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay do you have any object i
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
even with a hard stop it seems to be
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
slightly awkward sense do you have any
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
objection to the wording that i proposed
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
nope i i think it still meets i
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely still think it meets the
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
intent so no i don't
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you uh all right having
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
so subcommittee uh you've heard uh
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard the gist of what we've
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
talked about this is mostly
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
what i view about 99 100 grammar
 
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:51.190 align:start position:0%
what i view about 99 100 grammar
style

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
style
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
please go on tom
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
directly under that i added a new
 
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.950 align:start position:0%
directly under that i added a new
provision

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.710 align:start position:0%
provision
1a

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
1a
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
and this was i think the main concern of
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
stating the procedures set forth in 310
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
a1h through 310 a1l are supplementary
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
and shall not supplant or supersede any
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
procedures expressly set forth in any
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
board's individual practice act
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think that was the the main issue that
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
i agree with that mr chair and that was
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
one of the issues i had brought up that
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
i had trouble with and i'm glad to see
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh okay tom
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
proceed please sure thing and i'm my son
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
just got up so you might hear him in the
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
background i can go upstairs if i need
 
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.149 align:start position:0%
background i can go upstairs if i need
to

00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
the the bottom of that same page
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
subsection 4 of 310 a1h
 
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.110 align:start position:0%
subsection 4 of 310 a1h
um

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
here was where the subcommittee wanted
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
some clarification on um when a board
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
can disclose information to law
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and health licensing
 
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
enforcement and health licensing
agencies

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.630 align:start position:0%
agencies
um

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i added in
 
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.470 align:start position:0%
so i added in
um

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
may disclose information acquired in an
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
investigation to law enforcement if it
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
involves suspected criminal activity
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
and that's all i added and then it goes
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
on to help licensing agencies in this
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
state or any other jurisdiction
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
or in response to specific statutory
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think that meets the sub i know that
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
meets the subcommittee's object or
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
concern unless the subcommittee or
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
other members of our committee have
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
something to say i'd like to ask time to
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
move on
 
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.950 align:start position:0%
move on
okay

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
no hands
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
look mom no hands no
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
next uh next please um the next one was
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
very minor the next top and next page
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
subsection six it used to say the board
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
may dismiss a complaint it now says each
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
board made us
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
miss a complaint and i believe this was
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
to uh representative goalie's concern
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
just for clarity
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh i think you're right and you said
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
next one is section
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
7 below
 
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
7 below
um

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
and if you could
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
just give me one minute my son is
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
downstairs now so i want to move
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere with less noise
 
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.950 align:start position:0%
somewhere with less noise
um

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
subsection seven dealt with uh
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
when the board can take non-disciplinary
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.350 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:58.470 align:start position:0%
that the
individual

00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
tom can you you froze up there for a
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
second and your speech was blocked as
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
well can you repeat the last second
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chair
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
before we move on all right go ahead
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
i think i'll just go back briefly tom on
 
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
i think i'll just go back briefly tom on
six

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
roman 06 the each board that we changed
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
to each board
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
i just have a quick question because
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
underneath it the way the boards are
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
defined and that's what i
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
explained was i thought was different is
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
it says boards
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
which shall include all boards councils
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
and commissions
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
and that was the language i was looking
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
for i don't know if that is just a
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
technical change or if it if we're okay
 
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.909 align:start position:0%
technical change or if it if we're okay
with

00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
do you see what i'm talking about if you
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
look right below that
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
i think do so it was drafted um
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
that each
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh the beginning of section two
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see 310 it this is creating a new
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
chapter 310 a1h
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
and subsection 1 begins by saying boards
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
which shall include all boards councils
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
and commissions
 
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.430 align:start position:0%
and commissions
so

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
um and and the
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
provision we had talked about that we
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
changed each board
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
is in that
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
chapter or in that
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
subsection in 310 a1h
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
my read of it is that in subsection one
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
we're defining boards broadly is all
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
boards councils and commissions
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
and then in subsection six we're saying
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
each board which means
 
00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:38.710 align:start position:0%
each board which means
each

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
all boards councils and commissions
 
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.470 align:start position:0%
all boards councils and commissions
um

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
so
that's

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
why i changed it to just this but i'm
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
happy to further work on that if need be
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if it should stay
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
consistent in wording throughout the
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
i think you can achieve that
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
consistency by capitalizing the b
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
actually i tend to agree with tom that
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
in this section you define boards once
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
and then all the rest of the language
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
except in paragraph four
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
it says the office or the board's
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
councils and commissions
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm sit going along with
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
then you might as well stick the uh
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
council's commissions and so forth into
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
all right i'm happy to do that
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
so much
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
so subsection seven uh
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
this i would change to add upon making
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
an affirmative finding and then i added
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
after notice and an opportunity for
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
hearing the board counsel or commission
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
may take non-disciplinary remedial
 
00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:24.630 align:start position:0%
may take non-disciplinary remedial
action

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and this was to um
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee was concerned that it
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't didn't clearly state that they
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity for a hearing if the
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
board's going to take this action so we
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
objections or
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
questions please proceed
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
all right and then
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
the next change that you'll see in front
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
of you is
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
um i added in a subsection eight
 
00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.590 align:start position:0%
um i added in a subsection eight
um

00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
directly underneath that says
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
all proceedings for non-disciplinary
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
remedial action shall be exempt from the
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
provisions of rsa 91a
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
except that the board may disclose any
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
final remedial action that affects the
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
status of a license including any
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary restrictions imposed
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
to explain this this was not something
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
that the subcommittee had
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh requested
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
when i went through this again
 
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.310 align:start position:0%
when i went through this again
um

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
i believed this was missing uh
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
the only board right now that has this
 
00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:40.149 align:start position:0%
the only board right now that has this
um

00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
this option to take non-disciplinary
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
remedial action is the board of medicine
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe they found it helpful uh
 
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.669 align:start position:0%
and i believe they found it helpful uh
if

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
if someone is does not have the mental
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
capacity temporarily or or permanently
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
to practice anymore they can take
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine any hearing on those
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
matters would contain a lot of sensitive
 
00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:06.549 align:start position:0%
matters would contain a lot of sensitive
um

00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
medical psychological information
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so the board of medicine statute
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
has this provisions basically saying the
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
hearing's closed to the public um
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
any full order would be closed to the
 
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.830 align:start position:0%
any full order would be closed to the
public

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
um however the board will make public
 
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
um however the board will make public
that

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh like the disciplinary or the
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
actions the restrictions that the board
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
put on the license um
 
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.230 align:start position:0%
put on the license um
i

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
thought we had missed putting that in
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me yeah
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the idea is the
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary part of keeping this
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
confidential for the reasons tom said
 
00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:49.669 align:start position:0%
confidential for the reasons tom said
this

00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'brien uh
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
well let's let's move on and if anybody
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
has an objection i will listen or
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
concern uh
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
please proceed tom
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
sure the next change um was a very
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
simple one on page four
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
subsection three of 310 a1k
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
there was just a typo it had said
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
sections um
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
prior to imposing any sections i changed
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
that to sanctions
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think there will be any concerns
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that that was it in what i
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
originally had sent to the board
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
or to the subcommittee i'm sorry
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh i think the subcommittee has
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
heard that and i'd like to bring up what
 
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.310 align:start position:0%
heard that and i'd like to bring up what
uh

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
some helpful developments there have
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
been some reason like within the past 48
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
hours developments that
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
i have not really been privy to i've
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
just learned about them myself
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
and they were i believe instituted or
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
discovered by
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
dr warner
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask tom to comment on
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
those they fall into two categories
 
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
one are
 
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.350 align:start position:0%
one are
[Music]

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
helpful

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
elimination of redundancies or
 
00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:16.870 align:start position:0%
elimination of redundancies or
clarifications

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
clarifications
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
the other is has to do with uh from what
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
i understand and i don't know this
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
has to do with disciplinary
 
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.029 align:start position:0%
has to do with disciplinary
uh

00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
her suggestions she made with respect to
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary
 
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.430 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary
procedure

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
now in the course of that
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
it became clear that the
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
border psychologists and
 
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.710 align:start position:0%
border psychologists and
psychology

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
and the medical board have different med
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
have different disciplinary proceedings
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
oplc has no issue
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
with the substance of
 
00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.310 align:start position:0%
with the substance of
the

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
how a disciplinary hearing is done but
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
it does have a concern about
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's the general desire of keeping all
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
of the disciplinary proceedings as
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
uniform as possible to promote
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency and consistency
 
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.990 align:start position:0%
efficiency and consistency
so

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
i would like tom first to discuss the
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
ones that i'll call that are
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
basically uh
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
that are the cleanup
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
sure thing and um
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.669 align:start position:0%
sure thing and um
just

00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
to add to that explanation after i had
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
sent the subcommittee our draft on
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
monday or friday
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
i don't remember when i sent my copy
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
doctor i had provided it to dr warner
 
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
and she helpfully provided some feedback
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
as well so some of the changes she had
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
provided to us we had disagreed with um
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
respectfully but um
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
she did helpfully find out
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
two or three other issues
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
and they're all
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
fairly minor um
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
but they're important so
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
again going back to page one so
 
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.509 align:start position:0%
again going back to page one so
uh

00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
310a1h1 this is related to the other
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
change um
 
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.430 align:start position:0%
change um
the

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
we had changed it from in consultation
 
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.070 align:start position:0%
we had changed it from in consultation
with

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
with the board the office shall assign
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
an investigator
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
we'd change it to when requested by the
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
board the office shelter inside an
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
investigator it originally had continued
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
who shall complete the investigation in
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
accordance with rules adopted by the
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.230 align:start position:0%
executive director
um

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh dr warner helpfully pointed out that
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
change to state that
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
these procedures are supplementary
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
and don't supplant individual boards
 
00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:46.630 align:start position:0%
and don't supplant individual boards
procedures

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's no longer correct to say that
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
if an investigator is appointed they
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
need to follow
 
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
need to follow
the

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
rules adopted by the executive director
 
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
rules adopted by the executive director
so

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're proposing we can just eliminate
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
that last clause and i understand
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative scitec that you would
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
like um some additional language to sort
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
of finish off that clause
 
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
of finish off that clause
okay

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.549 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
what i did early in our first you may
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
recall i conflated the fact that there
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
were two changes made here one we
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
requested as a subcommittee the other
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
pointed out by uh dr warner but they
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
were you we've addressed them both at
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay
 
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay
uh

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
the next uh
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
next change please
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
sure the the next change uh that dr
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
warner had pointed out is on page well
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
involves page two and page three so
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
subsection four on page two that's three
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
ten a one i subsection 4
 
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.029 align:start position:0%
ten a one i subsection 4
and

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
top of page 3 310a1j1
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
so the first section began by saying
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings shall be opened
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
to the public then it continues final
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
board actions
 
00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:08.550 align:start position:0%
board actions
um

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
it goes on but it says disciplinary
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings shall be opened at the
 
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
proceedings shall be opened at the
public

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
if you scroll down 310 a1j
 
00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:17.829 align:start position:0%
if you scroll down 310 a1j
one

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
begins by saying disciplinary
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
proceedings shall be opened to the
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
public comma except upon order by the
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
board counsel or commission upon good
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
cause shown
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.190 align:start position:0%
cause shown
so

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
my recommendation to deal with this
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
confliction is to
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
get rid of the first sentence um that
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
simply says dislike disciplinary
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
proceedings shall be open to the public
 
00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:45.430 align:start position:0%
proceedings shall be open to the public
um

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
the more specific one should stand which
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
allows the board
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
in limited circumstances to close
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
a hearing or portions of the hearing
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
and again the same concerns if there's
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
highly confidential medical information
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
that must be discussed as part of the
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearing um
 
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.510 align:start position:0%
hearing um
it

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
i i think it really should be non-public
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
so which
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
so which section are you
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
would you be deleting the part
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
that talks about the
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
final actions and so forth
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
i i would recommend deleting the first
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
sentence of that section so the first
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
sentence of three ton a1i subsection 4
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
which is on page 2.
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you the sentence disciplinary
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
proceedings shall be open to the public
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
and representative goal you notice that
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
it said by order of the board council or
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next uh change please
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure there was only one more and this
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
was actually one i caught
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
oh um
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
so when we went through this before i
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that i added in the
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
provision to make non-disciplinary
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
remedial actions exempt from disclosure
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
under 91a
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i had said i had added it in because
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
i did not see it in the draft
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
i was wrong it it does occur in the
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
draft on page
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
what is it page 3 310 a1j
 
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.630 align:start position:0%
what is it page 3 310 a1j
um

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
subsection six had the same exact
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
language um
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
as what i had added in
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
however i i believe it makes more sense
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
up where i added it in um because it's
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
with the section on non-disciplinary
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
remedial action
 
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.190 align:start position:0%
remedial action
um

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion is to delete it from
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
310 a1j
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
and essentially move it up to the new
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
section i had created
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay this is is i guess more
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
organization of the statute than
 
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.310 align:start position:0%
organization of the statute than
anything

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
dr warner
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you i i had raised my hand
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
on the other item about
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh the conflict between those two things
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
about having the hearing made public
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to point out that
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
eliminating the general one and going to
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
the more specific one is very helpful
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
and allows the board to close a portion
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
of the meeting for good cause and that
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
will make it consistent with
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
for example the privacy
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
statute language change that was made
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.750 align:start position:0%
that if
uh

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
a patient is subpoenaed to testify at a
 
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.950 align:start position:0%
a patient is subpoenaed to testify at a
hearing

00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
would like that to be
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
shielded from the public that they can
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
and and so this helps
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
reflect that
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
great um
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
if i hear uh no
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh concerns or objections by the
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i'd like to speak with hope
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
do i see ahead
 
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.950 align:start position:0%
do i see ahead
uh

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
i will uh speak with oplc
 
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
i will uh speak with oplc
uh

00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
after this or just to be sure that we're
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
we have these changes so that the
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can vote
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment on section 7. but that
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
brings me to the last issue
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
which is substantive
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's come to my attention in the course
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
of this last few hours of the past 48
 
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.430 align:start position:0%
of this last few hours of the past 48
hours

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
that the disciplinary
 
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.950 align:start position:0%
that the disciplinary
procedure

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
for the board of psychology is different
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
than the disciplinary
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
procedure for say the other boards
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
in particular the board of medicine
 
00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.750 align:start position:0%
in particular the board of medicine
and

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
my instinct is the whole point of what
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
we've been doing lately is that unless
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
there is good reason shown
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary hearings should be the
 
00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.310 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary hearings should be the
same

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.349 align:start position:0%
same
and

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to either
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
make the disciplinary hearings for
 
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.150 align:start position:0%
make the disciplinary hearings for
procedure

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
for the board of psychology agree or be
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
the same as consistent with the board of
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
medicine or the other way i'm not sure
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
why we have two on the screen
 
00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:37.349 align:start position:0%
why we have two on the screen
and

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
that is represents a substantive change
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
which i can undertake on my own and have
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
a separate amendment
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
but i want to alert the subcommittee
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
that that is an issue
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
or could be an issue now the
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can choose to
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
i want to hear from dr warner because i
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
expect that she'll object to my concern
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm willing to listen to reason but
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
i do listen to reason
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
but i
um

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.589 align:start position:0%
 
like

00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
to have that
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
resolved now whether
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
it is worth the trouble at this point is
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
a question for the subcommittee or the
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
full committee to decide
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh we have right now if i don't say
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
another word a fine document on section
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
get into uh
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
good form for our vote
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
at our next subcommittee meeting got to
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
figure out when that will be by the way
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
so having said that
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear from
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
dr warner i guess why the
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
why the
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
board of psychology cannot use the board
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
of medicine's disciplinary procedure
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
if she's not if
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
if she's ready if you're ready to
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
discuss that i realize i'm springing
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
this on you sure
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
so sure i i'm always ready to discuss
 
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.109 align:start position:0%
so sure i i'm always ready to discuss
that

00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead please that's just fine um
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking i appreciate it
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
very much i i think that the board of
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
psychology has done a lot of work
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
on their procedures probably more so
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
than many of the other boards
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're we've refined it greatly i think
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
that the board of medicine could could
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps adopt some of our
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
more advanced procedures but then again
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
they are a much larger profession and
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
some of those things might not be
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
might be workable or feasible for them
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
certainly for the sanity of the oplc
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the process
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
a consistency is highly desirable
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be a nice goal
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps one might put together like a
 
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.309 align:start position:0%
perhaps one might put together like a
two-year

00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh study in addition outside of this
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
whole omnibus bill but a study to look
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
at what are the the better parts of all
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
the various boards and see if they could
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
brought together into some sort of
 
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.190 align:start position:0%
brought together into some sort of
amalgamation

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
amalgamation
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
that would be fruitful for the sanity of
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
oplc as well as the good jurisdiction of
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
these boards but there are things like
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
the privacy statute that um several of
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
you are very very familiar with you said
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec representative
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
mcguire representative schmidt and
 
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.829 align:start position:0%
mcguire representative schmidt and
others

00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
were very involved in
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
that privacy matter and and we were
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
helping representative neil kirk and i
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
had certainly hoped that after practice
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
and in the
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
boards of mental health practice and
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
board of psychologists that those
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
procedures could be refined a little bit
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
and perhaps promulgated to the other
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
boards there are things like that as
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
well as our uh our own and the board of
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
mental health two-step process in terms
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
of allegation and then complaint that is
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
very very good for
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
both protecting the public as well as
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
being fair to the professions
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine has something
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
slightly similar i believe where they do
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
some mediation before it goes before
 
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
some mediation before it goes before
review

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
but these things
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
there's many many fine points to this
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
that i think should be
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
very much closely examined and
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
especially with the commission perhaps
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
with representatives from these
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
different boards or people who are no um
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
that are familiar with these processes
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
that could examine this
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
in detail
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
and also obviously lplc involved so that
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
they can say what they think will be
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable for them to do
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
so that's what i would suggest for your
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
desire to bring consistency i'm not
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
against consistency
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
cumbersome things to deal with in that
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
for oplc's comments but let's recognize
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative schuett first
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
i do have an appreciation for the need
 
00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:32.870 align:start position:0%
i do have an appreciation for the need
for

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
privacy for particularly as dr warner
 
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.309 align:start position:0%
privacy for particularly as dr warner
suggested

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
patients who are testifying in any of
 
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.950 align:start position:0%
patients who are testifying in any of
these

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
fields there's always
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the concern with
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
hypoplations etc for what's divulged
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh i'm a little saddened to not see
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
representatives of the other board that
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
are being mentioned
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh prepped for input this morning i
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
might be helpful
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
i would add also i i believe that
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
as large as this overhaul
 
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.790 align:start position:0%
as large as this overhaul
of

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
oplc is
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
i think we can probably all agree that
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
there will probably need to be
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
some tweaks going forward after this is
 
00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.309 align:start position:0%
some tweaks going forward after this is
enacted

00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if it would be useful
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
if it's necessary for us to give
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
permission or if it's just something
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
that oplc could foster
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
instead of a commission just perhaps
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
casual meetings of
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
representatives of each of the
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
medical field boards particularly get
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
together and
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
talk about where they could come to
 
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.710 align:start position:0%
talk about where they could come to
agreement

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
on these kinds of subjects
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schuett i would
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think you're absolutely right but the
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
the section that we left in saying
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings shall be open
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
except upon order of the board etc upon
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
good cause shown
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
i think protecting the privacy of a
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:35.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
okay but the general question about
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
which representative should brought up
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
brings up
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
is whether
 
00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.069 align:start position:0%
is whether
we

00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
in by implication whether we need to
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
address that today or whether
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
consistent with what dr warner has said
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is a larger picture and maybe we
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
want to look at various medical boards
 
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
want to look at various medical boards
and

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
dental nurse uh
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
the met board of medicine itself and try
 
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.670 align:start position:0%
the met board of medicine itself and try
to

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
re-examine either on local i guess
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
oplc's own to suggest possible tweaks as
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
representative schuett described them
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i think we're probably going to leave
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
this battle for another day
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
although it's i think it's worth
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
spending the time one time to try to get
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
them get the procedures a uniform
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
procedure because i still i don't see
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
much difference any difference between
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
how the board of medicine may approach a
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
complaint as opposed to the board of
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
psychology let's get the best of each
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
both worlds
 
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.750 align:start position:0%
both worlds
okay

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so i think this
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
issue of privacy is uh really central to
 
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.470 align:start position:0%
issue of privacy is uh really central to
uh

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
our deliberations and i was troubled at
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
first when i said that when i heard that
 
00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
first when i said that when i heard that
um

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know that proceedings are going to
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
be open to the public
 
00:48:07.359 --> 00:48:08.710 align:start position:0%
be open to the public
because

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
the one thing that
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
differentiates us most from other
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
creatures on the planet is
 
00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:16.790 align:start position:0%
creatures on the planet is
what

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes is called spirit or mind uh
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
but is
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely central and to the degree
 
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.510 align:start position:0%
absolutely central and to the degree
that

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh you've got a bad knee or a shoulder
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh if you're
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
an athlete and and bad shoulder puts you
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
out of action
 
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.430 align:start position:0%
out of action
that's

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate but that's not the kind
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is so important but to the degree
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
that somebody and that's why the board
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
of psychiatry is special uh and so i
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
think that the privacy of people uh and
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
not only if they're testifying but
 
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.510 align:start position:0%
not only if they're testifying but
perhaps

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
the complaint would involve something
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't involve testimony of the of
 
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
that doesn't involve testimony of the of
the

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
the patient of the individual the client
 
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.790 align:start position:0%
the patient of the individual the client
but

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
but involves a discussion of how the
 
00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
but involves a discussion of how the
practitioner

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
may have
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
sinned if you will against that person
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
and where their private
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
matters would come under discussion that
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely cannot be
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh open to the public so uh i think we
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
have to have language it makes it clear
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm okay with the psychiatrist and
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
the psycho psychiatry being a special
 
00:49:29.359 --> 00:49:31.349 align:start position:0%
the psycho psychiatry being a special
case

00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
it is the board of psychology
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
oh sorry so i i'm so
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
psychology thank you for correcting that
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair you and i can talk about that
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
if this when that day ever dawns but i
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
think medical issues such as getting uh
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
whether you have an std is something
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
that is a little different than a sore
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
shoulder so i think
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
there are issues out there but the
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
privacy aspect is is especially crucial
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
um i think the board of psychology and
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
if there were a box up there that had
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
somebody from the medical profession
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
they might say the same thing but let's
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
leave that battle for another day i
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
agreed to that too mr chairman
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
i have a suggestion
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could extend
 
00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:21.030 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could extend
would

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
something like good cause shall include
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
the private information of individuals
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
other than the licensing
 
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
other than the licensing
because

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
the licensee's private information is
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
something that's a matter of discipline
 
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.430 align:start position:0%
something that's a matter of discipline
but

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
individuals other than the licensees
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think that i think the chair's
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
observation that we're going to save it
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
for another day gives us the opportunity
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
to ruminate about this whole complex and
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
come up with alternatives for for that
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
other day
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
it isn't that i disagree with
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire it's just i
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to think about it
 
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.349 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to think about it
and

00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's a part of the bigger
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
picture i realize that sounds like
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
kicking the cam can down the road and it
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
is but it's being done in good faith
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to try to get the best of
 
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.630 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to try to get the best of
uh

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
such as it may be uh things may well
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
let's that's that's for another day uh
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
mr porter mike europe
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
i uh thank you very much so um i wanted
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
to go back to something representative
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
schuett mentioned which is um
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
rather than a study and and i couldn't
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
agree more and so something i want to
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
let the subcommittee
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
know is part of my job as the
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement administrator is kind of
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
like being an ambassador to all the
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
boards where we are meeting with each
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
board individually and there's 55 total
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
so it's going to take a while but
 
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.150 align:start position:0%
so it's going to take a while but
um

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
we are flushing out processes that work
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
versus processes that don't work and i
 
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.030 align:start position:0%
versus processes that don't work and i
think

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
one of the central issues that i think i
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
know i mentioned in the very very
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
beginning uh a couple weeks ago was
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the balance of the public health safety
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
and welfare with the due process rights
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
of the licensee and when we talk about
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
public health safety and welfare
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
we also
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
really need to include
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the disciplinary portion the privacy
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
of third parties and i know i've had
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
these conversations with dr warner
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
about you know when to subpoena records
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
who's authorized um but more importantly
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
trends unfortunately that we've been
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
seeing here in enforcement involve um
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
sexual assault allegations
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
and those can be um career enders for
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
the licensee but it can also be
 
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.750 align:start position:0%
the licensee but it can also be
um

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
very difficult for the alleged victim
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we do have victims who are victims
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault and i think having
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
these privacy issues uh having having
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
those closed off during a hearing this
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
isn't criminal court um this is
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
administrative and i think that it is
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
something we are having conversations
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
with each board about so
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
um i really want to thank representative
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
schuett for for address talking about
 
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.069 align:start position:0%
schuett for for address talking about
that

00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
we are engaged in that and we can we
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
will continue to engage
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
next week i think i have three board
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
meetings where we'll be discussing these
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
so mr porter do i take from this that as
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
time goes by
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
you will be examining
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary proceedings for the
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
various boards and doing some of this on
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
your or making suggestions
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh on your own
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
i came at it just from the consistency
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the two boards psychology and medical
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
it may be a bigger picture than that
 
00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.950 align:start position:0%
it may be a bigger picture than that
and

00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.870 align:start position:0%
and
i

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
i would look forward to seeing
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
a uniform procedure among the
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
medical professions uh
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
with exceptions as as appropriate
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
so is that fair to expect this for the
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
next few years
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
very fair and and i definitely want to
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
say that um
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
you know like the medical board i'm
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
working closely with the mrsc as well as
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
our ultimate goal with this bill is
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what you just mentioned
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
consistency and efficiency across all
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
boards because that actually helps the
 
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
general public as well
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
mike thank you and if schmidt and i get
 
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
reelected when this gets done let us
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
i was i was going to ask the same thing
 
00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:55.670 align:start position:0%
i was i was going to ask the same thing
but

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
at this point i think we're going to
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
leave that big picture as part of the
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
big picture i'm going to ask
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
for oplc to continue its fine
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
really great work you did in um
 
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.309 align:start position:0%
really great work you did in um
buffing

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
buffing
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
not buffing it up uh
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
changing this
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
on section seven in accordance with what
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the subcommittee i
 
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.390 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the subcommittee i
will

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
ask that
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
when requested by the board the office
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
shall inside an investigator full stop
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
be changed to something like when
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
requested by the board and to the extent
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh requested by the board the office
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
shall sign an investigator who may
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
assist in the investigation
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think i think that just smoother
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
and keeps
 
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
and keeps
clear

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
board is
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
right mike right tom
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about that yes i i
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
i like to listen to reason even if i
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't agree with it
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i i agree that that's it doesn't um
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think it
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think it changes it in a way
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
would be unhappy with i think it just

be going over each of the sections to
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
say do we pass it do we kill it or do we
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%

pam put together a final amendment

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.510 align:start position:0%
vote on that at a subsequent executive
session

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%

thank you next tuesday the
 
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
fourth i think it is
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
we will have to have an exact session
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
after that because there is
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
also a work session on
 
00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:17.829 align:start position:0%
also a work session on
uh

00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
155 is on the sixth i believe as a
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
couple right there so we'll have to have
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
something the following week
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
right thank you and actually um
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
tom and lindsay b
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
i just saw lindsay's suggestion about
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
some changes for uh that she wants
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
included in here
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
i think they might be better in senate
 
00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
i think they might be better in senate
bill

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.789 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:44.799 --> 00:58:48.069 align:start position:0%
uh
52.

00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if lindsay's on but not a
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
panelist i'm
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that's fine
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
to get in wherever it needs to get in
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
this is about the requirement that the
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
board signed the licenses
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
correct yep so if
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
that amendment i'm assigning to the
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
it is equally applicable
 
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.589 align:start position:0%
it is equally applicable
to

00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
52 and i think it's actually more
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it's a technical
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
change rather than a substantive change
 
00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
change rather than a substantive change
okay

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
to skip an actual sub-committee meeting
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
or just the formality of what at our
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
next meeting can present this uh
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment with these basically
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
technical changes so it does i hope it
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
at this point i'm going to say uh
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and to you
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%

medical services personnel licensure
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
interstate compact
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you

we have this discussion on it you're the
 
01:14:06.159 --> 01:14:07.510 align:start position:0%
we have this discussion on it you're the
introduction

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
would anybody
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
i would mr chair
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
just please representative roy
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
i i think that this uh bill if it ever
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
becomes necessary is premature
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
this compact was joined several years
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
ago however it just came into effect
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
last year in the middle of the pandemic
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
all i've read carefully all the
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
arguments against it and they're all
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
hypothetical every single one of them
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
this might happen that's bad this could
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
maybe potentially happen that's bad
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
the arguments for it are real the
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
department of defense told us that this
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
would negatively affect
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
military families stationed at our air
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
base and actually put
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
in peril
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
the air base itself being located in new
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire which brings over a billion
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
dollars of money to the local economy
 
01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
dollars of money to the local economy
so

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
weighing those two things i just cannot
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
see why we would want to repeal this
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
after it just came into effect and we
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
really don't know the results of it if
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
in the future at some point
 
01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:22.310 align:start position:0%
in the future at some point
the

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
hypothetical fears of the people against
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
it come to pass we can always revisit
 
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.149 align:start position:0%
it come to pass we can always revisit
this

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
and fine tune it but right now uh i just
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary to appeal
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
this your statute thank you
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
i do support this section um
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
i was on edna when this was uh
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
voted on and put into place and i was
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
against it then and i'm still against it
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
now um
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
i believe we are
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
jumping into something that we truly
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
what the effects are or what is going to
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
happen going on down the road um
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
using the excuse that we want to be on
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
board so we can have a seat at the table
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
i think is a poor excuse
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
um let this thing form uh we ought to
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
sit back see how it works see what
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
and this is with not just this compact
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
but the number of compacts we've gone
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
into um
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
i looked at and i pulled up the language
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
in the rsa
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
regarding this compact
 
01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:36.229 align:start position:0%
regarding this compact
and

01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's the same boilerplate as all the
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
other compacts and to borrow accept a
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
contract for services of personnel
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to employees
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
of a member state to hire employees
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
elect or appoint officers fix
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
compensation define duties grant
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
individuals appropriate authority to
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
and it goes on and on
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know purchasing except appropriate
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
gifts donation otherwise
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
sell convey
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know how
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
big these compacts are planning to grow
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
and what the cost is going to be
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
we have the ability here
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we need
 
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.030 align:start position:0%
if we need
help

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
use our mutual aid agreements with
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
surrounding states
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we also have
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
the power of the governor
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
to have reciprocity with those who are
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
already licensed if we need them in the
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
time of emergency declaring a state of
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
emergency without having this compact in
 
01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.709 align:start position:0%
emergency without having this compact in
place

01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen that under coven 19 the
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
biggest pandemic
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
not needing this
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
people going up
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
to other states for wildland fires and
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
this is a good thing so that they could
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
treat their personnel if needed
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh i i feel that if we're going to other
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
states for wildland fires
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
those states are under a state of
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
emergency and their governors could do
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
the same thing that our governor did
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
under this pandemic and have reciprocity
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
for these folks without this need being
 
01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:22.950 align:start position:0%
for these folks without this need being
needed

01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
and for the fact that we talk about
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
um what ifs
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
i think the what if is also with the
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
closing of ps because we don't enact
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
this i think that's a hypothetical as
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
well i don't think it's justification i
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it would happen
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
um so i'm not sure why
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was brought up
 
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.350 align:start position:0%
that was brought up
um

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
with that being said uh the only other
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
issue i have is
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
01:18:48.719 --> 01:18:49.910 align:start position:0%
these individuals
uh

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
understanding the standing protocols
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
as an emt i had to
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
do here in new hampshire with mitch's
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
fire department
 
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.990 align:start position:0%
fire department
protocol

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
updates and exams
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
to stay up to date with the state
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
protocols as we bring people in and out
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
for a weekly tour or
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
two-week tour or three-week tour who are
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
the protocols and
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
who are they going to be using
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
to cover that and i have
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
concerns about that as well
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there are a couple of hands
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
up in the attendee list i don't know if
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
recognize one one is identified as ems
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
compact and the other is chief justin
 
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.310 align:start position:0%
compact and the other is chief justin
romanello

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
romanello
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like me to bring them over
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay i just have a question for
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative golly so you are
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify are you in favor of striking
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
this section or keeping in the bill
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
which will
 
01:19:59.679 --> 01:20:01.750 align:start position:0%
which will
effectively

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
could you repeat
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
that will effectively
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
nullify the compact agreement we have
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i think i
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
better turn on my light shoulder
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
people can see me but uh
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
i uh obviously appreciate representative
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
goldie's consistency i
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
position as in shade from when uh the
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee adopted this uh
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
compact a couple of years ago i served
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee as did former
 
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative mark prue i spoke with
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
him uh and uh he was surprised to hear
 
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
that there was going to be an effort to
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
repeal the bill
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh to repeal the the compact i believe
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
that the our state's experience with
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
compacts has been
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
a very strong uh as a matter of fact
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
there are additional entities looking to
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh to join compacts uh with other states
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh that are currently under
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
consideration in other bills that we're
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
hearing um and uh the
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
the examination that i've
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
undertaken with regard to how those
 
01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.870 align:start position:0%
undertaken with regard to how those
compact

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.950 align:start position:0%
compact
participants

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
participants
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
looked at their compacts is that they
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
feel strongly that the compacts are
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
advantageous for the state advantages
 
01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
for their profession and i agree with uh
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative roy's remark that the
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
compact on the replica has just gone
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
into effect we hardly have any
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
experience with it at all so to prejudge
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
it at this point i think is premature
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact that compacts
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
as a general rule in the state are very
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
favorably viewed
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
and and that they are desirable
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
so uh i hope that we'll hear from
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh people who are stakeholders uh as
 
01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.149 align:start position:0%

committee i will speak the very same
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
sentiments to uh expedite things along i
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
agree with the position of
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative goalie 100
 
01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.189 align:start position:0%
representative goalie 100
and

01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't i think repealing this at this
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
time is not the way to go thank you
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
attendees

01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
um i i don't feel that i
 
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.189 align:start position:0%
um i i don't feel that i
have

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know very much about this
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
particular area of the compacts
 
01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:23.270 align:start position:0%
particular area of the compacts
but

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
my focus the thing that i that i did
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
care about
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
because i could understand it to some
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
extent is the
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
ability of
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
people from new hampshire to support
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
other states when they're dealing with
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
wildfires that sort of thing and that we
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
could get the same help
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
but as representative goalie said
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know we can we can do that through
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
other channels and i know we've been
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
doing for decades we've been providing
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
support for other states when they have
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
wildfires so if we could do it before
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
and seems like we can still do it that
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
we have somebody from the attendees you
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes um i don't know his name um he's
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
just identified as ems compact and then
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
chief justin romanello are both
 
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.550 align:start position:0%
chief justin romanello are both
with

01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
the panel now
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
and so they both can unmute themselves
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
and speak and maybe give us a name
 
01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.110 align:start position:0%
and speak and maybe give us a name
thanks

01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.310 align:start position:0%
thanks
thanks

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
good good morning i i appreciate you uh
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
let me join you here for a moment my
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
name is dan manz i'm the educator for
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
the emergency medical services compact i
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
um i work for the interstate commission
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
for ems personnel practice we in ems
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
like to confuse everybody with acronyms
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
i work for the commission um replica
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
is the acronym we use for the
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislation so uh uh the terminology
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
kind of gets used interchangeably
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
my purpose in joining you today i just
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
try and clarify some things that i think
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
may have come up in prior testimony that
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
um that that may be useful for you as
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
you go forward in thinking about a
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
decision on this particular bill
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
one of the questions was does the ems
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
compact allow out-of-state ambulance
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
services to operate in new hampshire
 
01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
services to operate in new hampshire
without

01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
obtaining a new hampshire state
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
ambulance service license the quick
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
answer that is no
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
the compact legislation only applies to
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
qualified ems personnel the compact has
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
no authority there's no mention in the
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
compact law that relates to agencies or
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles and so the legislation you
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
currently have in place
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything about new
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's regulatory authority over
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
agencies ambulances
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
in any way it only extends the privilege
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
to practice to individually license ems
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
personnel from other compact member
 
01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:23.990 align:start position:0%
personnel from other compact member
states

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
it was referenced i heard earlier
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
compact did become operational this past
 
01:26:28.719 --> 01:26:29.669 align:start position:0%
compact did become operational this past
year

01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
we've had hundreds of interstate
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
crossings related to covid's support as
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
the historic 2020 wildland fires
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
out west i heard that also
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned i think it's important to note
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
that while
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
individual providers are authorized with
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
this privilege to practice the compact
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
also provides the receiving state with
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
legal authority over
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
the work of any out-of-state ems
 
01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.270 align:start position:0%
the work of any out-of-state ems
personnel

01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
another question i understood did come
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
up earlier was does the compact have any
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
effect on a community's mutual aid
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
arrangements again the quick answer to
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
that is no
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
because the compact legislation only
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
applies to personnel the compact really
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
has no authority or
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
involvement in how a community
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
chooses to arrange its
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
mutual aid
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
i think uh you may also have heard
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
testimony this um
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
compact does not change or interfere in
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
any way with emac the emergency
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
management assistance compact um if
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's a declared state of emergency in
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or any other compact
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
member state the provisions of emac
 
01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
member state the provisions of emac
supersede

01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
supersede
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
replica in that case
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
another item i heard i've heard
 
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning was about the
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-state ems person's scope of
 
01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.030 align:start position:0%
out-of-state ems person's scope of
practice

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
section 4c of the legislation the model
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that new hampshire
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
previously adopted
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
addresses that question and it reads an
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
individual providing patient care in a
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
remote state under the privilege to
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
practice shall function within the scope
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
of practice authorized by the home state
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
where they came from
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
unless and until
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
modified by an appropriate authority in
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
the remote state
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
the the effect of that is that while the
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
default of the compact is the person
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
uses their home state scope of practice
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire felt that it needed to
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
modify that or control that in any way
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
the compact gives new hampshire full
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
to do that so you you don't give up in
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
any way um that that authority over
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
personnel entering new hampshire
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's also important to sort
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
of understand because again it was
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is a fairly new
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
activation of this compact
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
what it is new hampshire would give up
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
by leaving the compact and i think one
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that sort of baked
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
into the loaf here with this is a level
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
quality platform for persons entering
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire under the privilege to
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
practice provisions so the current
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
legislation as you have it
 
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.590 align:start position:0%
legislation as you have it
requires

01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
requires
 
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.390 align:start position:0%
requires
uh

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
all of the member states in the compact
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
to use a common set of standards for
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
their personnel they all have to be
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
educated to national standards they have
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
to obtain certification from the
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
national registry of emts and they must
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
have passed an fbi fingerprint
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
background check and while most of the
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
compact states require that today the
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
fingerprint background check
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
specifically becomes effective on
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
october of uh 2022.
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
i can affirmatively state to you because
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm coming to you this morning from the
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
great state of vermont right next door
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
where i used to be the state ems
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
director here that not all of the states
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
bordering new hampshire currently meet
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
all of those quality requirements
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
another thing new hampshire would give
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
up is access to
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
the national ems coordinated database
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and i'll just give you one
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
sort of example from my experience here
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
as the ems director in vermont we had an
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
applicant from out of state
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
come in apply for an emt license in
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
vermont check the box on the application
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
indicating you had no prior disciplinary
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
history or
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
license action in any other
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
state later as we were processing this
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
guy's application we got a call heard
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
through the grapevine that this person
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
had been diverting drugs in the state
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
that um he was moving from
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
it turned out he was a physician
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
assistant and an emt in another state um
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
i ended up calling the state and they
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
were able to share the information that
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
this guy had been under investigation
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
for diverting drugs in his work as a pa
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
the the practice board in the other
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
state was in the process of its final
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
hearing to revoke this guy's license
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
when he walked in and voluntarily
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
surrendered his pa license and and his
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
emt license he then moved to vermont
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
retook an emt class sought licensure in
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
this state never disclosed the the
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
background he was being investigated for
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
in another state
 
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.669 align:start position:0%
in another state
the

01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:58.950 align:start position:0%
the
database

01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
that the compact states share would
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
enable new hampshire to see that kind of
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
information that investigatory
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
information and license action
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
license action information for
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
over 300 000 ems personnel that are in
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
the compact today
 
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
the compact today
who

01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
could move to new hampshire and seek
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
license in new hampshire at some point
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it would also you lose the ability to
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
revoke an out-of-state person's
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice if someone came in
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
from out of state um today
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you have the ability if they come
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
from a compact state to curtail remove
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
their scope of practice
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
just as you could remove the license
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
from any person you issued a license to
 
01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.550 align:start position:0%
from any person you issued a license to
um

01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.070 align:start position:0%
um
currently

01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire if you remove a
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
person's privilege to practice they lose
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
it in every other compact state and
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
their home state agrees to investigate
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
whatever happened in new hampshire just
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
as if it had happened in the uh in the
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
home state incredibly powerful tool that
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
you end up with in new hampshire to
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
control bad practice from other people
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
final point
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think has been alluded to that new
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire would become
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
less military friendly by exiting this
 
01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
less military friendly by exiting this
compact

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
the compact provides military personnel
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
and their families expedited processing
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
of license applications as well as the
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice when they move
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
around around between compact member
 
01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.550 align:start position:0%
around around between compact member
state

01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
sorting out all of the license
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
requirements paying the fees and waiting
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
to find work in the civilian sector are
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
all complexities of military life and
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's really the reason that the
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
military so strongly supports
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
these health occupational licensing
 
01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.950 align:start position:0%
these health occupational licensing
compacts

01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
compacts
 
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:05.830 align:start position:0%
compacts
so

01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
in summary
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
compact does not allow agencies from
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
member states to cross borders and
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
perform ems duties doesn't affect the
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
community's mutual aid agreements
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retains full control over
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice of ems personnel
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
entering the state
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
having new hampshire
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
withdraw from the compact erodes some
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
important public protection elements and
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
it could create a situation where new
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire is viewed as less military
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
friendly so i thank you i just wanted to
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
clarify those points and i'll i'll stay
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
on if there's any questions i could help
 
01:34:44.719 --> 01:34:45.430 align:start position:0%
on if there's any questions i could help
with

01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
would just like to respond to some of
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
that because i i think it's
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
a shame at this time and uh in this
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
place if we can't have a national we
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
have to be part of a compact to find out
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
someone inside a licensed revoked um i i
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
think it's wrong
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a problem with the system if
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
second i'd like to uh follow up on uh we
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
hear that well they can continue with
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
state protocols but yet we heard they
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
come here under their home state
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
protocols until we determine whether
 
01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
they abide by new hampshire protocols
 
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.229 align:start position:0%
they abide by new hampshire protocols
um

01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a registry or a
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
database when someone crosses compact to
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
compact state lines that they must
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
immediately notify
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the bureau of ems here in new hampshire
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they've come from another compact
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
state and are practicing here for that
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
for a point of time
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
how do we address the issues of
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
protocols and determine when the
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
home state license protocol is
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
transferred over to new hampshire
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
protocol because i heard conflicting um
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
information there as to they go along
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
with home state until it's determined by
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that they use our
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
protocols and which protocols i mean
 
01:36:06.239 --> 01:36:08.229 align:start position:0%
protocols and which protocols i mean
um

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
they have to be practicing uh i know in
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
manchester we had to have a medical
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
director um our hospital is the elliott
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
hospital uh with manchester fire um so
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's gonna
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
be different from uh
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
different communities across the state
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire as to who the medical
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
director is that they're practicing on
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
there as well as the protocols that they
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
will um
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
so with that um and i also think that
 
01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
in treating the military individuals
 
01:36:37.110 --> 01:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to right here in new
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire law we can change that and
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
address the issues to expedite military
 
01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.390 align:start position:0%
address the issues to expedite military
families

01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
with licensing
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
oh thank you i i was first of all i was
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that the witness could respond to
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
a representative goalie's concerns and
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
then i had a question myself
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay could we do that
 
01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
okay could we do that
please

01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
sure what what specifically would you
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
well he he just said some concerns about
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh scope of practice and uh when they
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
would fall into new hampshire protocols
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
versus their home state protocols um if
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
you could respond to that also
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
also it just it seems like um it seems
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
like we're talking about um this worry
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
about people coming into the state and
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
just setting up shop and not reporting
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
and starting to practice isn't it true
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
that they can't until they get a license
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
in the state either via the compact or
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
actual new hampshire license i mean no
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
one's going to come in and set up their
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
own ems shop are they
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
and this is chief romano can i can i
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
answer that just from our perspective
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
from the bureau of ems it it might help
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
if the representative roy is okay with
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
that i believe he will
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear actually from both i'd
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
like to hear from the compact itself and
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
the chief would be great too all right
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
chief please
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
sorry about the interruption
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
um i i do want to explain uh just one
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
piece with with new hampshire so um
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it ties into the the comments that
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
that uh the compact had made so so in
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire 153 a is our governor
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
governor rsa and so with ems the only
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
entities in the state that have the
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
legal ability to provide ems services
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
are licensed ems units as an individual
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
provider i'm a paramedic i cannot
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
provide ems care unless i have an
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
affiliation with a licensed ems unit why
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's important here is
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
in as the combat stated with section
 
01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.709 align:start position:0%
in as the combat stated with section
four

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
is that automatically based on our rules
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state provider coming in from
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh from their home state into us being a
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
remote state would have to automatically
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
follow new hampshire rules and so with
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
that as a provider they would have to
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
follow what's required by the licensed
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
unit to perform care so medical
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
direction medical resource hospital
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism in which the unit gets their
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
medical direction and their ability to
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
practice all is based on the unit so
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
those providers automatically would have
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
to fall in line with new hampshire ems
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
protocols at the time they begin uh
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
practicing under that licensed ems unit
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so um i think that would uh
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
addresses that concern right off the bat
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
so as an example i i won't pick on
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
anybody in particular but i'll use
 
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative goalie's example with
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
manchester fire if they needed personnel
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
and they called from personnel out of a
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
remote state and they came to manchester
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
fire manchester fire would have to put
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
them on the their roster
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
allow them access to the the ability to
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
to write ems run reports as a member of
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
the ems agency
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
and and then also they would be
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
responsible providing care based on new
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire protocols because that unit
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
has fallen under elliot hospital's
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
medical direction
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
and as their medical resource hospital
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
so that would that would take care of
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
that that issue right off the bat as
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
soon as the unit requested the
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
assistance from an out-of-state uh ems
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
agency for that matter
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
also it was mentioned about
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to practice and so in in 153
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
820 which is the commissioner of the
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety's ability to to
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
make rules there's a separate section
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
there that further provides protection
 
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire from
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
individuals coming into our state under
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
under the compact and that that rule at
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
the paraphrase essentially says
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
emergency medical service units licensed
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
under rsa 153 a10 shall not use
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
emergency medical service providers who
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
are privileged to practice from a remote
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
state under the compact in regular and
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
usual staff and patterns
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
or personnel so this is just a further
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
protection so
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
why do we even need the compact at this
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
point right we can't use it for
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations well i think covet
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a is a great example
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh as of when we we could use could have
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
used a compact and the reason why we
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
didn't is is i'm biased because i'm from
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but we did a phenomenal
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
job of protecting our providers we had
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
minimum ppe requirements that enabled
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
them to not be infected they were super
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
vigilant when they were providing
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
patient care in in limiting their
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
ability to do certain interventions
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
that were that were uh would have put
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
them in a higher danger of infecting the
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
disease so we did a great job with not
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
having any outbreaks at
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
an agency now if we did
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
mutual aid would certainly be uh be
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
utilized but if we found that there was
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
multiple outbreaks and that caused
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
system system issues
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
we certainly may have required the use
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the compact and maybe it would have
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
been more with the private entities
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
providing 911 services because they had
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
ability to pull from out of state
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
but either way i think that our
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
response to kovid prevented the
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
necessary the necessity of using the
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
compact but it certainly could have been
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
an example to it um and certainly here
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions or or follow up
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
with any comments thank you for your
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative roy do you have further
 
01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.470 align:start position:0%
representative roy do you have further
questions

01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh only uh well i do but i wanted to see
 
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
if the compact wanted to respond as well
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks i you know i agree with the
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
everything chief uh romanello shared
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
there um i think as a as a practical
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
matter um you know an emt entering or
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
paramedic entering new hampshire under
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
the compact privilege to practice um
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
as he explained your state laws already
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
require affiliation with an ems agency
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that agency is going to be allowing
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
that person use of the equipment
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
use of the communications use of the
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
necessary elements for that person to
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
practice and it makes logical sense in
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that the person will
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
follow new hampshire's scope of practice
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
um i think as a practical matter
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
thinking that
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately other new england states will
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
enter the compact which i believe is
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
true and ultimately some of the cross
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
border activity may occur with
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
personnel from surrounding new england
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
state the new england states have been
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
working for a number of years on moving
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
very closely together in their clinical
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
protocols and scopes of practice so as a
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
practical matter the differences are
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
pretty subtle today i think between what
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
happens in new hampshire and what
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
happens in the other new england state
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
but um to the extent that's a critical
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
point for new hampshire
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
you you've got the control and the way
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
people practice as an affiliate of an
 
01:44:24.159 --> 01:44:25.669 align:start position:0%
people practice as an affiliate of an
agency

01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
logically leads to them following the
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire protocols and scope of
 
01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire protocols and scope of
practice

01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative golly could i
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
ask a question now oh oh sorry i'm sure
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
this question can go to either the chief
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
or the contact um
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of discussion about
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know fire fighting fires out west if
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
when we're not talking about
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
firefighters are we i mean we're talking
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
about ems and i was wondering
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
if we could get a real world example and
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
not use covet because this was fast
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
before covert so there must have been a
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
need seen for this before coviz can can
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
we get a real world example of like
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
who would use this how and why
 
01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:13.030 align:start position:0%
who would use this how and why
um

01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
just something so we can you know sink
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
our teeth and understand what this
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
really is and who would really be using
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
this sure i i mean i can probably
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
provide you with that um
 
01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.590 align:start position:0%
provide you with that um
the

01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
state of colorado was a big user of the
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
compact they're a member of the compact
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
they had significant wildfire activity
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the past year and um had a number of
 
01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.629 align:start position:0%
in the past year and um had a number of
personnel

01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
come in as part of their wildland
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
firefighting crews who were in fact
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
providing ems support to those personnel
 
01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:50.390 align:start position:0%
providing ems support to those personnel
deployed

01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
deployed
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
on the on the fire lines in the past
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
this created complexity for colorado
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
colorado had to receive applications
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
from these people had to issue temporary
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
licenses or create some other process
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
to enable these people to practice
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
within colorado legally
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
the colorado ems director and i've
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
spoken about this a number of times he
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
said man life just got easy you see with
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
the compact because people would come in
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
from um out of state we knew uh you know
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
we knew what their training was
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
we knew what they were able to do
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
um it would authorize we didn't have to
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
take any action on them um at all to
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
enable and authorize their practice we
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
knew they were working under appropriate
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
medical direction and he said and it it
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
solved the problem for those people
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
because colorado was taking time to
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
process those applications during times
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
when things needed to move very very
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
quickly so they they viewed it as a huge
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
huge help and um that it worked out very
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
well in i i don't know how many cases
 
01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
well in i i don't know how many cases
but

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i think we're talking into the tens
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
or hundreds of cases that they used it
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
for wildland fire
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
support thank you
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just continue to
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
say that i think under a state of
 
01:47:32.639 --> 01:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
say that i think under a state of
emergency

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
governor done the same thing here and i
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
guess i would ask
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
the chief
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
isn't the uh
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
emergency orders or executive orders by
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
the governor to allow temporary
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
licensure another way to get around this
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
and if in the time of
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
needed care
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
it certainly certainly could be um we
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
didn't so it was something that we had
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
on our radar if it was necessary we saw
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts do some some pretty
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
drastic uh temporary waivers with their
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
license we didn't we didn't need to in
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
this response but it is a tool i think
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
in my experience with cobit there um
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
there were certainly some delays um and
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
i think that having the compact would
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
would alleviate those delays
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
in in a ideal world if we had people
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
around us that were able to use you know
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
that we could benefit from um you know
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
so i think it's it could be
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
if if we needed to make something happen
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
immediately i think the compact would
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial in that case but
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
certainly governor can can make those uh
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
emergency rules and orders and and we
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
can get the same effects uh if if we
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have the compact but the i think
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
the benefit is we do have the compact
 
01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.350 align:start position:0%
the benefit is we do have the compact
server

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
server
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
 
01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
hello

01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
i still need some clarification because
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
i've heard two different scenarios and
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure which is correct um
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with protocols
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
i heard was they would be dealing under
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
their home state protocol until
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
it is caught later on whether the state
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
wants them under their state protocol
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
then i heard as soon as they come here
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
they are under state protocol what's the
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
correct answer
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i i think it's
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
because the way the the
 
01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
replica and the compact is written to to
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
accommodate the 22 21 states that are in
 
01:49:20.239 --> 01:49:20.950 align:start position:0%
accommodate the 22 21 states that are in
it

01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
so there has to be some flexibility in
 
01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.149 align:start position:0%
so there has to be some flexibility in
in

01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
with with the interpretation of that as
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
as the state uh ems official my
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that is based on how
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
we license units and providers in the
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
state and that it's it's spelled out in
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
153 that the only entities in our state
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
that can provide care are licensed ems
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
units i think as soon as somebody comes
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
in from from their home state into us as
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
a remote state that my interpretation
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
and how that rule would be applied is
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
that they now fall under new hampshire
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
protocols based on the fact that the
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
unit is is what is delivering the care
 
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
and how our licensed units deliver care
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
is through the use of licensed ems
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
providers or in this case providers that
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
are given that privilege of practice
 
01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up follow up
 
01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.030 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up follow up
and

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
prior to patient care and working under
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire protocols is there any
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
exam they're required to take to show
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh competency and protocols
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
so they would
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
again my interpretation is that as soon
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
as somebody came in they would
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
and they have to operate under our
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
protocols then they would have to
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
satisfy the the scope of practice
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have in the
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
protocol exam real well i mean again
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be our
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
requirements once they enter is that if
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
they're working on our protocols they
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
they would have to follow that the the
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
um the paramedic scope practice or emt
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
scope of practice and protocol rollout
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
so um and that would be
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
essentially uh completed or required and
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
completed through the agency in the
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
medical resource hospital
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:08.790 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
in what time frame follow up
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
um so i'll be honest with you sir we
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't have a time frame i would it would
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
have to happen before
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
they assume
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
the ability to practice uh to start
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
practicing patient care so um i mean
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know this protocol rollout
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
it would it took me two hours to
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
complete it at the paramedic level um so
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge time requirement so you
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
know to me if if there was
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know i see a christie christie
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
was on here so if amr needed personnel
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
and and he called for assistance from
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
other amr units that are members of
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
combat states then my expectation would
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
be is as soon as they came in they would
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
need to practice under new hampshire
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
protocols and that part of the request
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
would be that they would have to meet
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
these requirements uh read the
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
requirements of the protocol rollout and
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
they can do that you know online for
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
that matter so i don't see
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
there being any interruption or any care
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
delivered not to the new hampshire
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
standard based on the fact that they
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
would be operating through that that
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
home new hampshire licensed agency and
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
before they can have access to the
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
abilities to provide care and the
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
resources they would need to meet that
 
01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.629 align:start position:0%
resources they would need to meet that
standard

01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be my expectation and if
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
they failed to do that then it would be
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know we would have the ability to to
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
investigate through compliance our
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
compliance department to ensure that
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
that is happening
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is not quite the public hearing we
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
already had that
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
um so can we please stay brief
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
if possible in the future
 
01:52:41.119 --> 01:52:42.830 align:start position:0%
if possible in the future
representative

01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
roy thank you mr chairman and uh in
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
keeping with that very briefly
 
01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.589 align:start position:0%
keeping with that very briefly
um

01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
this question goes to again either the
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
chief or the combat
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard that the
 
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.430 align:start position:0%
we've heard that the
same

01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
result can be obtained through a
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency order for expedited
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
licensure but with an emergency order
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
for expedited licensure give us access
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
to the interstate database
 
01:53:07.679 --> 01:53:08.629 align:start position:0%
to the interstate database
and

01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that we would not
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
be able to do just because we announced
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
this extra relationship to the
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order thank you
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
yeah let me tackle that one and you're
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
you're correct that um that's one of the
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
things you would give up you would not
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
have access to the
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
to the coordinated database and um and
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
accordingly your your governor could
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
under emergency circumstances say we'll
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we'll allow an emt from any
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
other state
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
to enter um new hampshire and work under
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
these exigent circumstances um you know
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
the downside of that is you you really
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
don't know affirmatively how was that
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
person educated you don't know how that
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
person was tested you don't have
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
assurance that they have medical
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
direction from their home state and you
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to see them in the
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
database you know it was it was
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier gosh we got to be able
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
to find out if these people are licensed
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know or have licenses revoked in
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
another state a
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
great idea that's really what this
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
compact provides and it's what does not
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
exist without this compact
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
um we have a few more witnesses
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
if we can go through them maybe also on
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
the brief side please
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
who's next stan
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
um uh chris stay was
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i'll be brief and
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
defer to everybody's time i just want to
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
reiterate that i believe um that the
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
benefits of this compact far outweigh
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
any potential risks that are out there
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire participates in upwards of
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
40 interstate licensure compacts i don't
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
know of any that we've exited i also
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
don't know of any that have been put
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
under the microscope as much as this one
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
has in in the recent past
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
i think that particularly in the middle
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
of a worldwide pandemic taking any tool
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
out of our toolbox as the people that
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the health and
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
safety of the citizens of this state is
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
irresponsible and we would support
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
examining this further looking at other
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
protections that we could add to it but
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
exiting is just not um it just doesn't
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
who's next
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
christopher arnold from the department
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
of defense is next and we do have two
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
more um attendees in the attendee list
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
that i'll promote
 
01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.510 align:start position:0%
that i'll promote
okay

01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and i'm so happy to be
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
good to see everyone again uh i'll
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know respond to the earlier question
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
um certainly the secretaries of the
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
military departments have made the
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
importance of military spouse licensure
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
explicitly clear as they consider the
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
availability of license reciprocity when
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
evaluating future basing or mission
 
01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:00.629 align:start position:0%
evaluating future basing or mission
alternatives

01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
and that consideration was codified by
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
congress as a requirement in the 2020
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
national defense authorization act
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
section 2883 which i encourage you all
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
to read and you can see copy of in my
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
testimony from the hearing the
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
secretaries must consider whether the
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
state in which an installation subject
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
to a basing decision is or will be
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
located has entered into reciprocity
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
agreements to recognize and accept
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
professional and occupational licensure
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
and certification credentials granted by
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
or in other states or allows for the
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
transfer of such licenses and
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
certifications granted by or in other
 
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:35.830 align:start position:0%
certifications granted by or in other
states

01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
so lessons that we've learned through
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
actions taken by states along with the
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
lessons from other initiatives such as
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
the national conference of state
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislatures the national governors
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
association the council of state
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
government's licensing consortium
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
provided dod an opportunity to consider
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
a working definition of reciprocity
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
our definition of reciprocity represents
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
less of an absolute interpretation of
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
the dictionary definition and more of a
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
description of a continuum of
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities for military spouses to
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
transfer an occupational license between
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
states which is why we advocate
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
for a variety of solutions
 
01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:15.189 align:start position:0%
for a variety of solutions
simultaneously

01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
in the immediate term
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh the short term and over the long term
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
compacts allow a practitioner to work in
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
multiple states without re-licensing
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
since these compacts are defined by
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
occupation and improved by the states
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
they take time to enact however
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
significant progress has been made on
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
obtaining the approval of existing
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
compacts for example in rhode island
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
governor mckee has put six of the seven
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
health occupation compacts in his 2021
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
budget proposal in connecticut governor
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
lamont's budget bills have a study of
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
five major health compacts including
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
replica to be completed by this fall and
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts governor baker's
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
executive order from january ordered a
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
similar study with reporting to the
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
governor uh due later or no later than
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
one july including the nine uh
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
occupations that are evaluated by the
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
department of the air force and their
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
basing criteria
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
which includes ems so i have a call with
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
a new england state later today and the
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
spouse of the army chief of staff the
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
spouse of the space force cso the spouse
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the chief of the air guard and
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
several others where we are discussing
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
the benefits of compacts with the senior
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
leadership in that state these states
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
have been listening closely to the
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
department of defense and our services
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
over the year that licensure compacts
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
are the preferred end state by dod and
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
the military services to obtain full
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
reciprocity the department has found
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
profession-specific interstate compacts
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
for licensing to be the most beneficial
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
and achievable alternative interstate
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
compact requires states to approve them
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
in law to join and as a result compacts
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
take time to become more effective
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
instead of counting compacts as relevant
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the currently
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
available licensing opportunities
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
we consider a state's commitment to or
 
01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
we consider them as provi
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
proving a state's commitment to
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
providing full reciprocity in the future
 
01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.350 align:start position:0%
providing full reciprocity in the future
uh

01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:04.310 align:start position:0%
uh
thereby

01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
thereby
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
repealing a compact would would be
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
moving in the opposite direction from
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
how uh we we evaluate that commitment
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
from the states so i'm happy to answer
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
any questions that the panel may have
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for your time
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
who's next pam
 
01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
i think it must be um eric shelberg
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
you can unmute yourself oh
 
01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:33.669 align:start position:0%
you can unmute yourself oh
okay

01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
morning thank you very much for
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to speak and
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
i will be very brief
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
i would just like to
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm representing the new hampshire
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
paramedic association
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
and we are very much in support of
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
keeping replica so we would like to see
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
part two stricken from this amended bill
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
and specifically we are looking at not
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
to rehash what has been said of what i
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
support i do support and we do support
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
for what has been mentioned today
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
but this also allows for new hampshire
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
with replica to this can be a force
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
multiplier for us in times of emergency
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
or in times when additional personnel
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
are needed
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
for specific activities
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
not for day-to-day operations
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
and so it's another tool in toolbox
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
and also if there is movement by the
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislative body to reduce or to
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
restrict the governor's emergency power
 
02:00:27.199 --> 02:00:28.149 align:start position:0%
restrict the governor's emergency power
orders

02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
this could be a tool that
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
stays in place that will not be affected
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
by that if something like that were to
 
02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:34.870 align:start position:0%
by that if something like that were to
pass

02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
i have a question mr chairman of this uh
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
this last testifier yes please
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
uh

02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:48.709 align:start position:0%
uh
so

02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
up to now we've mostly been speaking
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
about emergency situations but i was
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
thinking all along and you kind of
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
triggered it off again with your remarks
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
that in an emergency situation clearly
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
the governor can
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
declare that emergency or address that
 
02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:06.870 align:start position:0%
declare that emergency or address that
emergency

02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
but we i can imagine there might be
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
other circumstances and you kind of
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
alluded to that uh where it's not an
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
emergency situation where the governor
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
could not
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
act in that capacity
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh so the compact it
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me would uh give us additional
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
capabilities can you speak to that a
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:38.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
as i understand
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
from the compact that if there were a
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
large scale
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
activity that were to happen
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
this could allow for personnel to be
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
moved in
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
however i will defer that to mr manns
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
and or chief romanello
 
02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.270 align:start position:0%
and or chief romanello
okay

02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
i i'd be happy to try and tackle that
 
02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:00.870 align:start position:0%
i i'd be happy to try and tackle that
one

02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm sorry
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
can i go to representative schultz i'm
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
sorry end up oh thank you mr chair i
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
actually had a question
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
for mr arnold
 
02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:12.229 align:start position:0%
for mr arnold
um

02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
i admire the work you're doing to make
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure that military spouses are
 
02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
sure that military spouses are
accommodated

02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
accommodated
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly i think all of us
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the service of our military
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
very much so
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering though
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
have you worked with any states that
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
have looked at devising like you know
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
writing language at the state level
 
02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.669 align:start position:0%
writing language at the state level
to

02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:39.679 --> 02:02:40.950 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
assist military spouses
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
through our
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
licensing um
 
02:02:47.199 --> 02:02:48.470 align:start position:0%
licensing um
without

02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
going through a compact is that is that
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
something you're aware of or worked on
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
yourself or have any uh
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
language that you would recommend
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's a fantastic question and i
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
believe i did uh speak to that briefly
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
in my in my testimony uh at the hearing
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
last week but yes uh our office which is
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
in effect the state government arm of
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
the department of defense uh has been
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with military spouse licensure
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh since 2004
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
and we've passed about 700 pieces of
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh over the last 17 years so
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh we advocate for a variety of
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
approaches simultaneously
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
our goal is for a license to be issued
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
within 30 days that is the
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
the baseline outcome uh that we are
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:48.390 align:start position:0%
looking for
however

02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh like i said we're looking for a
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
variety of approaches simultaneously
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
because a state
 
02:03:58.070 --> 02:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
specific uh approach does not always
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
encompass the same definition of of
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocity from
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
one state to another so if you can
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee that someone's going to get
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
their license when they're coming to new
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire in 30 days that's wonderful
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
but what about the new hampshire
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
domiciled spouse who's serving at
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
vandenberg air force base uh in
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
california you cannot guarantee that
 
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
that person is going to get a license in
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
which is why the compacts present uh the
 
02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.790 align:start position:0%
which is why the compacts present uh the
optimal

02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
optimal
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
end state goal
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
for a 50 state license reciprocity does
 
02:04:36.070 --> 02:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
that answer your question representative
 
02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
that answer your question representative
schultz

02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
schultz
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
yes it does and i appreciate that
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
you probably did address it in your
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
initial testimony but i'm listening to
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
things differently now so
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
um i just want to plant that seed i get
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
why from your point of view
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
compacts certainly simplify the process
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
across state borders but if we go in the
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
direction of not going with a compact
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'd love to
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
circle back with you to see if we can
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
still accommodate spouses in some way
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.639 --> 02:05:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
compact approach uh is is not
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing in that there's not a
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
compact for every occupation nor is
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
every state a member of each compact in
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
the 2019 national defense authorization
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
act there was a requirement for the
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of defense to enter into a
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
cooperative agreement with what is known
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
as the center for interstate compacts
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
which is part of the council of state
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
governments to develop new
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
occupational interstate licensing
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
compacts and just last month we did the
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
press release announcing the first five
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
occupations that were selected
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
for funding which include
 
02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:49.750 align:start position:0%
for funding which include
teachers

02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
social workers dental and dental
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
hygienists massage therapists and
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists but as you know new
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire probably has over 50
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
occupational boards and even with five
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
more compacts coming online that would
 
02:06:06.070 --> 02:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
be a total of 12. so
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
for those other occupations uh we look
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
at what we call an expedited approach on
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
our continuum but again the word
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
expedited is something that varies from
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
state to state so
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
are you talking about uh expedited in
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll just move your occupation to
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
the front of the pile but then it sits
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
there for six months while we're
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
verifying that the algebra you took in
 
02:06:29.199 --> 02:06:30.470 align:start position:0%
verifying that the algebra you took in
1984

02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
1984
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
is the the same in new hampshire as it
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
is uh in maine uh or does it mean that
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know your your application is going
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
to be processed with a minimum of
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork and a minimum of fees so one
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
approach that we've seen states take
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
right across the border
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
working with their division of
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and regulation
 
02:06:49.199 --> 02:06:50.310 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and regulation
commissioner

02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
and head
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
we have a departmental bill
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
that was reported favorably from their
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
professional licensure committee and
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
will likely be enacted this year
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
that would allow a military spouse uh
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
upon submission of an affidavit to
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
receive a license within 30 days if that
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
affidavit indicates that they uh meet
 
02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:13.669 align:start position:0%
affidavit indicates that they uh meet
the

02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
standards to practice the occupation in
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
maine and essentially they'll issue them
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
a temporary license uh uh while they
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
pursue whatever state specific
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
requirements there are and that's a
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
great approach for getting
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
inside of our best practice
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
for that license within 30 days when
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're in the state of maine but the
 
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.750 align:start position:0%
you're in the state of maine but the
compacts

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
compacts
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
are are the most optimal state in that
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
they represent a national standard for
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
competency and they work both inside and
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the state uh which is why we
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
advocate for both approaches
 
02:07:49.679 --> 02:07:51.109 align:start position:0%
advocate for both approaches
simultaneously

02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr arnold i think we're moving
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
a little out of scope for this
 
02:07:54.719 --> 02:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
a little out of scope for this
subcommittee

02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chair i appreciate your
 
02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:00.310 align:start position:0%

generosity

much for being great um brian real i
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
represent uh the professional
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters of new hampshire uh we have
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
about 2000 active and retired uh
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters and paramedics
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um i did speak in
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh the hearing the other day so i'm not
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to restate
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony for you all i just wanted
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
to draw some attention to a couple of
 
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.030 align:start position:0%
to draw some attention to a couple of
things

02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
that have kind of caught my ear this
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
morning and while i
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
utterly respect the testimony in favor
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
of replica i think it's important to
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
note that
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing right now
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
is a lot of confusion and a lot of
 
02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
contradictory uh testimony
 
02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:55.710 align:start position:0%
contradictory uh testimony
and

02:08:55.710 --> 02:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:56.950 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
a few examples of that
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
we've stated
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
that this is not intended to be for
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
day-to-day use that this is for
 
02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.069 align:start position:0%
day-to-day use that this is for
um

02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know significant emergencies that
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
the governor does not activate the emac
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
but while you look at the language of
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
the law on the first paragraph it states
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
that it's for
 
02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh day-to-day use uh and the day-to-day
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
movement of personnel uh that's one area
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
that i think that this is causing some
 
02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:24.310 align:start position:0%
that i think that this is causing some
confusion

02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh additionally
 
02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:26.629 align:start position:0%
uh additionally
we

02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:09:29.189 --> 02:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
while i respect uh chief romanello's
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony one of the things that
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
concerns me um is
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh that a lot of this is going to rely
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
on his interpretation of the law
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
while i think that um in many cases
 
02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
fine and and well and just i think that
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
it concerns me uh that the law is not
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated so that we can
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
understand truly what the ramifications
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh of this uh really have for ems
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
providers throughout the state and
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
and thirdly i think that there's been
 
02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
and thirdly i think that there's been
significant

02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:05.910 align:start position:0%
significant
um

02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
contradictory testimony as to whether or
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
not this was used during this pandemic
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
some have stated that it was used and
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
some have stated that it has not been
 
02:10:15.599 --> 02:10:16.870 align:start position:0%
some have stated that it has not been
used

02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
i think what's important to note
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
is that we in fact have not had to
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
utilize the replica model throughout
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
this pandemic
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
we've been under a state of emergency
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
and our ems system has been able to
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
weather the storm
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
and provide
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
ex exemplary service without having
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
glitches in that system and i think a
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
lot of the reason for this is because uh
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're in a very densely populated area
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
here in the new england states where we
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
have a robust uh mutual aid system and
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
mutual aid agreements that are developed
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
and when you start
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these rural
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
communities or you start looking at the
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
midwestern states where um ems services
 
02:11:04.079 --> 02:11:04.950 align:start position:0%
midwestern states where um ems services
are

02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
less densely populated
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's clear that there may be the need
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
for that in those states
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
however we are simply looking for a
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
solution to a problem that we do not
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
have we provide an excellent service as
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
it is without the replica model in use
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it's it's
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know we need to talk about
 
02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.390 align:start position:0%
you know we need to talk about
hypotheticals

02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
you really are doing a disservice to the
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
state when you start uh changing a
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
system that is currently functioning as
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to um so with that i will
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
say that um i uh completely support the
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
repeal of replica and support leaving
 
02:11:45.669 --> 02:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
this as part of
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
the current bill thank you so much thank
 
02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman if uh there are
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
no other witnesses to testify i would
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion and speak to my
 
02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:02.709 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion and speak to my
motion

02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%

go ahead representative roy
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh there being no further testimony at
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
this time i would like to make a motion
 
02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
this time i would like to make a motion
that

02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee make a
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
 
02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:18.149 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
that

02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%

uh they'll be amended so it's the strike

02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm happy to speak to that now if
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%

just to interject i'm sorry mr chairman
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%

raised his hand um
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
late and so he is a panelist i don't

02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
wants to chime in

02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very brief i am legal counsel
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
a replica and also uh for the council of
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
state governments and we strongly
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
support uh new hampshire staying in the
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
compact uh which is a csg priority
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh and the one thing i wanted to comment
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
on briefly is
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
with the scope of practice issue just to
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
put a bow around that testimony i i
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
really think it's important to sort of
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
know that uh there's more and more
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
health professions are moving toward
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice we're seeing
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
differences in state standards of care
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
and state scopes of practice really
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
level off you know compared to where
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
they were 20 years ago where it was more
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know what a medical director sort of
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
favored uh you know kind of this is the
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
way i've always done it sort of practice
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
and evidence-based medicine is really
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
moving ems systems toward a much more
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
standardized practice most of the
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
differences you see are in what kind of
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
equipment you know will we use this
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
particular device and we use that
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
particular device
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh so the medic just you know kind of
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
uses what's available to them so i just
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that comment and and
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's all i wanted to add thank you
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes i like to reintroduce my motion that
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee recommends to the full
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee that section two be amended
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
struck it out in its entirety and i'd
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard testimony from state
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
health officials
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
state ems providers the federal
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
government all in favor of remaining in
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
this contract the only testimony we've
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
heard against it is from the state
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters union
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
um we're not talking about a new bill
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that was already vetted
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
and passed
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
and at the time i don't recall that the
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
firefighters union uh opposed it so vice
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
versa i'm not sure what brought this up
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
speaking of you know a problem fixing a
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist this statue
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
has not caused any problems we've just
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
now started to get it up and running
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
the work of previous committees and
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
everyone that went into getting this
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
involved deserved to
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
let's try this thing and see how it
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
works we're always able to withdraw
 
02:15:29.679 --> 02:15:31.270 align:start position:0%
works we're always able to withdraw
later

02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
i just think that it's
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
when we hear it all the testimony
 
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
it was all upsides that were real worlds
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
it would really benefit military spouses
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
both in the state and out of the state
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
that means new hampshire citizens who
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
were in the military and were stationed
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
in a compact state and vice versa
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
we've heard from ems providers how this
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
can provide
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
real world benefits
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
we've heard that even if the governor
 
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
made an order that would allow
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
expedited licensure we won't be able to
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
review the background of these people in
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
a quick fashion
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't know anything about them
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
this compact addresses that
 
02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
so having heard all that
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
i would just wrap up by saying that
 
02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:15.990 align:start position:0%
i would just wrap up by saying that
again

02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the testimony we've
 
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.950 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the testimony we've
heard

02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
is for this
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
and it provides real world benefits
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
versus the hypothetical negatives from
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
the folks that are against it so thank
 
02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:30.550 align:start position:0%
the folks that are against it so thank
you

02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i concur
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i will be voting
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
i look at this uh i was here when this
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
was passed um there were a number of
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
folks against it at that time um me
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
being one of them and i still am i don't
 
02:16:53.519 --> 02:16:54.629 align:start position:0%
being one of them and i still am i don't
think

02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
um like i stated before
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
having a seat at the table is
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily the right reason to jump in
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be the first in helping make the
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
rules and do
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
such with this compact
 
02:17:06.319 --> 02:17:07.190 align:start position:0%
such with this compact
um

02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
i look at some of the problems i know
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
this is boilerplate language for csg for
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
all of their compacts and i have issues
 
02:17:13.599 --> 02:17:14.469 align:start position:0%
all of their compacts and i have issues
with

02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:17:14.479 --> 02:17:16.070 align:start position:0%
with
that

02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
allowing these compacts to go and
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
purchase lease or
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a mortgage on places we don't know
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
where the money is coming from where
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's going hiring employees
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
the scope of how big this is going to
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
grow or where it's going
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
i also look at what the cost is going to
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
be here to the state of new hampshire as
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
we further on go down the road we heard
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
just the other day in the nursing
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
compact that they've hired their first
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
employee and are growing from that point
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
um after being in place for quite some
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
time and i think all these compacts are
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to be doing the same and that's
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
why this language has put their
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
boilerplate they're meant to grow
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
meant to uh have a fee associated with
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
them and uh have a cost to them um
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
another concern i have uh
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
and looking at this was
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
um these members have qualified immunity
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
defense and indemnification
 
02:18:11.519 --> 02:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
defense and indemnification
um

02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
why they need that i'm not sure why
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
should they be free and clear from shall
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
be immune from suit and liability in
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
their official capacity for any claim or
 
02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:22.389 align:start position:0%
their official capacity for any claim or
damage

02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
damage
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why they need that
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so i have an issue with that that's
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
in all of these contacts about these uh
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
folks that are on a commission
 
02:18:32.399 --> 02:18:33.349 align:start position:0%
folks that are on a commission
um

02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
i also look at um
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
there is language in there that deals
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
with the military it's um that we could
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
easily put into new hampshire statute
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
that says we will assist in
 
02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:45.669 align:start position:0%
that says we will assist in
um

02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
license um in a timely manner
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
for uh those military families if you
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
look at the languages it's a
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to put into new hampshire
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
statutes to make sure we take care of

the compact

isn't needed to do that
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
each state can do that
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
quite simply just by using the language
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:16.950 align:start position:0%

02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
membership of the professional

02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
would anybody like to speak about part
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
four of the bill
 
02:23:41.429 --> 02:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows
 
02:23:41.439 --> 02:23:42.309 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows
um

02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair thank you i used to work at
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
the department of education for 30 years
 
02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:48.950 align:start position:0%
the department of education for 30 years
so

02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
um i'm familiar with
 
02:23:51.439 --> 02:23:52.550 align:start position:0%
um i'm familiar with
this

02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
although i wasn't part of it i'm
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
these two
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
the um i'm familiar with that board
 
02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:01.750 align:start position:0%
the um i'm familiar with that board
and

02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
i think the change to um
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
designate the number of
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
higher education and um k-12 education
 
02:24:11.359 --> 02:24:12.870 align:start position:0%
higher education and um k-12 education
representatives

02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and the split is good
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
because the majority of what they deal
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
with in their book in their work is on
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
the k-12 side
 
02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:23.349 align:start position:0%
the k-12 side
and

02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the second change which just
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
says instead of saying somebody may only
 
02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:29.830 align:start position:0%
says instead of saying somebody may only
serve

02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
serve
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
two terms it says it changes it to be
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
two consecutive terms and i think that's
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely fine there may be
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
somebody who
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
really can contribute a lot and it's um
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
nice to let them come back after a break
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that there's a rotation of
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
people that are sitting on the board and
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
you just don't have the same board all
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:13.309 --> 02:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
myself i you know i didn't
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
i had trouble with this section
 
02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:20.150 align:start position:0%
i had trouble with this section
because

02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
it seems like limitations are being
 
02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:23.590 align:start position:0%
it seems like limitations are being
introduced

02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
so you designate a specific number of
 
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.110 align:start position:0%
so you designate a specific number of
people

02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
did you have a question about it
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
no just it just wasn't my concern
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
can you say that again because i wasn't
 
02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:40.950 align:start position:0%
can you say that again because i wasn't
clear

02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know what you said it seems like
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's limiting it can be
 
02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
it's limiting it can be
elected

02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
oh oh okay um if i can just respond i
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
the way i look at it is it just keeps it
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
may i make a motion
 
02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
um i make a motion to keep this in the
 
02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:23.830 align:start position:0%
um i make a motion to keep this in the
bill

02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
second

02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%

we're restricting the composition of the
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
board and then
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%

so
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
the next part
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%

two

02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
um that would have their hands up sure
 
02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.030 align:start position:0%
um that would have their hands up sure
or

02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
i would probably
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
as far as time goes i would probably
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
break for lunch for an hour between noon
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%

02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
once we're done with this section
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%

um to the red cross
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
and it's at 3 30
 
02:31:24.399 --> 02:31:25.110 align:start position:0%
and it's at 3 30
so

02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%

02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
like at 3 10
 
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.030 align:start position:0%
like at 3 10
and

02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
i did a lot of research on the very last
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
section of this bill the one that has to
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
do with
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%

yep
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
um so it would be possible to to take
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
that up
 
02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:49.750 align:start position:0%

02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
and allow a little bit of time for a
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on that but
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%

02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%

02:32:24.399 --> 02:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
to talk about
section

02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:33.190 align:start position:0%
all right
[Music]

02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
how many members from the public do we
 
02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:35.429 align:start position:0%
how many members from the public do we
have

02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
we have three now we have judy simpson
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
nicole o'malley and susan adams

[Music]
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
so alphabetically it'd be judy simpson
 
02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:48.070 align:start position:0%
so alphabetically it'd be judy simpson
first

02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
if you can limit it to say two minutes
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
because we've had hearings on this
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%

02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
representing slps and the music
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
therapists as well as the legislators so
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're confident that it addresses the
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised last week
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it clearly outlines that music
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
therapists do not replace slps and that
 
02:33:53.349 --> 02:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
if they're working with anyone with a
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
communication disorder that they
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
collaborate and review treatment plans
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
with the slp so
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
we feel like it addresses the concerns
 
02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
that were
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the public hearing and it's
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
our effort to move the section forward
 
02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
so that music therapists can attain
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
licensure in the state i'm open to any
 
02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:12.630 align:start position:0%
licensure in the state i'm open to any
questions

02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i have not received
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
any amendments yet
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
our plan is not to really amend anything
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee but to do so in the
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
so there's time for that
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
so with that something i should send to
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
you directly or to
 
02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
to all of us at edna
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
be happy to do that but like i said it's
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
the language directly just passed in
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
maryland and it was what was requested
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
last week by
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
the asha susan adams who's also on this
 
02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:45.510 align:start position:0%

thank you yeah if yeah
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
the full committee needs to see it
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
because i'm sure it'll be discussed
 
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:54.000 align:start position:0%

government relations representative for
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
the new england region of the american
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
music therapy association i am the
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
director of the music therapy program at
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
the university of rhode island um as
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
well in the task force chair here and
 
02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'm here um to provide an overview rhode
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
island went through similar um
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2014 with our license um
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2015
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
um and the increase in accessibility and
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
frankly the degree program at the state
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
university um would not have been
 
02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
plausible without the licensure there's
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
increase in access
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
we are working with insurance companies
 
02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:46.870 align:start position:0%
we are working with insurance companies
we

02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
co-treat and always have very closely
 
02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:50.870 align:start position:0%
co-treat and always have very closely
with

02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
speech and language pathologists
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
and there have been um
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more access points to
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
clients which is really where this is is
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
coming from you know it's the people
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
that we work
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
um for the people that we serve um that
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
have so many struggles because of the
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
systematic and even misrepresentation we
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
now have increased opportunities for
 
02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
other artists and musicians and there's
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
just been a significant change um
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
over the past five years so i'm here in
 
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:25.520 align:start position:0%

we cannot hear you
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%

02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony uh and of
 
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
course the issue is going to be the
 
02:37:08.309 --> 02:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
language that was just proposed i
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
understand we can't move forward because
 
02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have the actual amendment but
 
02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:13.590 align:start position:0%
we don't have the actual amendment but
uh

02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
is this an issue that you're familiar
 
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:16.950 align:start position:0%
is this an issue that you're familiar
with

02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
who's the question too
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's to the
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
young lady that just spoke
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:37:25.270 --> 02:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right please
 
02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
i am um
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
i again i was the task force chair we
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
had similar challenges and worked with
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
our local asha chapter um judy would be
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
probably more she's our national
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
government relations rep so she is more
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
well-versed as this has come up in
 
02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
other states as well and the language
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
he's proposing again passed in maryland
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
after this has occurred in multiple
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
states my state was before maryland
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
because it was five years ago so um
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
maryland is very very current
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay well you you understand that the
 
02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
okay well you you understand that the
issue

02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman so uh the the
 
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
the issue is whether this language is
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
acceptable because we've all the
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee has already several times
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
supported uh music therapy uh in theory
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
it didn't pass the senate last time
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic situation so the
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
the question is whether the marijuana
 
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
language is acceptable
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
we want to see we see these two uh
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
professions as complementary not
 
02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:29.349 align:start position:0%
professions as complementary not
oppositional

02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
oppositional
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh and so we would like to be sure that
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
we have a true compromise between the
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
music therapists and the speech
 
02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:38.870 align:start position:0%
music therapists and the speech
pathologists

02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
pathologists
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
um so that language is going to be the
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
acceptability of the language is going
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
to be key to us
 
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
so if you can if you can
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
get your colleagues to uh be prepared to
 
02:38:50.399 --> 02:38:51.429 align:start position:0%
get your colleagues to uh be prepared to
uh

02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
contact us before the sub before the
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
full committee meets that would be
 
02:38:55.439 --> 02:38:56.870 align:start position:0%
full committee meets that would be
helpful

02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives do that yeah
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr tim
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds like here we don't really have
 
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
that much to do because right there's an
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendment coming
 
02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:07.590 align:start position:0%
amendment coming
right

02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
i i agree with the full committee right
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
i i agree with your position on the
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
issue not having the amendment but
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
since we have a witness who's testifying
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure we have as much
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
input from them as we can get so thank
 
02:39:21.359 --> 02:39:23.030 align:start position:0%
input from them as we can get so thank

asha
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
and i did also send that language into
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
the full committee after the hearing
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
last week
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
and agree with judy and nicole you know
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is language that we've worked out
 
02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
in maryland that we all agreed to
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know i just it was very important
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
for asha to to make sure that
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
it read that music therapist can't treat
 
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
the communication disorder disorder
 
02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
itself because that's within the scope
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
of practice of speech language
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
pathologists but they can treat an
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
individual with a communication disorder
 
02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:37.840 align:start position:0%

02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.319 --> 02:40:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
ms adams um the problem before was that
 
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
the speech and audio therapists
 
02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
claimed that this was across the border
 
02:40:56.469 --> 02:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
line into their territory do you feel
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
like the amendment addresses that
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes we do we we do believe the amendment
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
addresses that issue
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:16.150 --> 02:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
interviews amendment i guess after this
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
at some point for the full community so
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%

that all parties have come together and
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
agreed to an amendment
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%

02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
brought forward in the full committee
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%

section six
um

02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we have an amendment
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
out there that would solve all the
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought forward um
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing and all these um
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
folks have uh come together in producing
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment um
 
02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:34.950 align:start position:0%
an amendment um
i

02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
wish we could talk about the amendment
 
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
um instead of going to ipl um
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
so i will vote against the unexpedient
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
this would just like to add that that i
 
02:43:53.269 --> 02:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
agree with that i think we should give
 
02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
the full committee opportunity to hear
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment it might change
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
our vote is advisory
 
02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:10.550 align:start position:0%
our vote is advisory
so

02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think that will be done if the
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
amendment is sent to the full committee
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%

this section is related to
 
02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
determining if people mostly seniors
 
02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
will qualify
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
for community care
 
02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:01.269 align:start position:0%
for community care

are an important part of
 
02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:13.110 align:start position:0%
are an important part of
this

02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:14.790 align:start position:0%
this
process

02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:17.910 align:start position:0%
process
so

02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
um right now the people who can
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
make this determination by just
 
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
assessing the um
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
the condition and
 
02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:31.110 align:start position:0%
the condition and
the

02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:32.630 align:start position:0%
the
like

02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:47:35.429 --> 02:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
home like personal hygiene and living
 
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
skills that the client has
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
the the group of people who can do that
 
02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:42.790 align:start position:0%
the the group of people who can do that
is

02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:43.590 align:start position:0%
is
uh

02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
fairly broad and it can include
 
02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
nurses but it can also include
 
02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:53.190 align:start position:0%
nurses but it can also include
doctors

02:47:53.190 --> 02:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
02:47:56.389 --> 02:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
physical therapists
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
almost anybody who's been giving
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know reasonable
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
significant care to this individual and
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably knows them the best can make
 
02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
restricts it
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
to being just registered nurses
 
02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:17.830 align:start position:0%
to being just registered nurses
so

02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm not sure that
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
i i guess i can't speak to what was the
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
intent of the sponsor
 
02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:26.389 align:start position:0%
intent of the sponsor
but

02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
by restricting it is cutting many people
 
02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:31.670 align:start position:0%
by restricting it is cutting many people
who

02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
who could provide a good assessment of
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
to a registered nurse who might not even
 
02:48:41.269 --> 02:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
be familiar with that person's um
 
02:48:41.279 --> 02:48:42.710 align:start position:0%
be familiar with that person's um
situation

02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
so i see
 
02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
no upside to doing this
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
and only a downside because it just
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know puts
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
burden it makes more work for registered
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
nurses which we always have a shortage
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
of and there's no benefit of this to the
 
02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:02.630 align:start position:0%
of and there's no benefit of this to the
client

02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
client
 
02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:03.990 align:start position:0%
client
so

02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:10.150 --> 02:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
on this section i i'm
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
not sure what to do um this to me should
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
be in the health and human services
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
committee it's well above beyond our
 
02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
purview on edna
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
i know i watched a hearing yesterday
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
that was in resources and
 
02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
it was a three-part bill that pertained
 
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
to both fish and game resources and
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture and there
 
02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
were people from
 
02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
all committees attending that
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
to answer the questions and address the
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
issue and i just wish we could have the
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
same happen here because i think the
 
02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee
 
02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
would have
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
much more input and
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
are better to make a decision on this
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
section than we are
 
02:50:04.469 --> 02:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
um so i i i'm asking that the chair
 
02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
reached out to someone from health and
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
human services from the committee and uh
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
get some input
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i do agree with
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative goldie's suggestion that
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:29.030 --> 02:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony was quite clear uh in the in
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
the initial hearing
 
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
that this is not a question of treatment
 
02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:34.870 align:start position:0%
that this is not a question of treatment
where

02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
the expertise the medical training and
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
expertise of a registered nurse uh is
 
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate and even essential
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is a question of
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
a uh
administrative

02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh review of
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
um of documentation and so forth uh
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
having nothing to do with treatment and
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
and for which the
 
02:51:03.269 --> 02:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
individual doing
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
sorting if you will almost
 
02:51:08.399 --> 02:51:09.269 align:start position:0%
sorting if you will almost
is

02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
is being overseen
 
02:51:12.429 --> 02:51:12.439 align:start position:0%
uh by
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
a further
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
higher pay grade and training level
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh so i think that this
 
02:51:24.230 --> 02:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill is not appropriate
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
but i think we would benefit from having
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh somebody from health and human
 
02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:30.150 align:start position:0%
uh somebody from health and human
services

02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:30.950 align:start position:0%
services
uh

02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
you know confirm what the testimony
 
02:51:33.439 --> 02:51:35.110 align:start position:0%
you know confirm what the testimony
showed

02:51:35.110 --> 02:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
showed
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:39.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
mcguire

02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
i just resent to the full committee
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
a letter i got from
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
chair pearson of the health and human
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
services committee i reached out to him
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
and he responded with a
 
02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:01.190 align:start position:0%
and he responded with a
um

02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
an analysis of this part of the bill
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and he is strongly against
 
02:52:07.429 --> 02:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
removing it
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
he thinks it's he is strongly in favor
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
of removing it so that we can have the
 
02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
perform these tasks and not limit it
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to registered nurses of
 
02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you i did send it uh late last
 
02:52:33.830 --> 02:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i have it now and thank you
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry i i didn't send it earlier
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
i just got it yesterday
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to
 
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
confer with the chair again uh
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that that
 
02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
i was unclear about what your
 
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation is
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
at at one point
 
02:52:58.720 --> 02:52:59.510 align:start position:0%
at at one point
uh

02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
you are
 
02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
you are
the

02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
the chair of hhs is in support of
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
removing this section from the bill if i
 
02:53:09.750 --> 02:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly that is correct
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
you are absolutely correct
 
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
he thinks we should remove it
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
because it is it has a chance of harm
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
and no real benefit
 
02:53:18.399 --> 02:53:19.670 align:start position:0%
and no real benefit
so

02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i agree with him
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
well the the testimony was pretty clear
 
02:53:27.190 --> 02:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
that that hap requiring a
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
registered nurse is not necessary for
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
the function that's being performed at
 
02:53:35.349 --> 02:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
this level uh it's not a question of
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
treatment where you need medical
 
02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:38.389 align:start position:0%
treatment where you need medical
training

02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad for that clarification thank
 
02:53:40.800 --> 02:53:41.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad for that clarification thank
you

02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:46.230 align:start position:0%
i think
um

02:53:46.230 --> 02:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
motion did you want to hear from the two
 
02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public that want to speak
 
02:53:57.830 --> 02:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
or are you
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to not do that i i think we're
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
pretty clear in the subcommittee what we
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
want to do here okay i just wanted to
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
double check thanks mr chair i make a
 
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
motion to itl take this out of the bill
 
02:54:14.230 --> 02:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'll second that
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
would you like to stick to the motion or
 
02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:54:22.150 --> 02:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
i think i think um what i said and
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
which uh representative maguire said
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
better than i did
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
that um we're all set
 
02:54:32.469 --> 02:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.830 --> 02:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
mr uh representing the dollar anything
 
02:54:38.389 --> 02:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh i think enough has been said and i i
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
am uh happy with the response we got
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
from the chair of the health and human
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
so this would be
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate motion on
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
i vote yes just for clarification though
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
this ipl means we would be striking this
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
from the bill correct
 
02:55:06.399 --> 02:55:10.309 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
i i would like to say that um i did a
 
03:59:59.910 --> 03:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
lot of research on this bill
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does or this section
 
04:00:07.030 --> 04:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill does is it puts in statute
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the food code requirement
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
related to a food
 
04:00:15.030 --> 04:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
protection manager
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
being on the premises at food food
 
04:00:19.750 --> 04:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
establishments and and food
 
04:00:19.760 --> 04:00:21.990 align:start position:0%
establishments and and food
establishments

04:00:21.990 --> 04:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
includes a lot a lot of places
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
includes grocery stores and convenience
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
stores but
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
i think think of it mostly in terms of
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
applying to restaurants
 
04:00:36.550 --> 04:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
and after my research
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
i've come to the conclusion that we do
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
not need
 
04:00:41.279 --> 04:00:42.950 align:start position:0%
not need
this

04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
section because there's no need for
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
there to be a statute
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
related to
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
exceptions to
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
the food code requirement
 
04:00:55.750 --> 04:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason we don't need
 
04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
we don't need it is is because there is
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
already a process in place
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
hhs has a procedure
 
04:01:08.469 --> 04:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
that applies to food safety codes and
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
actually other
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
rules that they have
 
04:01:12.239 --> 04:01:13.990 align:start position:0%
rules that they have
that

04:01:13.990 --> 04:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
will allow
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
an establishment to
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
apply for
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
what what i would call a variance to the
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
rules they need to comply but they may
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
be able uh the hhs can
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
approve them to apply in and
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
comply in an alternative manner
 
04:01:36.000 --> 04:01:37.269 align:start position:0%
comply in an alternative manner
so

04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
we heard from aroma joes and
 
04:01:44.309 --> 04:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
one of their concerns was that they have
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
so few employees and they also serve a
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
very limited
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
menu they only serve like coffee and
 
04:01:51.600 --> 04:01:52.710 align:start position:0%
menu they only serve like coffee and
bagels

04:01:52.710 --> 04:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
bagels
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that it would be very difficult for
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
them to have a person
 
04:02:00.150 --> 04:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
that was qualified on the premise all of
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
the time and and i absolutely agree with
 
04:02:03.120 --> 04:02:04.790 align:start position:0%
the time and and i absolutely agree with
that

04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:04.800 --> 04:02:05.750 align:start position:0%
that
but

04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
they do not need to put this in statute
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
because health and human services the
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
food safety bureau has um can grant them
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
an exception to do exactly what they
 
04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
asked us to do and my understanding is
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
they already have
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
that exception
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
what you know what i call a variance
 
04:02:26.000 --> 04:02:26.790 align:start position:0%
what you know what i call a variance
and

04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
i think to put it in statute
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
the way it's constructed the section 13
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
it would help aroma joes but
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
really going to help um
 
04:02:42.239 --> 04:02:43.269 align:start position:0%
really going to help um
other

04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:02:46.150 --> 04:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
other food service establishments
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
because the only exception they're
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
making is based on the number of
 
04:02:49.439 --> 04:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
making is based on the number of
employees

04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
04:02:53.199 --> 04:02:54.950 align:start position:0%
and we have
plenty

04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
plenty
 
04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
we have places that have more than five
 
04:02:57.760 --> 04:02:59.189 align:start position:0%
we have places that have more than five
employees

04:02:59.189 --> 04:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
but would legitimately qualify for a
 
04:03:04.150 --> 04:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
variance an example of that would be a
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
place that um serves only ice cream and
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
ice cream related
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
items and
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for their any of their
 
04:03:13.279 --> 04:03:14.469 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for their any of their
employees

04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:03:15.750 --> 04:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
to know
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
the part of um
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
the what the food protection manager
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
needs to know about
 
04:03:22.560 --> 04:03:24.469 align:start position:0%
needs to know about
storing

04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
storing
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
and handling raw meat because they have
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely none of that so they could
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
apply for an exception that would let
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
them have
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
10 employees if they can work out a plan
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
with hhs that
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
they can ensure that their employees
 
04:03:43.110 --> 04:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
will be properly handling
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
ice cream and milk and that sort of um
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
those sort of products
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
so we need
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
something that will help all food
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
service establishments but at the same
 
04:03:59.349 --> 04:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
time protect the public
 
04:03:59.359 --> 04:04:00.870 align:start position:0%
time protect the public
um

04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
one of the the way this this is
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
constructed right now
 
04:04:08.229 --> 04:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
this would exempt
 
04:04:08.239 --> 04:04:09.269 align:start position:0%
this would exempt
small

04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
small
 
04:04:12.309 --> 04:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
restaurants that serve seafood including
 
04:04:14.950 --> 04:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
raw oysters and things like that as long
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
as they didn't have more than five
 
04:04:19.590 --> 04:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
food service workers so i don't think
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's in the best interest of the
 
04:04:21.199 --> 04:04:22.150 align:start position:0%
that's in the best interest of the
public

04:04:22.150 --> 04:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:04:25.830 --> 04:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
the process that we have in place right
 
04:04:30.309 --> 04:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
now in rules i think can accommodate
 
04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns and the challenges that
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
food service establishments have and at
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
health and human services in the food
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
service bureau will be able to protect
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:04:44.399 --> 04:04:45.590 align:start position:0%
the public
from

04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:04:45.600 --> 04:04:46.870 align:start position:0%
from
potential

04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
potential
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
poisonings and in that sort of thing so
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is to
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
completely remove this section
 
04:04:58.150 --> 04:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
because everything is already in place
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes senator gaida has his hand up but i
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
um hello senator uh well would you
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%

04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee representative
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i can uh ask after the
 
04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%

all right
please

please
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the subcommittee
 
04:05:59.680 --> 04:06:01.269 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the subcommittee
um

04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm the sponsor of this section of the
 
04:06:03.120 --> 04:06:04.550 align:start position:0%
i'm the sponsor of this section of the
bill

04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
and there's some
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
um errors in the testimony of
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative fellows this bill does
 
04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
not exempt any establishment from the
 
04:06:13.120 --> 04:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
not exempt any establishment from the
rules

04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the safety and
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
let's give a little bit of background
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
the hardest hit industries in this state
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
are the restaurant hotel industries from
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
and a very significant number
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:34.239 --> 04:06:36.550 align:start position:0%
 
businesses

04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
were not able to qualify for the ppp
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
loans and other things and so
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
first of all there's a labor shortage
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
second of all there's high turnover in
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
the food service industry
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so the effect the attempt of this
 
04:06:50.309 --> 04:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
legislation is to protect those small
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that all of us have in our
 
04:06:51.920 --> 04:06:53.030 align:start position:0%
businesses that all of us have in our
towns

04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay uh all it says is that instead of
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
what hhs has to require on-site a food
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
service manager
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
by the way the cost of training those
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
managers is on the business of three
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a pop
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then a high turnover like it's
 
04:07:10.560 --> 04:07:12.070 align:start position:0%
and then a high turnover like it's
expensive

04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
this bill just says that a manager a
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
food safety manager has to be part of
 
04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
the business
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
but doesn't have to be on site and there
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
are a lot of small businesses including
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
in plymouth
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
where they have fewer than five five or
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
fewer people that actually handle the
 
04:07:27.359 --> 04:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
fewer people that actually handle the
food

04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
food
 
04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay and so this is an attempt number
 
04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
one to bring relief to businesses number
 
04:07:33.040 --> 04:07:34.070 align:start position:0%
one to bring relief to businesses number
two

04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
i worked for a year and a half with hhs
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
which in fact backed this
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill this section of the bill in
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
testimony they supported it
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
i spoke with john williams about it
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay they supported this so i'm somewhat
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
concerned that this may be an attempt to
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
undermine what the department had
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
originally intended
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's no harm done by this
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
it helps our small businesses it
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
requires the same degree of safety it
 
04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
permits the same levels of inspections
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
it just says that the small businesses
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
with five or fewer people that handle
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:07.750 align:start position:0%
with five or fewer people that handle
food

04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
food
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay don't have to have a food safety
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
manager on site
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
and the reason that's put in statute
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
is because
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
hhs did not want to deal with it
 
04:08:18.880 --> 04:08:19.990 align:start position:0%
hhs did not want to deal with it
okay

04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
their excuses that well we haven't
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
enforced this law because of the
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we're just kind of being
 
04:08:28.150 --> 04:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
lenient but the point is
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
this public does not suffer
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
because of this law but the small
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that are struggling do in
 
04:08:37.110 --> 04:08:37.120 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and i guess i have a
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
question asked as to whether
 
04:08:52.150 --> 04:08:52.160 align:start position:0%

joe's
 
04:09:26.710 --> 04:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
are they currently under hss regulations
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
required to have a certified person on
 
04:09:30.640 --> 04:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
required to have a certified person on
site

04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
site
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
and is am i correcting
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
understanding your testimony that by
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
putting this in statute they would in
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
the future only have to have one
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
as a member of the as a member of the
 
04:09:42.399 --> 04:09:43.269 align:start position:0%

04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
franchise
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question uh
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
they may have applied for a waiver
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
but annually applying for a waiver okay
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
is is more work for a small business
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
several dozen outlets in the state
 
04:10:05.110 --> 04:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
this statute i don't want it to sound as
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
though it is is exempting only them from
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
the requirement to have a manager on
 
04:10:14.790 --> 04:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
site it's any business
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
the problem came to my attention uh when
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
constituent roma joes in fact called me
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
and said this is really tough to cost
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost us tens of thousands
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
of dollars a year
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
to maintain the on-site person
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that's when that was in the genesis
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
of this uh of this
 
04:10:31.359 --> 04:10:33.030 align:start position:0%
of this uh of this
legislation

04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
but in no way accepts a single business
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's any small business as stated in the
 
04:10:38.239 --> 04:10:42.860 align:start position:0%
it's any small business as stated in the
statute

04:10:42.860 --> 04:10:42.870 align:start position:0%

from from having and and having the way
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's worded in this statute
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
it says that they need a food service
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
food protection manager on staff it says
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
nothing about how often they have to
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
visit the kitchen they could be on staff
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
and go there twice a year
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
do you think that that's protecting the
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
safety of the public
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative i think you completely
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstand the intent of business is
 
04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
not to be irresponsible
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
okay and i suspect that if a small
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
business poisoned somebody they'd be out
 
04:11:48.550 --> 04:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
of business very quickly
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
okay this is
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
this does not in any way
 
04:11:52.640 --> 04:11:54.070 align:start position:0%
this does not in any way
reduce

04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
and the presence of a certified food
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
safety manager does not anyway guarantee
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
the safety of the food being served
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
this is about not eliminating the
 
04:12:06.309 --> 04:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
standards not exempting businesses
 
04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
from the standards or the inspections
 
04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
this is about exempting businesses from
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
the requirement to have a person on site
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
the regulations remain the same the
 
04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
inspections remain the same etc
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%

04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman dr senator for
 
04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:12:43.760 --> 04:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
taking my
um

04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
real quickly just as an example let's
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
say i wanted to open a business tomorrow
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh selling
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
coffee and donuts and bagels or what
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
have you under the current regulation i
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
would have to have
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
someone certified on site at all times
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
under your proposed legislation i would
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
just have to have for example me be
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
certified but i would not have to be
 
04:13:06.870 --> 04:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
there at all
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that would not exempt me from any of
 
04:13:11.110 --> 04:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
the food health regulations
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
it just means that i wouldn't have to
 
04:13:15.429 --> 04:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
have someone on staff
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
there at all times because
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
just having someone there does not
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
require them to do any extra safety
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
precautions merely that they're
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
certified in their is that correct
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:33.860 --> 04:13:33.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:35.510 align:start position:0%
thank you

04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the kid meet

colleen smith i'm the administrator for
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
the food protection section within the
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
you have regarding this legislation
 
04:13:55.359 --> 04:13:57.349 align:start position:0%
you have regarding this legislation
representative

04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:14:02.790 --> 04:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for uh being with us today
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
mike mike first question and i have a
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
few my first question is can you tell me
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
it says food establishments having five
 
04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
food employees can you give me what's
 
04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
the definition of five foods food
 
04:14:15.120 --> 04:14:16.630 align:start position:0%
the definition of five foods food
employees

04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
so there is a definition in the food
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
code for a food employee and that is an
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
employee that is
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
in involved in working with unpackaged
 
04:14:29.110 --> 04:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
food food equipment or utensils or food
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
contact services so it wouldn't
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
waiter waitress server unless they had
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
other responsibilities such as making
 
04:14:38.399 --> 04:14:39.910 align:start position:0%
other responsibilities such as making
salads

04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
salads
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
or desserts or some other types of food
 
04:14:42.720 --> 04:14:45.349 align:start position:0%
or desserts or some other types of food
preparation

04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
preparation
 
04:14:46.229 --> 04:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:54.550 --> 04:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
is there currently a
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
process in place
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
for waivers
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
for individuals for businesses such as
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
aroma joes
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
so we do have the ability to grant
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
variances to our rules there's an
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
application form for the variants the
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
the applicant would explain what rule
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
they're requesting a variance for and
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
then also put in
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
what measures that they would put in
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
place to be equally protective of public
 
04:15:20.800 --> 04:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
place to be equally protective of public
health

04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.760 --> 04:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:15:30.870 --> 04:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
so in the circumstance of a business
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
such as aroma joe's that has numerous
 
04:15:36.960 --> 04:15:38.229 align:start position:0%
such as aroma joe's that has numerous
um

04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
shops around the state would that be one
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
variance it would have to be for each
 
04:15:42.239 --> 04:15:43.830 align:start position:0%
variance it would have to be for each
individual

04:15:43.830 --> 04:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
so each individual establishment would
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
be expected to apply for their own
 
04:15:50.239 --> 04:15:53.590 align:start position:0%
be expected to apply for their own
variants

04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you follow one more follow-up
 
04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
all right hello
 
04:15:58.720 --> 04:15:59.510 align:start position:0%
all right hello
is

04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
i know when we had the public hearing
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh originally
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
that there was discussion about
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
something being worked on in rule making
 
04:16:10.239 --> 04:16:11.189 align:start position:0%
something being worked on in rule making
um

04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i just want to go back to that is is
 
04:16:15.910 --> 04:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
that a viable option versus what we have
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned during my testimony
 
04:16:22.630 --> 04:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
during the hearing we are we were
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
working both tracks the legislation and
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
amending our rules to mirror what is set
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you

yes thank you mr chairman
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is mike sullen from aroma joe's
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
coffee i would like to comment um on one
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
of the questions that representative
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
goalie has just asked colleen i would
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
like the subcommittee to understand that
 
04:16:53.600 --> 04:16:54.790 align:start position:0%
like the subcommittee to understand that
um

04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
every city in new hampshire
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
um have their own health inspectors so i
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
want the subcommittee to understand the
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
variance is available
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
through hhs for the cities that use
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
state health inspectors
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that have their own
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
health inspectors
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
some will recognize
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's variants some require
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
their own variance to this rule
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make sure that
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
everyone understands that that if you do
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
if you are operating in a town that has
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
its own health inspector which aroma
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
joe's does
 
04:17:39.030 --> 04:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
i have received the same variants from
 
04:17:41.110 --> 04:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
rochester new hampshire but there are
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
other cities um that are
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
unsure what they want to do with it
 
04:17:49.110 --> 04:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
they're unsure of even of how to enforce
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
this rule and they're unsure of whether
 
04:17:53.110 --> 04:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
they'll allow a variance
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
to happen so i
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to just be subject to the
 
04:17:59.840 --> 04:18:00.870 align:start position:0%
i don't want to just be subject to the
rule

04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
rule
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
where that's why i really am hoping that
 
04:18:05.910 --> 04:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
a statute can can arise from this so
 
04:18:09.110 --> 04:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
that it's it's a state law not leave it
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
up to the individual districts to make
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative terry roy
 
04:18:22.710 --> 04:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have a question
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
for uh hss colleen if i could
 
04:18:25.359 --> 04:18:26.229 align:start position:0%
for uh hss colleen if i could
um

04:18:26.229 --> 04:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
i was wondering
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
um about how many variance requests they
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
received a year
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
is it only good for a year
 
04:18:34.560 --> 04:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
is it only good for a year
and

04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
are they ever denied
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
so i i would say um total we probably
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'd estimate 20 maybe 20 variances that
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
we would give a year we have the ability
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
within our rule to have them long to be
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
long a year
 
04:18:53.680 --> 04:18:55.189 align:start position:0%
long a year
and

04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:55.199 --> 04:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
and
there

04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
um there may be instances
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
we would
 
04:19:01.110 --> 04:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
deny them
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
like for instance
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
we have often we have had uh places that
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
don't have running water and so we
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't allow a place to do
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
any kind of food prep or apply for a
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
variance without running water
 
04:19:15.750 --> 04:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
that would be an example of a variance
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:22.710 --> 04:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
it might be just quick follow-up um what
 
04:19:25.110 --> 04:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
about this specific regulation regarding
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
having the personalized staff on site
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
so we have the requests that we've had
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
to this requirement have have only come
 
04:19:36.389 --> 04:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
from aroma joe's up to this point but as
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
senator gaiden mentioned this is a very
 
04:19:40.710 --> 04:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
fairly new requirement and due to the
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have been
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
very slow to be able to
 
04:19:45.520 --> 04:19:46.469 align:start position:0%
very slow to be able to
to

04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry and just i just want to put
 
04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
one point of clarification is the
 
04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
statute is worded it is only applicable
 
04:20:00.319 --> 04:20:02.389 align:start position:0%
statute is worded it is only applicable
to

04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:05.110 --> 04:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
food establishments that are licensed
 
04:20:08.630 --> 04:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
under dhhs the self-inspecting 15
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting communities that mr
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
cylin referred to as the statutes
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
written this this does not apply to them
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's only those that are regulated by
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
mike zillen if you have a comment on the
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
previous conversation please
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
i do thank you and thank you colleen for
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
that clarification i would like the
 
04:20:42.070 --> 04:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to know though in most
 
04:20:44.550 --> 04:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
instances in my experience
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
all of the cities and towns that
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
self-inspect look
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
look to the state to see what they're
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
doing so even though they would not be
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
subject to this same rule they they are
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
enforcing it and they look like
 
04:20:59.110 --> 04:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
rochester for example
 
04:20:59.120 --> 04:21:00.389 align:start position:0%
rochester for example
um

04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
said well what is the state allowing you
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
to do and i said they're allowing me to
 
04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
apply for a variance and he said okay
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
can you send me the same stuff so i
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
literally sent him everything that i
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
sent to hhs and conquered
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
to bob vino's office in rochester and he
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
allowed me
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
to get the same yearly variance and
 
04:21:20.790 --> 04:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm afraid of even though
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
they may not be
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're not subject to it they certainly
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
look to conquered uh in making those
 
04:21:27.120 --> 04:21:28.950 align:start position:0%
look to conquered uh in making those
decisions

04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
um yes i i just wanted to ask
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
ms smith if if she feels comfortable in
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
putting into
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
the rsa that
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
that a restaurant
 
04:21:45.439 --> 04:21:46.630 align:start position:0%
that a restaurant
that

04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
prepares raw
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
seafood you know serves raw seafood and
 
04:21:52.399 --> 04:21:55.349 align:start position:0%
seafood you know serves raw seafood and
um

04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
is she okay with those people not having
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
a food
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
food protection manager
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
on site when food is being prepared
 
04:22:06.960 --> 04:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
on site when food is being prepared
because

04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you're not going to do that
 
04:22:13.830 --> 04:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
what's the point of having any food
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
answer if you
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
if you have an answer
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
i do just want to point out that we um
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
even if this establishment has five
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
employees are less on duty they do have
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
to have that one certified food
 
04:22:36.389 --> 04:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
protection manager
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
on staff we do feel very strongly that
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
there is a strong correlation to having
 
04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
that that trained educated person on
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
staff to be able to um
 
04:22:47.040 --> 04:22:48.070 align:start position:0%
staff to be able to um
install

04:22:48.070 --> 04:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
install
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
systems within the food establishment to
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
be able to run it safely when they're
 
04:22:53.110 --> 04:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
not there
 
04:22:55.110 --> 04:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
when that person in charge that's the
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
certified food protection manager is not
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
there there would be you know certainly
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
other um
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement tools at our disposal should
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
we find a particularly violative
 
04:23:09.510 --> 04:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
food establishment we could remedy that
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
you know more training or more education
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
is needed based on a poor compliance
 
04:23:17.110 --> 04:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
history should we find during inspection
 
04:23:17.120 --> 04:23:17.910 align:start position:0%
history should we find during inspection
that

04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
um you know the that things aren't in
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
place in the absence of that certified
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
food protection manager so we feel
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
that having the one person on staff is
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
is very important and that
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
should the situation arise that there
 
04:23:34.870 --> 04:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
means where we could request that other
 
04:23:40.389 --> 04:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
employees are also trained
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand for example
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
that bed and breakfasts have been
 
04:23:59.830 --> 04:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
exempted since day one
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh the small restaurant establishments
 
04:24:03.680 --> 04:24:04.710 align:start position:0%
uh the small restaurant establishments
again

04:24:04.710 --> 04:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
to emphasize they are not exempted from
 
04:24:09.269 --> 04:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
the requirements for sanitation
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
what they're exempted from is the
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
requirement the very expensive
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
requirement in a very high turnover
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
environment of food service workers of
 
04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
repeatedly training workers time after
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
time after time when they go to other
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
places the certification does not follow
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
the worker certification
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
is is i'm sorry it follows the worker
 
04:24:28.710 --> 04:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't stay at the establishment and so
 
04:24:28.720 --> 04:24:29.429 align:start position:0%
doesn't stay at the establishment and so
that

04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
that food safety manager position is
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
important they don't just stand there
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
and watch
 
04:24:37.110 --> 04:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
they develop a program for the business
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
that is reviewed by hhs for its
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
compliance with with the requirements
 
04:24:42.309 --> 04:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
for safety of food
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that is their responsibility as a
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
business and hhs manager there are some
 
04:24:50.469 --> 04:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
i think 8 000 businesses of this type in
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
again we're looking at a significant
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
number of training costs for a lot of
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
these small restaurants
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
the restaurant association supports this
 
04:24:59.520 --> 04:25:01.590 align:start position:0%
the restaurant association supports this
bill

04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
they understand the toughness of
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
business environment and these small
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
businesses to begin with and the extra
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
cost that this would bring that would
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
cause more harm to an already devastated
 
04:25:11.279 --> 04:25:12.469 align:start position:0%
cause more harm to an already devastated
industry

04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
this causes no no less safe
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
presentation of food or preparation of
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
food by the public again the standards
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
remain it's just the requirement for a
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
person sitting there a food service
 
04:25:24.790 --> 04:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
manager could be a cook it could be a
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper it could be whomever they
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
don't stand there and watch
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
the issue is the training of the
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
employees and a manager that is part of
 
04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
the ownership of the company as opposed
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
to a food service manager requirement on
 
04:25:35.040 --> 04:25:36.229 align:start position:0%
to a food service manager requirement on
site

04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
site
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
is equally
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
invested in making sure that they do the
 
04:25:42.630 --> 04:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
right thing and hhs has invested and
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
performed the inspections to ensure the
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with those standards and when
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
those compliance standards are not met
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
it just takes responsible action
 
04:25:52.389 --> 04:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm not sure
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
who to address this question too uh
 
04:26:04.229 --> 04:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
hearing mentioned that there are several
 
04:26:04.239 --> 04:26:05.830 align:start position:0%
hearing mentioned that there are several
localities

04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
localities
 
04:26:05.840 --> 04:26:07.030 align:start position:0%
localities
that

04:26:07.030 --> 04:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
the state does not inspect or would not
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
need to comply with health and human
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
services would driscilla still need to
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
request waivers
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
from each of those communities even if
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:32.950 --> 04:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
my excellent list
 
04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for the question
 
04:26:36.790 --> 04:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative um colleen if you're
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
still there i i certainly would value uh
 
04:26:41.429 --> 04:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
your opinion on this i can speak to my
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
experience with the towns that i have
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
stores in
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
is yes they do allow us to apply for a
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
variance i in the one city that i have
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
five stores in rochester new hampshire
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
they granted me that same variance that
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
the state granted me in the other cities
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
that we operate in don't for dover for
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
instance in portsmouth
 
04:27:06.000 --> 04:27:06.790 align:start position:0%
instance in portsmouth
they

04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
are aware of the rule
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
they their interpretation of the rule is
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
that i would that i do not um
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
i do not fall into a category where
 
04:27:20.550 --> 04:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
they're worried about enforcing this
 
04:27:20.560 --> 04:27:21.429 align:start position:0%
they're worried about enforcing this
rule

04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
rule
 
04:27:21.439 --> 04:27:22.469 align:start position:0%
rule
so

04:27:22.469 --> 04:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
that that's that's the most simple way
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
that i can answer that question
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
some municipalities that self-inspect
 
04:27:32.710 --> 04:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
are requiring a variance others have not
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
required it
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
but that could change at any time i that
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's why i i'm trying to stay away
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
from the rules they can be changed or
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
interpreted by many different people
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
different health inspectors once they
 
04:27:48.550 --> 04:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
turn over let's say you know jamie
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
leaves dover and a new health inspector
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
and wants to enforce this rule i'd have
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
to start the variance process with them
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
and who knows if that person will will
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
allow me
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so as a member of
 
04:28:10.399 --> 04:28:11.269 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so as a member of
uh

04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
15 years standing on the gel car i'm
 
04:28:16.710 --> 04:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
wondering is there a
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
because the of course the rules have the
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
same effect as the statute they've
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
fully uh
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
have the force and effect of law the
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
only thing about rules is that they have
 
04:28:31.750 --> 04:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
to originate from a statute the agency
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
can't make determinations on its own
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
independent of the statutory
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
requirements uh so my question would be
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
whether there is uh
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
for miss smith the question is uh is
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
there something missing in the statute
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
currently uh that that this bill would
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh would
 
04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
would uh replace or would uh
 
04:28:54.960 --> 04:28:56.070 align:start position:0%
would uh replace or would uh
uh

04:28:56.070 --> 04:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
no as i mentioned before we do um we do
 
04:29:03.680 --> 04:29:04.469 align:start position:0%
no as i mentioned before we do um we do
have

04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
the the pieces in place to
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
do the rule making we've already filed
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact statement with the lba
 
04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're just so currently within that
 
04:29:16.630 --> 04:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
section of the rule talking about
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
certified food protection managers we
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
have exempted certain facilities from
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
that requirement
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
for instance the bed and breakfasts as
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
senator guida had mentioned earlier the
 
04:29:31.110 --> 04:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
retail stores without food preparation
 
04:29:33.750 --> 04:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
such as a rite aid a cumberland farms a
 
04:29:33.760 --> 04:29:34.710 align:start position:0%
such as a rite aid a cumberland farms a
um

04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
a dollar general that they are not
 
04:29:36.640 --> 04:29:37.910 align:start position:0%
a dollar general that they are not
currently

04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
required to have that certified food
 
04:29:42.389 --> 04:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
protection manager and so we would be
 
04:29:44.469 --> 04:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
looking just to expand that section of
 
04:29:47.110 --> 04:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
the rule and again it mirrors the our
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
proposed language mirrors that is what's
 
04:29:51.510 --> 04:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
set forth in the statute
 
04:29:51.520 --> 04:29:52.630 align:start position:0%
set forth in the statute
follow-up

04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay so in other words you're going to
 
04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
be coming before the jail car
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh with a a proposed rule change
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
which clearly you can't do unless it's
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
based on a statute as i said earlier uh
 
04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
so you're in the process of developing
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
those rules as we speak
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay and and that follow up again mr
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
chairman so that that the is uh it's not
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
dependent on the whether this statute
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.469 --> 04:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
you couldn't be at developing a rule
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
based on a perspective statute you can
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
only base it on an existing statute so
 
04:30:36.550 --> 04:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
my question is uh for you know for the
 
04:30:37.990 --> 04:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
those who are not familiar with the gel
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
card process
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me that that you're
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
currently developing a rule based on
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
existing statutes that would resolve
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
do you have anybody
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
members of else
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh representative fellows
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
um yes for for miss um
 
04:31:02.880 --> 04:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
um yes for for miss um
smith

04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
smith
 
04:31:04.880 --> 04:31:06.229 align:start position:0%
smith
so

04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
what sort of criteria
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
like i know that already
 
04:31:13.110 --> 04:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
bed and breakfasts and the places you
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
talked about that just basic in dollar
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
general that just have basically that
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
prac that packaged food
 
04:31:20.080 --> 04:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
prac that packaged food
they're

04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:31:21.120 --> 04:31:22.870 align:start position:0%
they're
exempt

04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
now and there's no reason that they
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
would not
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
be exempt
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
from the food protection
 
04:31:33.349 --> 04:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
protection manager also
 
04:31:33.359 --> 04:31:34.469 align:start position:0%
protection manager also
but

04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
isn't the criteria that
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
those places ended up on that exemption
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
list didn't that don't doesn't that have
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
to do with the safety
 
04:31:46.469 --> 04:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
related to the food items that they're
 
04:31:50.070 --> 04:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
serving and that the pro the possibility
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
of those
 
04:31:51.680 --> 04:31:52.349 align:start position:0%
of those
being

04:31:52.349 --> 04:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
contaminated and making somebody sick is
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
extremely low
 
04:31:57.600 --> 04:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
extremely low
and

04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:59.279 --> 04:32:00.389 align:start position:0%
and
isn't

04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
04:32:02.710 --> 04:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
an exemption that's based on the number
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
of workers
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
very different from
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
that criteria
 
04:32:12.870 --> 04:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.880 --> 04:32:14.309 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:32:14.319 --> 04:32:15.189 align:start position:0%
yes
please

04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:32:18.790 --> 04:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
sure sure so currently the those types
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
of establishments that i mentioned that
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
have no food preparation so they're
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
exempt from the certified food
 
04:32:25.040 --> 04:32:26.309 align:start position:0%
exempt from the certified food
protection

04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
manager requirement altogether
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
um you know as the language and the
 
04:32:31.520 --> 04:32:32.469 align:start position:0%
um you know as the language and the
proposed

04:32:32.469 --> 04:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:32:32.479 --> 04:32:33.750 align:start position:0%
proposed
bill

04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:32:37.110 --> 04:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
mentions and also in in our rule they
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
would those the types of establishments
 
04:32:41.189 --> 04:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
that would have the
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions is just for the presence at
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
all hours of operation they still are
 
04:32:48.229 --> 04:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
going to need to have that certified
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
food protection manager on staff but in
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
these certain instances where
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's only reheating food or handling
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
ready-to-eat food or the instances of
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
the the five employees are or fewer they
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
have to have that person on on staff
 
04:33:06.080 --> 04:33:07.189 align:start position:0%
have to have that person on on staff
still

04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
still
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
yeah so on staff
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
tell me how often they have to be well
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
you will say how often they have to be
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the establishment because on staff
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
especially if you're dealing with a
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
bigger company that has multiple sites
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
that could be one person
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
on staff
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
apparently in
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
in the head office
 
04:33:34.639 --> 04:33:35.990 align:start position:0%
in the head office
doing

04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:33:36.000 --> 04:33:37.189 align:start position:0%
doing
accounting

04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
might be certified and that person
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
how often do they have to go and visit
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
the kitchens that we're talking about
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to make sure are
 
04:33:48.150 --> 04:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
operating safely
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
we we didn't put that level of
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
specificity on the on staff as far as
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
having an in
 
04:33:55.840 --> 04:33:56.551 align:start position:0%
having an in
a

04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
facetime or an actual um in
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
establishment presence
 
04:34:01.840 --> 04:34:02.789 align:start position:0%
establishment presence
um

04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:04.709 --> 04:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
you know however the expectation would
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
be is that they
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
that presence to be able to
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh staff were were trained
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately according to their duties
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
having at least um that
 
04:34:21.510 --> 04:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
one um person that has gone through the
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
training and educated in food safety on
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
on their employee
 
04:34:27.680 --> 04:34:30.470 align:start position:0%
on their employee
roster

04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
any more discussion
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
on part 13
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
right senator guida please
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:34:46.639 --> 04:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
at the apparent failure to understand
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
the rigors of doing business
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and those that are opposed to moving
 
04:35:02.949 --> 04:35:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
the certification evaporates when the
 
04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
employee leaves the business not even
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
transferable to the next business that
 
04:35:10.470 --> 04:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
incurs a cost on any subsequent business
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that person might need to be worked
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
in okay and once again this does in no
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
way diminish
 
04:35:17.189 --> 04:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
the safety
 
04:35:17.199 --> 04:35:18.551 align:start position:0%
the safety
requirements

04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
the degree of inspections the number of
 
04:35:20.320 --> 04:35:21.670 align:start position:0%
the degree of inspections the number of
inspections

04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
it puts the responsibility for running
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
the business on the business and the
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for responsibly running
 
04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
the business on a very small business in
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
a segment of our end of our of our
 
04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
state's economy that has been devastated
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
04:35:37.119 --> 04:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
okay and
again

04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
you have to come to grits with a
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
fundamental question
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay who is most qualified to run that
 
04:35:43.920 --> 04:35:45.269 align:start position:0%
okay who is most qualified to run that
business

04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
who wants that business to succeed
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
and who's interested in levying further
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
unnecessary government regulations and
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
restrictions and costs on the businesses
 
04:35:57.269 --> 04:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
that are struggling as we speak
 
04:35:58.629 --> 04:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's fundamentally what's at stake
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
here this bill causes no harm whatsoever
 
04:36:03.990 --> 04:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
this bill in fact helps small businesses
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
that are complying will continue to
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
comply because if they fail to comply
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
the 8 000 food businesses or however
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
many of those are exempted
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
by this statute
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
okay from having an on-site manager not
 
04:36:18.789 --> 04:36:18.799 align:start position:0%
exempted from the standards okay this
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
helps those businesses including
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
businesses in plymouth including
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
businesses in warren including
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
businesses all over the state
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
people that are struggling that didn't
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
qualify for the ppp loans or the main
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
street loans
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay this is about keeping our economy
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
strong not sacrificing in any way
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
the quality of food produced the safety
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the production
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
or the responsibility of the owners of
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
the businesses to make sure that their
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
safety programs are in place
 
04:36:47.670 --> 04:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%

representative fellows did you have a
comment

04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
oh that's fine
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
okay please i would like to say that my
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
parents owned a business
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
and my family owned restaurant
 
04:37:05.840 --> 04:37:07.269 align:start position:0%
and my family owned restaurant
businesses

04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
and i have worked in many restaurants
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
i understand the struggle
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
of small businesses
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
and i also understand the safety issues
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
of restaurants
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
and restaurants when they're inspected
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
that happens maybe once a year maybe it
 
04:37:28.390 --> 04:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
may be in those larger cities it's more
 
04:37:30.390 --> 04:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
than once a year but generally once a
 
04:37:30.400 --> 04:37:31.510 align:start position:0%
than once a year but generally once a
year

04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:37:31.520 --> 04:37:33.269 align:start position:0%
year
and

04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
that is not very good protection for the
 
04:37:36.719 --> 04:37:37.830 align:start position:0%
that is not very good protection for the
public

04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:37:37.840 --> 04:37:39.590 align:start position:0%
public
if

04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
for somebody to show up once a year is
 
04:37:41.680 --> 04:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
for somebody to show up once a year is
very

04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.029 --> 04:37:49.039 align:start position:0%
low level of protecting the public and
 
04:37:49.039 --> 04:37:50.310 align:start position:0%
low level of protecting the public and
illnesses

04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
illnesses
 
04:37:50.320 --> 04:37:51.590 align:start position:0%
illnesses
and

04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
i've i three years ago i had i was
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
served in a restaurant a um
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
serving of steamed mussels that included
 
04:38:03.990 --> 04:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
two that were not open
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
and two that were cracked which is
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely not within the food service
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
standards and it's very disturbing that
 
04:38:17.349 --> 04:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
that would even happen but a once once a
 
04:38:20.470 --> 04:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
year inspection is not going to
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
address that issue
 
04:38:22.639 --> 04:38:23.670 align:start position:0%
address that issue
so

04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:26.789 --> 04:38:26.799 align:start position:0%
there's a very big value for having this
 
04:38:26.799 --> 04:38:28.070 align:start position:0%
there's a very big value for having this
requirement

04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
that are certified as food protection
 
04:38:32.879 --> 04:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
that are certified as food protection
managers

04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
managers
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
in the kitchen
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
in health and human services and the
 
04:38:38.160 --> 04:38:40.470 align:start position:0%
in health and human services and the
local

04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
inspectors have an opportunity to grant
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate waivers and i would hope
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
that their
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
waivers are based on the level of threat
 
04:38:53.670 --> 04:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
of the food that's being served and not
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
on how many people are there
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm just concerned about public
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
safety and i'm
 
04:39:00.160 --> 04:39:01.269 align:start position:0%
safety and i'm
very

04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
um disappointed that senator geider
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be concerned much about
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:39:11.920 --> 04:39:13.029 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
senator

04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
senator
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.760 --> 04:39:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:39:19.590 --> 04:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:19.600 --> 04:39:21.269 align:start position:0%
the
requirements

04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
remain in place
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the business
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a food site
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
manager on site
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
okay and by the way less than 500
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
incidents a year out of 8 000
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
restaurants in the state
 
04:39:36.561 --> 04:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
restaurants in the state
okay

04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:39:38.160 --> 04:39:38.948 align:start position:0%
okay
so

04:39:38.948 --> 04:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
once again it's the question of more
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
regulations on business that are not
 
04:39:43.120 --> 04:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
regulations on business that are not
necessary

04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
because the current standards serve just
 
04:39:49.110 --> 04:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
fine they have up until this point
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
in fact the rules that are brought in by
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
hhs are not even federally mandated
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
they're suggested
 
04:39:55.760 --> 04:39:56.788 align:start position:0%
they're suggested
right

04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
so the question again before you is
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
in passing this legislation
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
you are neither reducing
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
for the public
 
04:40:11.120 --> 04:40:12.150 align:start position:0%
for the public
nor

04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
nor
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
the diligence required of the business
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
you are in fact reducing
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
the costs to the business
 
04:40:22.230 --> 04:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
and the onus on the business of
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
continuing to comply with paperwork year
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
after year
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
continue to deal with the high turnover
 
04:40:27.760 --> 04:40:29.350 align:start position:0%
continue to deal with the high turnover
rate

04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
and and for which the certification
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
disappears once an employee leaves
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
we are building a more building a bigger
 
04:40:36.000 --> 04:40:37.430 align:start position:0%
we are building a more building a bigger
bureaucracy

04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
04:40:39.430 --> 04:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
that does nothing to increase the safety
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
of the establishments
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
but in fact levy's considerable costs
 
04:40:46.150 --> 04:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
and paperwork on them
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
and is unnecessary
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
this bill does not exempt anyone from
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
any requirements how many times we have
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
and in food service management
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
establishments where the food service
 
04:40:58.788 --> 04:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
manager safety managers on site
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
they cannot possibly watch every food
 
04:41:00.718 --> 04:41:01.670 align:start position:0%
they cannot possibly watch every food
service

04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
serving portion
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
and and delivery
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're there in a management capacity
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
for a safety program they do their own
 
04:41:10.240 --> 04:41:12.390 align:start position:0%
for a safety program they do their own
inspections

04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
they don't sit behind the desk somewhere
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
and not because they care about the
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
business respect the business owners
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
allow them the responsibility which has
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
produced no problems this far without
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
this regulation
 
04:41:26.230 --> 04:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
so we don't need it at this point for
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
those small businesses the number of
 
04:41:29.750 --> 04:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
employees once again does not exempt
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
them from the standards it just says
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
you're small enough that we respect the
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
costs that this brings okay and we
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
understand that you are going to be
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
responsible because in the business
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
world when people get sick in the food
 
04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
business it soon goes away
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
you need to respect the owners of the
 
04:41:47.110 --> 04:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
business government does its job this is
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh regulation that would
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
require that food service managers
 
04:41:53.430 --> 04:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
presence on site thank you mr chairman
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:41:58.000 --> 04:41:59.990 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:00.000 --> 04:42:01.110 align:start position:0%
um
if

04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're done discussing it i'd like to
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
to recommend this part
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh otp
 
04:42:10.958 --> 04:42:12.150 align:start position:0%
uh otp
second

04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of confusion
 
04:42:19.750 --> 04:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
between towns and um
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
the small shops do not really deserve to
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
be forced into
 
04:42:24.160 --> 04:42:25.910 align:start position:0%
be forced into
begging

04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
begging
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
for an exception every time day to day
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
even could you speak up a little louder
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes um
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just saying that the small shop
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
should not be forced into building for
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
this exception every time
 
04:42:42.390 --> 04:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh department rules change and i would
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
like to move this determination into
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
statutes the regulation of
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
food protection managers that's why i'm
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
making this motion thank you
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
i would um
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i would uh second what you said i
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:43:01.990 --> 04:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
this regulation
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
at this point i have heard no evidence
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
why it's necessary
 
04:43:08.788 --> 04:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
it's an undue burden on small businesses
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
and there does seem to be some confusion
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
about requirements between localities
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the state
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
and seeing as the voluntarily on the
 
04:43:20.070 --> 04:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
federal portion
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
i just don't see especially right now
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
why we should be putting more
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh weight on small businesses trying to
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
survive so high second year motion after
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
so representative fellows
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
um yes i would just like to speak to
 
04:43:48.390 --> 04:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
04:43:48.400 --> 04:43:49.510 align:start position:0%
your motion
and

04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
if it or ought to pass i see issues with
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
it related to definitions
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
we don't have a definition of
 
04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
food employees
 
04:44:07.200 --> 04:44:08.550 align:start position:0%
food employees
so

04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is in statute there's no way
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
somebody would be able to
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
know if that covered the wait staff or
 
04:44:16.240 --> 04:44:18.070 align:start position:0%
know if that covered the wait staff or
or

04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:44:18.080 --> 04:44:19.510 align:start position:0%
or
not

04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:44:19.520 --> 04:44:21.590 align:start position:0%
not
and

04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:25.110 --> 04:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
also the requirement to have
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
food protection manager on staff
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
i believe also needs some kind of
 
04:44:30.718 --> 04:44:32.310 align:start position:0%
i believe also needs some kind of
clarification

04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
because staff where staff at that
 
04:44:37.990 --> 04:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
establishment and just something that
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
says something about how often they
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually go there just to so that you
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're not on staff and
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
in they
 
04:44:47.360 --> 04:44:48.310 align:start position:0%
in they
never

04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
never
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know they visit twice a year
 
04:44:51.120 --> 04:44:52.150 align:start position:0%
you know they visit twice a year
because

04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
the food service the inspectors that go
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
need some kind of standard to know if
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're doing what
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
the intent is for those
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
um food protection managers to do which
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
is be training those staff that work
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
there to adhere to the food
 
04:45:11.040 --> 04:45:12.948 align:start position:0%
there to adhere to the food
code

04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
i yeah
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
all right i would love senator to
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
provide some guidance on that
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
good questions senator please

thank you
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
in fact every every term in that
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is defined
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:36.390 --> 04:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
everything that needs to be done has
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
been done
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:45:41.040 --> 04:45:42.550 align:start position:0%
uh the
um

04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
specious requirement
 
04:45:51.030 --> 04:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
that a food service manager must appear
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
so many times once again delves into
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
over-regulating businesses and again i
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
business people do not want to fail
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
they invest their life savings
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%

we're in the voting mode that is correct

04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
if you had an answer for representative
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%

04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
better addressed in the full committee
 
04:46:17.040 --> 04:46:18.070 align:start position:0%
better addressed in the full committee
if

04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%

she had to leave my executive director
 
04:48:21.680 --> 04:48:22.390 align:start position:0%
she had to leave my executive director
oh

wanted to bring to the subcommittee's
 
04:48:39.270 --> 04:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
attention um
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%

services
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
we may need to add a
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
section that
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
states that lnas that have completed
 
04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%

04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
deemed to have taken a board approved
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
course i believe that this will
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
this is necessary to comply with uh the
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for medicare
 
04:49:12.320 --> 04:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
requirements for medicare
um

04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
would you if you have text would you
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
send it to the full committee please
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:29.920 --> 04:49:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:31.600 --> 04:49:32.948 align:start position:0%
representative
fellows

04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes i just for mr broderick i'm just
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph two
 
04:49:46.000 --> 04:49:47.270 align:start position:0%
paragraph two
about

04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
it says not withstanding any provision
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
of law to the contrary the state
 
04:49:54.628 --> 04:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
approved training program
 
04:49:57.510 --> 04:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
for licensed nurses nursing assistants
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
shall take into account training and
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
experience required
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:50:07.110 --> 04:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
for that i'm i'm a little confused
 
04:50:07.120 --> 04:50:09.030 align:start position:0%
for that i'm i'm a little confused
because

04:50:09.030 --> 04:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
the training programs
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
when i looked up the statute i think i
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
was looking
 
04:50:15.760 --> 04:50:16.948 align:start position:0%
was looking
um

04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
i think i was looking at nursing board
 
04:50:19.120 --> 04:50:20.310 align:start position:0%
i think i was looking at nursing board
rules

04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:50:20.320 --> 04:50:21.350 align:start position:0%
rules
the

04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:50:24.390 --> 04:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
the training programs
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
are one option
 
04:50:26.400 --> 04:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
are one option
for

04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
somebody to get certified and those
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
programs are like the programs offered
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
at the community colleges
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
that require something like
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
40 hours of classroom time and
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
60 hours of clinical
 
04:50:46.948 --> 04:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
and the other option for
 
04:50:46.958 --> 04:50:48.788 align:start position:0%
and the other option for
um

04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
lnas is
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
kind of like a apprenticeship like on
 
04:50:55.030 --> 04:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
the job
 
04:50:59.110 --> 04:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
two hours 200 hours
 
04:51:01.110 --> 04:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
so those are the two options and i just
 
04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
don't state approved training program i
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
i'm broderick uh may i defer to my
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
executive director lindsay courtney um i
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
she's a little more involved in the the
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
board of nursing
 
04:51:18.878 --> 04:51:19.910 align:start position:0%
board of nursing
piece

04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
piece
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
all right lindsay courtney
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh for the record
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
lindsay courtney office of professional
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
so um there really is one way um to
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
obtain licensure status as an lna
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
um it's through attending a board
 
04:51:40.390 --> 04:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
approved education program that consists
 
04:51:44.070 --> 04:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
of a hundred hours um and the reason for
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
that is even though that the the state
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire can regulate nurses and
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants and basically however
 
04:51:51.120 --> 04:51:51.990 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants and basically however
um

04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know format they choose
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
there are um cms regulations that limit
 
04:51:59.350 --> 04:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
the ability for
 
04:52:01.750 --> 04:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
um long-term care long-term care
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
facilities to be reimbursed um to those
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
individuals who have um obtained
 
04:52:08.550 --> 04:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
specific training and the specific
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
training is that it has to be approved
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
basically by a board or a state-approved
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
training program so
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
um essentially all uh lnas have to go
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
through a state-approved training
 
04:52:20.320 --> 04:52:21.430 align:start position:0%
through a state-approved training
program

04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
we have a number of
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
lna programs um some at community
 
04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
colleges so you know we partner with um
 
04:52:30.868 --> 04:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
some private entities as well in order
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
to prove that the the concern that i
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
have with this particular statutory
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
provision is twofold it's it's somewhat
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
confusing it the it seems to um i think
 
04:52:43.510 --> 04:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
the intent is to allow those temporary
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
health partners to transition to
 
04:52:45.200 --> 04:52:46.470 align:start position:0%
health partners to transition to
licensure

04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
on just by completing 100 hours of
 
04:52:48.798 --> 04:52:50.230 align:start position:0%
on just by completing 100 hours of
experience

04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
um if that's the case then there needs
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
to be some language in there as attorney
 
04:52:56.310 --> 04:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
broderick mentioned
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
such that they shall have been deemed to
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
complete uh a board-approved program
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they won't be eligible
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
um for reimbursement or the facilities
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
for which they work the second provision
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
of this is somewhat confusing because it
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
essentially directs
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:53:14.230 --> 04:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
training programs to take into
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
consideration previous work performed
 
04:53:17.040 --> 04:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
consideration previous work performed
um

04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
those programs
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
they can develop their own curriculum
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
subject to board of nursing regulations
 
04:53:26.708 --> 04:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
so i guess it's not clear to me um
 
04:53:28.470 --> 04:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
to what extent and how they would take
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
that into consideration so i think that
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
that needs um you know
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
further clarification
 
04:53:35.830 --> 04:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
question represented
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
well basically you're saying you're
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
confused by the same thing that i was
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
confused by okay so
 
04:53:43.680 --> 04:53:45.430 align:start position:0%
confused by okay so
so

04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:48.150 --> 04:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
what do you think is the path forward i
 
04:53:48.160 --> 04:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
what do you think is the path forward i
mean

04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
do you feel comfortable with just saying
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll just
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
consider those 100 hours
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
this the same as
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
a state-approved
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
sound really great
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're the same i can
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
tell you what the discussion was at the
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
time that the emergency order was
 
04:54:16.878 --> 04:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
time that the emergency order was
issued

04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
issued
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
the emergency order itself was the
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
result of a lot of collaboration the
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
board of nursing and the agency were
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about the
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
original idea and proposition which was
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
to allow individuals with eight hours of
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
a webinar experience to function as an
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
lna because we didn't think that was
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate in order to protect the
 
04:54:35.760 --> 04:54:36.708 align:start position:0%
appropriate in order to protect the
public

04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
the um collaboration and the compromise
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
was that these individuals could assist
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
lnas and obtain experience essentially
 
04:54:46.550 --> 04:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
like making beds and that sort of thing
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult to assess you know the
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
levels of experience that they obtained
 
04:54:52.868 --> 04:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
and in order to assess the
 
04:54:54.550 --> 04:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications so
 
04:54:57.190 --> 04:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
what the stakeholders concluded was that
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing would work with the
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
programs themselves um in order to
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
develop a situation and approval where
 
04:55:07.270 --> 04:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
where the schools could take into
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
consideration prior experience perhaps
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
less than the amount of hours required
 
04:55:11.920 --> 04:55:12.948 align:start position:0%
less than the amount of hours required
or

04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:55:12.958 --> 04:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
or
or

04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
allow them to utilize prior experience
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
um to
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
constitute 60 hours of their clinical
 
04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
work because presently 40 hours of those
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
have to be in person learning which is
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
not represented here in the statute so
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
so what what is the status of that
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
we have not had um uh in a program
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
petition the board of nursing at this
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
point in time in order to modify program
 
04:55:43.590 --> 04:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
approval to take into consideration
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
these temporary health partners
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:55:52.830 --> 04:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
golly you mr chair and i just voiced the
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
same concerns um
 
04:56:00.550 --> 04:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
as representative fellows and
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
um as i look at this this is
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
only for those
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
temporary health partners who have um
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
completed this prior to uh april of this
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
year um
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
so it's it's
 
04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
just for a few individuals um that
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
worked um
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic but i'm not sure
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
the term temporary health partner um
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think we just continue to look at
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
nursing homes cannot get the help they
 
04:56:37.270 --> 04:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
need in the lnas because they don't pay
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
enough and i think by creating this
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
temporary health partner we've um even
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
produced lower wages um in the
 
04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
healthcare field and i think it's going
 
04:56:48.550 --> 04:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
to be more difficult to find uh
 
04:56:48.560 --> 04:56:49.910 align:start position:0%
to be more difficult to find uh
replacements

04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
replacements
 
04:56:54.628 --> 04:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
for the for those uh positions um so i'm
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think there's some issues with this
 
04:56:55.920 --> 04:56:57.030 align:start position:0%
i think there's some issues with this
section

04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:56:58.470 --> 04:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to hear a little more about
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
it but um
 
04:57:04.070 --> 04:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
as of right now i'm not sure about
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh voting on it as is
 
04:57:07.830 --> 04:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:57:07.840 --> 04:57:09.190 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
fellows

04:57:09.190 --> 04:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
um yes i i don't even know
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
who to tell
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
this to but what what i would like to
 
04:57:18.310 --> 04:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
see in place of this is something that
 
04:57:20.310 --> 04:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
says like those
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
temporary health
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
partners can for free
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
take the course
 
04:57:28.948 --> 04:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
take take the course at the community
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
college or with whomever wants to offer
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
it to them and that the state pays their
 
04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
tuition and pays for their books and
 
04:57:41.350 --> 04:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
pays for the the exam fee for them so
 
04:57:43.510 --> 04:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't cost them anything but
 
04:57:45.350 --> 04:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
then we'll know that there that they
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
meet all the standards for
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
that um position
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's what i'd like to see i don't
 
04:57:53.910 --> 04:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
think we can just i don't know if we can
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
stick that in the billing
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
not in the subcommittee but right
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
04:58:07.750 --> 04:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
04:58:07.760 --> 04:58:09.510 align:start position:0%
yes yes
representative

04:58:09.510 --> 04:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
i would liken this to a battlefield
 
04:58:13.990 --> 04:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
promotion and i think this
 
04:58:15.670 --> 04:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative goalie struck right on it
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
that it's a very few people within a
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
very constrained period of time that are
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
getting this so
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i think you know they didn't go
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
to west point but they're getting a
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.550 --> 04:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.638 --> 04:58:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
any

04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
any videos yep
 
04:58:41.520 --> 04:58:43.110 align:start position:0%
any videos yep
yeah

04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
and the fellas
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we're so we're still not addressing
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the medicaid
 
04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
issues see cms i guess because
 
04:58:55.270 --> 04:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're not addressing the cms issue
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
because if we don't do something
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
different with what we have here
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
then those people
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
if they go to work in a nursing home the
 
04:59:08.830 --> 04:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home won't be able to get the
 
04:59:08.840 --> 04:59:10.628 align:start position:0%
nursing home won't be able to get the
medicaid

04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
payments for those positions so i i
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
think we we absolutely can't just pass
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
it the way it is we have to do
 
04:59:18.958 --> 04:59:20.070 align:start position:0%
it the way it is we have to do
either

04:59:20.070 --> 04:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
take it out or
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
which which lines are we talking about
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see that but yes please
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you the only thing i was going to
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
say is to representative fellows points
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
and there are um reimbursement programs
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
that were recently expanded it used to
 
04:59:48.550 --> 04:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
only be reimbursement directly to
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
the um applicant
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
attending the program but now we
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
actually reimburse um in conjunction
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
with cms and dhhs
 
05:00:00.788 --> 05:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
the programs themselves that it can
 
05:00:03.750 --> 05:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor individuals to go through so for
 
05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
moat for many people if not most people
 
05:00:08.310 --> 05:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
that you know they do have eligibility
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement the problem is just
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
finding bodies willing to take the
 
05:00:12.160 --> 05:00:13.910 align:start position:0%
finding bodies willing to take the
program

05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
does it cover all the costs
 
05:00:16.160 --> 05:00:17.110 align:start position:0%
does it cover all the costs
the

05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
fees and the books and everything
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i i would like to get back to
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
you on the specifics of that i do know
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we in the office do verify
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
attendance um so that checks go out and
 
05:00:31.270 --> 05:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
i it's somewhere in the couple thousand
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
dollar range but i can give you
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.550 --> 05:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just uh one quick
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
question and it may also
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh could be fixed in an amendment
 
05:00:59.350 --> 05:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
portion but uh looking at this seeing
 
05:01:02.230 --> 05:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
all of this will take place to those um
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
who are in uh by april 1st of 2021
 
05:01:13.360 --> 05:01:15.190 align:start position:0%
who are in uh by april 1st of 2021
um

05:01:15.190 --> 05:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
that this says it takes effect 60 days
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't we just amend that to be uh
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
take effect upon passage um i don't know
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
why we need to wait 60 days if these
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
folks have already done their hours and
 
05:01:32.550 --> 05:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
completed everything
 
05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
i agree and maybe miss courtney could
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
answer whether they could do it upon
 
05:01:36.638 --> 05:01:38.390 align:start position:0%
answer whether they could do it upon
passage

05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
passage
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
i would like that too but yes please
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
miss court
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
i don't see any problems with it
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
legal problems with it being effective
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
upon passage
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
i provided that you make those changes
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the reimbursement
 
05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
issues and tom and i can get you some
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
language if if that would be helpful
 
05:02:02.708 --> 05:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just have a
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
question um we're talking about this
 
05:02:15.270 --> 05:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um
 
05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know what the potential cost
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
of that would be and
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
it does uh have that in their budget
 
05:02:23.280 --> 05:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
it does uh have that in their budget
because

05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's been no money appropriated for
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.110 --> 05:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
probably miss courtney again
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
um since you know most about the money
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
where is it coming from
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
so for the most part it comes um we
 
05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
it comes from dhhs as part of the cms
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so it's tied into cms
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to the state
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
i'd have to get back to you with
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
specifics um
 
05:02:55.030 --> 05:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not coming from state general
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.958 --> 05:03:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
but if we expanded it to cover
 
05:03:04.948 --> 05:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
everything representative fellow
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
suggested books fees
 
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
and all this for these these folks that
 
05:03:09.600 --> 05:03:10.868 align:start position:0%
and all this for these these folks that
the

05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
this statute would contemplate would
 
05:03:19.030 --> 05:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
i i think we'd have to look into that
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
close you know
 
05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
closely i don't know that dhhs
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think we first need to determine
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what the expenses are um i
 
05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
believe it's all expenses but i think we
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
need to determine what the expenses are
 
05:03:35.190 --> 05:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
and then secondly what you know what
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
they can do for reimbursement
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
um we are reimbursing at a pretty good
 
05:03:40.560 --> 05:03:41.350 align:start position:0%
um we are reimbursing at a pretty good
rate

05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:03:41.360 --> 05:03:42.150 align:start position:0%
rate
um

05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:42.160 --> 05:03:43.190 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's available from a cms
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
perspective most likely it would have to
 
05:03:49.350 --> 05:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
be you know the agency itself would have
 
05:03:50.550 --> 05:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
some of that i assume
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
so i i had in mind an amendment of my
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
own so the 60-day passage is very yeah i
 
05:04:09.990 --> 05:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
would like to take that out in full
 
05:04:12.788 --> 05:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
committee and make it up on passage i
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
also was looking to remove the april
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
first date
 
05:04:17.520 --> 05:04:18.868 align:start position:0%
first date
completely

05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
completely
 
05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
because that's past and because we're
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
still on the pandemic battlefield
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
since we need more bodies on the
 
05:04:27.600 --> 05:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
since we need more bodies on the
battlefield

05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
battlefield
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
i would like
 
05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
who is able to help
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
and go through this program
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
to be there
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
this way we'll tie
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
the status of temporary health partner
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
to the end of the emergency order 42 or
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
the lifting of the
 
05:04:46.798 --> 05:04:48.310 align:start position:0%
the lifting of the
restrictions

05:04:48.310 --> 05:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
so my proposal proposed amendment for
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
the full committee will be to remove
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
if if there's no if there's no more
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'll make another motion of otp to
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
recommend this part
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
with further amendments potentially
 
05:05:24.320 --> 05:05:27.190 align:start position:0%
with further amendments potentially
coming

05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'll second
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.360 --> 05:05:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%

letter of concern is that um
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
a description that you see in other
 
05:08:58.958 --> 05:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
a description that you see in other
statutes

05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
05:09:01.200 --> 05:09:02.310 align:start position:0%
statutes
or

05:09:02.310 --> 05:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
is that unique is going to be a unique
 
05:09:04.798 --> 05:09:05.830 align:start position:0%
is that unique is going to be a unique
thing

05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
so um i couldn't point you in a
 
05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
direction but it is something we've seen
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
in other statutes um in the in the
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
reason why if i could just explain
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
briefly um there you know the benefit of
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
the letter of concern is right now if in
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
fact there's a finding
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
that does not substantiate a an action
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the future so revocation or
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
suspension of a license the only
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism that the commissioner has
 
05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
would be to suspend or
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
revoke a license in the past and and
 
05:09:41.910 --> 05:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what we we've used uh this
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
would give another you know mechanism
 
05:09:45.030 --> 05:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
another tool to say all right there's a
 
05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
letter of concern in the file um
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
as opposed to actually take that action
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:00.390 --> 05:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
05:10:04.390 --> 05:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you explain the
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
necessity to change um
 
05:10:10.230 --> 05:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
between a
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
shell issue and a may issue please
 
05:10:16.708 --> 05:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
that may be the question to the chief
 
05:10:16.718 --> 05:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
that may be the question to the chief
certainly

05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:10:20.470 --> 05:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
this this was in line with other
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
language so the um
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
for nursing and for physicians uh and
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so we thought it would be a good
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity at this point to get in line
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
with the other uh boards as far as those
 
05:10:36.550 --> 05:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
that discipline providers uh in in
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers
 
05:10:38.000 --> 05:10:39.190 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers
uh

05:10:39.190 --> 05:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:41.590 --> 05:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
i know there was some question in
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing where you know
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
could there be a case where the the
 
05:10:49.350 --> 05:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh you know chose to not uh
 
05:10:52.628 --> 05:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
issue and issue a uh some sort of action
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
when when an investigation found the
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
necessity for that um and i don't think
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
that that this would be the case it's
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
just uh providing an an option
 
05:11:05.190 --> 05:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh i guess an example would be used is
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:11:09.510 --> 05:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know we we encourage local medical
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
directors uh and local agencies to
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
to to first deal with issues as they
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
they um
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
they avail themselves uh and then it
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
escalates to a state level so there
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
there could be a case where a a local um
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh unit and the medical director through
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the medical resource hospital agreement
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
had put somebody on we'll say a
 
05:11:35.510 --> 05:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
restrict their ability to
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
to practice uh aside from under a mentor
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
or some sort of preceptor and in the
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
course of the investigation
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh we may have found a finding but in
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
that duration of time they've already
 
05:11:55.030 --> 05:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
remedied the situation um and so at that
 
05:11:56.550 --> 05:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
point you know they've already kind of
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
met a penalty uh and it's been
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately mitigated in the same
 
05:12:02.230 --> 05:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
manner that we would with we'll say a
 
05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
letter of concern and some sort of
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
educational requirements
 
05:12:10.470 --> 05:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
um you know in in in a investigation and
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
discipline for that so
 
05:12:13.750 --> 05:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know that would be the only time
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
that i would say that we may not at that
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
time issue some sort of uh
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
or the commissioner may choose not to
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
issue a revocation suspension or a
 
05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
letter of concern
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh where there's already been a
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
punishment at the local level or not a
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
punishment but a corrective action they
 
05:12:32.070 --> 05:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
should say you're stand corrected
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:38.550 --> 05:12:38.560 align:start position:0%

how this fit with house bill

the

05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
most of it is totally unrelated

most of it is totally unrelated
but

05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%

05:15:52.718 --> 05:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
within a shop
and

05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%

05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is the house position
 
05:15:58.470 --> 05:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i would i had i would like to
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
recommend that we amend
 
05:16:04.230 --> 05:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
the word or to and or which will mean
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
that there is no conflict with
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 575. i've given the senate an
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to 575 that says if this
 
05:16:13.120 --> 05:16:16.628 align:start position:0%
amendment to 575 that says if this
passes

05:16:16.628 --> 05:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
their section
 
05:16:22.948 --> 05:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh roman 1 would not apply
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
because this is a more
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
um more thorough amendment
 
05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
the and or is the only difference that
 
05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
would make a difference
 
05:16:36.788 --> 05:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
i hope that's clear if not i'll answer
 
05:16:36.798 --> 05:16:38.470 align:start position:0%

the psychologists just want to remind
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee of an existing issue
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
that you heard about at the hearing and
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
that is in regards to rsa 329 d
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
which is the scipact
 
05:20:19.110 --> 05:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
that is currently in our statute
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
obviously and
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
is in fact the controlling statute on
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
telehealth services
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
where other state
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
providers live in siteback states
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
so to avoid confusion our request is is
 
05:20:35.750 --> 05:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
just adding the 329d language as an
 
05:20:35.760 --> 05:20:37.190 align:start position:0%
just adding the 329d language as an
exemption

05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
05:20:39.190 --> 05:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
in the language before you
 
05:20:40.868 --> 05:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's i believe two places that that
 
05:20:45.510 --> 05:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
we would recommend that be done i have
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
that language drawn up that i would be
 
05:20:48.788 --> 05:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
happy to send to the committee
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
subcommittee excuse me uh you know the
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
full committee for that full community
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%

section

05:20:55.830 --> 05:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:20:57.910 --> 05:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
but you have uh some changes
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we're we're fine with this section
 
05:21:01.590 --> 05:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
because every state in the united states
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
is not cypack so there may be some
 
05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
psychologists who would benefit from
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
this but scipac clinicians would already
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
be covered by this
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%

05:22:40.560 --> 05:22:41.830 align:start position:0%
license for
a

05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
someone coming in from the state out of
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
state to do telehealth as someone
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
licensed here
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
the standard of care really should be
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
the same no matter what
 
05:22:51.360 --> 05:22:52.150 align:start position:0%
the same no matter what
um

05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure why we have sort of
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
lesser standards
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
for this telepass um as we do for our
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
full licensure
 
05:23:02.160 --> 05:23:03.750 align:start position:0%
full licensure
um

05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's about it
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i was going to
 
05:23:15.840 --> 05:23:17.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i was going to
um

05:23:17.830 --> 05:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
raise my concerns the same as mr
 
05:23:21.510 --> 05:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
broderick on that um i remember that
 
05:23:23.110 --> 05:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
during the testimony
 
05:23:24.788 --> 05:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not this
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
truly is needed or
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
we are already pretty much covered under
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
one more quick
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh for mr broderick is that does that
 
05:23:54.958 --> 05:23:56.868 align:start position:0%
uh for mr broderick is that does that
mean

05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
those coming
 
05:23:58.240 --> 05:23:59.110 align:start position:0%
those coming
in

05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
doing telehealth from out of state will
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
be paying an additional fee is that what
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
i heard you say
 
05:24:04.958 --> 05:24:05.990 align:start position:0%
i heard you say
um

05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
for this the telepaths the proposed
 
05:24:08.400 --> 05:24:09.750 align:start position:0%
for this the telepaths the proposed
telepaths

05:24:09.750 --> 05:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
telepaths
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes so my understanding and i should say
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
this was drafted by the board of
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
psychologists who is a board under
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
oplc's umbrella um my understanding is
 
05:24:21.270 --> 05:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
it would be a
 
05:24:22.868 --> 05:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
they would be charged a
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
fee to come in
 
05:24:27.270 --> 05:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
under their telepaths
 
05:24:27.280 --> 05:24:28.628 align:start position:0%
under their telepaths
license

05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
they would not need to also get a new
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire license so
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
they someone in louisiana as we talked
 
05:24:34.958 --> 05:24:35.750 align:start position:0%
they someone in louisiana as we talked
about

05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
for another
 
05:24:36.798 --> 05:24:38.230 align:start position:0%
for another
bill

05:24:38.230 --> 05:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:24:39.510 --> 05:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
rather than getting a new hampshire
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
license to be able to serve remotely
 
05:24:44.550 --> 05:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
through telehealth someone here in new
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire they could get a telehealth
 
05:24:46.958 --> 05:24:49.190 align:start position:0%
hampshire they could get a telehealth
license

05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:24:50.230 --> 05:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.040 --> 05:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
this would address somewhat
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
similar to my concerns when we did talk
 
05:24:59.840 --> 05:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
similar to my concerns when we did talk
about

05:25:01.430 --> 05:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
compacts and having compacts and people
 
05:25:04.550 --> 05:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
we have additional licensees working in
 
05:25:08.550 --> 05:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
state not paying license fees here in
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for the services they're
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
providing but paying to a home state
 
05:25:12.878 --> 05:25:14.310 align:start position:0%
providing but paying to a home state
this

05:25:14.310 --> 05:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
would somewhat alleviate my concerns by
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
charging those that are licensed out of
 
05:25:19.600 --> 05:25:21.030 align:start position:0%
charging those that are licensed out of
state

05:25:21.030 --> 05:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
paying somewhat to a board
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
a fee to practice you
 
05:25:28.390 --> 05:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
i mean my understanding yes
 
05:25:31.590 --> 05:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
they under this telehealth
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
program they would be paying a fee to
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire it would be
 
05:25:37.590 --> 05:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
less than we'd be charging our our full
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
applicants i think um
 
05:25:42.150 --> 05:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
dr warner had testified to that so if we
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
made each other we right now by statute
 
05:25:45.990 --> 05:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
we are charging for a new hampshire
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
license 300
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
um i think she had thought this would be
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
more along the lines of 90 so we'd be
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
charging less to someone
 
05:25:57.270 --> 05:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
coming into our state remotely from out
 
05:25:59.190 --> 05:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
of state
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
to recommend it to the full committee
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
and otpa because there may be an
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
amendment coming
 
05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair i see miss courtney raising our
 
05:26:25.040 --> 05:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
mr chair i see miss courtney raising our
hands

05:26:28.550 --> 05:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record lindsey
 
05:26:31.590 --> 05:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
courtney executive director office of
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
professional licensure um
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to express
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
that i have some concerns regarding this
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill i do not believe it's necessary
 
05:26:41.520 --> 05:26:42.550 align:start position:0%
bill i do not believe it's necessary
i

05:26:42.550 --> 05:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the objective which is to
 
05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
make it easier for people to obtain a
 
05:26:48.550 --> 05:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
license in new hampshire
 
05:26:50.390 --> 05:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that this bill is the
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
way to approach it so presently right
 
05:26:55.990 --> 05:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
now anybody can provide tele health
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
telepsychology services with a
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
psychology license
 
05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
the issue is and i think that the board
 
05:27:05.990 --> 05:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
has recognized it is that people have
 
05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
difficulties with getting a license
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
but for my
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
my observation the reason they have
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting a license is because
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
the actual rules are onerous not the
 
05:27:19.110 --> 05:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think that the best uh way to deal
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
with this issue is to actually have the
 
05:27:24.240 --> 05:27:25.590 align:start position:0%
with this issue is to actually have the
board

05:27:25.590 --> 05:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
amend its rules to make it easier for
 
05:27:30.070 --> 05:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
people to obtain a license rather than
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
create additional licensing categories
 
05:27:34.708 --> 05:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
i do want to note that the standard of
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
care how you provide care to people has
 
05:27:39.190 --> 05:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
to be the same regardless of the
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
platform that it's delivered
 
05:27:43.190 --> 05:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make sense that somebody
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
receiving telehealth services
 
05:27:45.680 --> 05:27:46.708 align:start position:0%
receiving telehealth services
um

05:27:46.708 --> 05:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
with the same standard of care
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
would you know
 
05:27:52.708 --> 05:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
that somebody providing those services
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
would not have to jump through the same
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
hoops as somebody who provides in-person
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
visits because everything else is the
 
05:28:02.230 --> 05:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
same other than the platform um through
 
05:28:04.628 --> 05:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
which these services are delivered i
 
05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
just think that the administrative
 
05:28:08.470 --> 05:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
burdens um regarding processing
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
additional licenses from the office of
 
05:28:12.628 --> 05:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
professional licensure
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
really don't warrant the additional
 
05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
license uh as required i think the board
 
05:28:19.350 --> 05:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
just needs to do its work and and then
 
05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.548 --> 05:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so miss courtney
 
05:28:34.390 --> 05:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
do you have any question whether the
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
board has the statutory authority
 
05:28:40.070 --> 05:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
to uh to grant this
 
05:28:42.628 --> 05:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
under its current statute
 
05:28:44.310 --> 05:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
they do um
 
05:28:46.628 --> 05:28:46.638 align:start position:0%
so they do have the authority so right
 
05:28:49.270 --> 05:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
now with a psychology license you can
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
provide telehealth services to anybody
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
physically located in new hampshire
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
um with a with a regular psychology
 
05:28:58.150 --> 05:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
license you can also provide those
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
services in person
 
05:29:02.470 --> 05:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
whether you need a license um is based
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
on where the patient is physically
 
05:29:06.868 --> 05:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
located so so the a person with a
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
regular psychology license can certainly
 
05:29:11.430 --> 05:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
provide telehealth services and i will
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
note uh for interest that 67 percent of
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with an active license in
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire providing psychology
 
05:29:23.110 --> 05:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
services have an emergency license
 
05:29:25.030 --> 05:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's pretty telling
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
about how easy it is to obtain an
 
05:29:29.830 --> 05:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
existing psychology license but i don't
 
05:29:31.270 --> 05:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
think the answer is to create a new
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
licensing category i think it's to
 
05:29:34.948 --> 05:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
modify our existing our existing
 
05:29:36.628 --> 05:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
structures to align with what the board
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
thinks is appropriate for telehealth
 
05:29:42.628 --> 05:29:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up follow-up
 
05:29:45.910 --> 05:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
um okay so uh
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that i that i was
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
discussing recently was you know uh with
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
regard to when telehealth or
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
is is uh involved uh where is the
 
05:30:00.390 --> 05:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
service service being provided i mean
 
05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the provider is someplace
 
05:30:04.390 --> 05:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
if the
 
05:30:06.868 --> 05:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
if the patient call them the patient is
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
05:30:08.240 --> 05:30:09.510 align:start position:0%
someplace else
um

05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:11.830 --> 05:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
has it been adjudicated it seems to me
 
05:30:14.070 --> 05:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
like the service is being provided where
 
05:30:16.150 --> 05:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
the patient is
 
05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of where the
 
05:30:20.708 --> 05:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
the doctor is the patient getting the
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
service that's where it's being provided
 
05:30:25.590 --> 05:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
but has that been adjudicated
 
05:30:27.430 --> 05:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge
 
05:30:29.430 --> 05:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
not in new hampshire that i'm aware of
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
so but generally speaking most states
 
05:30:33.670 --> 05:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
have taken that position other courts
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
have taken that position um the state of
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i would assume has taken
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
that position by virtue of the fact that
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
when the state of um emergency was
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
enacted and everybody had to go to a
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
telehealth platform those people who
 
05:30:49.270 --> 05:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
those providers that were located
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
outside of state suddenly needed a new
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire license to continue to treat
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
their patients that's the general rule
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
with telemedicine
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
is that the practice is deemed to occur
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
where the patient is physically located
 
05:31:03.350 --> 05:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
right that that certainly would be my
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
logical assumption
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
but but
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
the the question is not whether you and
 
05:31:10.230 --> 05:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
i agree about that the question is
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
whether the courts uh and and so
 
05:31:15.510 --> 05:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
to the degree that you uh think it's
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
been done some places just not
 
05:31:19.590 --> 05:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily here
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's the answer
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:31:25.350 --> 05:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this is germane to this
 
05:31:33.670 --> 05:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
or not but i've noticed there's a lot of
 
05:31:35.190 --> 05:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
apps popping up
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
where you can get psychological services
 
05:31:39.910 --> 05:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
online through an app
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
through some type of video conference
 
05:31:44.070 --> 05:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
thing with um psychologists from all
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
over the country how does new hampshire
 
05:31:47.830 --> 05:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
so if if um
 
05:31:51.830 --> 05:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
we would handle it the same way we
 
05:31:54.070 --> 05:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
handle any sort of practice if if
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're providing services
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
and there are patients located in new
 
05:31:59.670 --> 05:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire physically located in new
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire they would have to have a
 
05:32:00.718 --> 05:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire they would have to have a
license

05:32:01.830 --> 05:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:32:04.390 --> 05:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
if um they don't have a license
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
um then our most of our regulatory
 
05:32:08.390 --> 05:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
boards including the board of psychology
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
do not have jurisdiction over that
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
matter if we were to get wind of it
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
however we would refer that over to the
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh consumer protection bureau of the
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
department of justice so that they could
 
05:32:19.830 --> 05:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
take appropriate action
 
05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:26.948 --> 05:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
back to the motion i would like to
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:35.430 --> 05:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
with potential amendments coming in the
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
i i can't hear you
 
05:32:41.670 --> 05:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative roy
 
05:32:52.958 --> 05:32:54.070 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative roy
um

05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:55.990 --> 05:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
i i think this
 
05:32:58.830 --> 05:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill it actually helped
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
consumers and we're talking about the
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
expediency when they need the services
 
05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
if they travel between states come and
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
go out
 
05:33:10.470 --> 05:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
this will help them in an expedient
 
05:33:10.480 --> 05:33:13.110 align:start position:0%
this will help them in an expedient
manner

05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
because they can still reach their
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
doctor when they're visiting when
 
05:33:17.830 --> 05:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're on vacation or they're going
 
05:33:17.840 --> 05:33:19.910 align:start position:0%
they're on vacation or they're going
elsewhere

05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm making the motion
 
05:33:24.390 --> 05:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
i i would check out what you say
 
05:33:26.638 --> 05:33:37.750 align:start position:0%
i i would check out what you say
and

05:33:37.750 --> 05:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm going to uh
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
voting against that motion um
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
i think we heard in testimony that uh
 
05:33:48.628 --> 05:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
telemedicine can already take place
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
without this
 
05:33:50.000 --> 05:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
without this
um

05:33:51.190 --> 05:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:53.190 --> 05:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is just new hampshire that's going
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
to be collecting its own fee i think
 
05:33:57.910 --> 05:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
this bill this section of the bill uh
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
the language in here needs more work um
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
i would rather see it removed
 
05:34:06.788 --> 05:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
um from the omnibus bill and uh brought
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
back is another piece of legislation
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
um next year that could be really worked
 
05:34:13.590 --> 05:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
on by the committee to get a good
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
product i don't think it's ready for
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
prime time and i don't think we should
 
05:34:19.030 --> 05:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
be passing something that isn't ready
 
05:34:20.788 --> 05:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
for prime time quite yet and needs a
 
05:34:23.110 --> 05:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of work so i'll vote against
 
05:34:25.270 --> 05:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
it and hope that um i don't see a dire
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
need for it to come out um right now um
 
05:34:29.750 --> 05:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think we could do some work on it if
 
05:34:32.230 --> 05:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
it came back next year so i'll be voting
 
05:34:33.670 --> 05:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
against motion
 
05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:42.638 --> 05:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:34:45.910 --> 05:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
overall so
 
05:34:49.670 --> 05:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
the motion is otp
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
one part 12 representative roy
 
05:34:53.040 --> 05:34:56.150 align:start position:0%
one part 12 representative roy
yes

05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:56.160 --> 05:34:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:35:03.190 --> 05:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.920 --> 05:35:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:35:15.670 --> 05:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:35:17.830 --> 05:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
that would be passing
 
05:35:17.840 --> 05:35:24.788 align:start position:0%
that would be passing
3-2

05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
05:35:27.990 --> 05:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
did you
 
05:35:30.070 --> 05:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
i just i waited till you're done with
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
the voting yeah
 
05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so i just want to suggest that if
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
representative goldie uh
 
05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
wants something better brought back next
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
thing obviously uh would depend on
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
whether this passes or not but to the
 
05:35:49.590 --> 05:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
degree that we voted to retain
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
the bill uh
 
05:35:53.590 --> 05:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
then we wouldn't have to fight the thing
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
that the possibility that
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill in the second term
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
would be blocked by the fact that we
 
05:36:03.990 --> 05:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
voted at itl
 
05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
this time around
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
so i just want to suggest that to him
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
05:36:10.390 --> 05:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
the motion we would want if that's where
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
the way
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
the way the committee wants to go
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
is that we would retain it and let it
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
and work on it and so forth
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
just a thought
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we've got we've still got time
 
05:36:23.670 --> 05:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
until the full community i know i i just
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to run that past the subcommittee
 
05:36:25.760 --> 05:36:26.628 align:start position:0%
wanted to run that past the subcommittee
because

05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
obviously there's some
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh some issue here
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
that we we may want to further consider
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
mr chair if we if i might
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think there is the ability to
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
retain certain sections of this it's
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
either amended
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
one way up or down and that's the only
 
05:36:48.310 --> 05:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
way we can do it is to pull out sections
 
05:36:50.548 --> 05:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
put sections in we can't retain certain
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
sections it's a bill as a whole it's an
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill
 
05:36:55.750 --> 05:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
05:36:55.760 --> 05:36:56.868 align:start position:0%
yes okay
yeah

05:36:56.868 --> 05:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:36:56.878 --> 05:36:58.948 align:start position:0%
yeah
yep

05:36:58.948 --> 05:36:58.958 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
right quite well taken
 
05:37:06.310 --> 05:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chair i was going to
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
agree entirely with representative
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
goalie it's in or out
 
05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
we can't retain a portion of a bill
 
05:37:16.400 --> 05:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
we can't retain a portion of a bill
but

05:37:17.360 --> 05:37:17.370 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:37:17.370 --> 05:37:18.548 align:start position:0%
but
[Music]

05:37:18.548 --> 05:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:37:21.670 --> 05:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
and in fact having it removed from from
 
05:37:24.070 --> 05:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
an omnibus would not invalidate it for
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
coming in next year as a separate bill
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
in any event
 
05:37:31.110 --> 05:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's true for all of the sections
 
05:37:31.120 --> 05:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
that's true for all of the sections
right

05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for pointing that out joe
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
um i think we're done with this session
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.868 --> 05:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
