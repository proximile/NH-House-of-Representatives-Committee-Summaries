00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
months ago on December 7th
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
2019 Adam Montgomery beat his little
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
5-year-old daughter
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
Harmony but this time he beat the little
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
girl for the last time and ended up
 
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
girl for the last time and ended up
killing

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
killing
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
her then because the ground was
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
frozen he moved her body around a very
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
locations he ke he kept her little body
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
in an air shaft he put it in a cooler
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
kept in a hallway and then lastly he
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
kept it for the last month in a
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
commercial freezer when the ground had
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
th thought he
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
finally disposed of her
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
body what I didn't
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
know is under the state
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
law when a person is charged with with a
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
felony they do not have to appear at
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
trial they don't have to appear at
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
right when I think of the
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
fact that the
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is filing a motion after Adam
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
McGary was found guilty last month to
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
ask the court to compel him to be
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
present for his May 9th
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
sentencing I said this isn't
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
right and I could think about this
 
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.669 align:start position:0%
right and I could think about this
horrendous

00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
horrendous
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
crime but I think about someone who was
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
a victim of fonia sexual
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
assault and we have a very strong victim
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights in this state where
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
people have the right to either in
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
writer in writing or orally present to
 
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.470 align:start position:0%
writer in writing or orally present to
the

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
court their victim statement
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't think of anything worse
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
for someone who has been a victim of a
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
crime to be presenting that statement to
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
the court and look at the defense table
 
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
and see an empty chair where the
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
perpetrator of that crime should be
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
sitting Mr Speaker what I would like to
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
bring in for a
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill and I would use the federal rules
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
of criminal procedure rule
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
43 which is the Federal rule that
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
requires all people charged with a
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
felony in federal court regardless of
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
the seriousness of the offense to be
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
there at their arraignment jury
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
selection trial and
 
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
sentencing what I would propose is not
 
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.870 align:start position:0%
sentencing what I would propose is not
as

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
stringent I would propose in a bill that
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
anyone charged in the granted state with
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
a class a felony and in New Hampshire we
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
have two classes of felony Class B where
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
you can get a year and a half to three
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
years incarceration or a Class A which
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
carries a penalty of 7 and a half to 15
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
years unless it's a capital offense and
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
then you're facing possible life class A
 
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.029 align:start position:0%
then you're facing possible life class A
felonies

00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
cover primarily our crimes of violence
 
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.909 align:start position:0%
cover primarily our crimes of violence
from

00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:22.110 align:start position:0%
from
murder

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
murder
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
rape burglary arm
 
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
rape burglary arm
robbery

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:29.149 align:start position:0%

Asen

00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
Asen
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
fonal sexual assault and the list goes
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
on my proposed
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
bill would require that person to be in
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
court during the judicial process it
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
would allow for either the defense of
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
the prosecution to file a motion with
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
the court on based on Just Cause for the
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
defendant to be absent or on motion of
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
the trial judge
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
themselves again I don't believe that it
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
should should be put off to next
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
year as I said the prosecutors filed a
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
motion with a court compelling Adam
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
Montgomery to be in court to face how
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
many's other family members and people
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
that that loved
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
her I don't know how the court is going
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
to rule but I ask you to grant me the
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
permission and to bring bring in a late
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
late bill so that it can file this bill
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
so that anybody charged with a class a
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
felony like Adam mcgomery will be in
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%

history in this country about parents
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
rights let's start with the US Supreme

Court cases that date back almost 100
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%

child is not a mere creature of the

1982
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
1993 mention this one the 14th Amendment
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
forbids the government to infringe on
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
the fundamental Liberty interests of all
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
no matter who what no matter what
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
process is provided unless the
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
infrigment is narrowly tailored to serve
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
a compelling government interest we'll
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
touch on that
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
again Washington V versus gillburg
 
00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%
1997 Troxel versus Granville 2 th000 and
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
there are more I won't go into all of
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
them but the rulings have been
 
00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039 align:start position:0%
consistent that the due process clause
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
of the 14th of Amendment of the United
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
States Constitution protects the
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental right of parents to direct
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
the care upbringing and education of
 
00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:45.830 align:start position:0%
the care upbringing and education of
their

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
children cac1 17 adds an amendment to
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
our Constitution's Bill of Rights right
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
under the right of privacy that we
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
passed and the public voted for in 201
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
18 this amendment does three simple
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
things three simple
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
sentences first sentence parents have a
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
fundamental right and responsibility to
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
direct the upbringing Education and Care
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
children and the argument against that
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
is what the Supreme Court has ruled and
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
said that very same thing for
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
years the second sentence
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
neither the state nor any political
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall infringe on the these
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
rights without demonstrating that its
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest as
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
applied to the person is the highest
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
order and not otherwise served this
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
parallels a Supreme Court case of Reno
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
versus Flores which upheld the 14th
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment and said the same thing about
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
compelling government
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
ises third sentence the this article
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
shall not be construed to apply to a
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
parental action or decision that would
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
end the life or otherwise physically
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
harm a
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
child so it's not con con um giving
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights to parents to harm their
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
children specifically we are putting
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
amendment so why is this amendment
 
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
needed exhibit a the majority report is
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
exhibit a why this is
 
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
needed the majority report says that
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
this may enable parents to do things
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
like forcing children to quit school to
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
go to work or neglecting the proper
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
health care of their
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
children in effect it may enable parents
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
to be bad
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
parents evidently they did not read
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
sentences two and three of the
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that says specifically that
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
that parents are not allowed to cause
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
harm based on this Constitutional
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment they are also ignoring the
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
laws of New Hampshire that protect
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
children and there is sanowski versus
 
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
Kramer in
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
1982 uh Supreme Court case about the
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
minimal interests of the child which
 
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
read additional T attacks on parents
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
have been heard in this chamber and in
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
our committee education committee
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
repeatedly a few years ago here in this
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
very chamber there was a a bill related
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%

parents' rights who homeschool it was
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
said in this chamber that homeschool
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
parents sometimes want to homeschool
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
their children because they abuse their
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
children and this would hide the
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
abuse this week we had 4 to 500 parents
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
come to the education committee to talk
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%

rights this is
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
repeated this is why we need this
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%

constitution please vote red to overturn
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
this itl motion because parents around
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
the state are watching and they want to
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
be able to vote vote on this and they
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%

you Representative Patrick no is
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%

report thank you Mr
Speaker

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues the majority of the committee
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this legislation not
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
because we are opposed to parental
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
rights because after all we're parents
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
and grandparents as well and we cherish
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
our rights no less than others but
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
because we know that parental rights
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
already exist they are well established
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
in federal and state statutes they have
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
been affirmed time and time again in
 
00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
been affirmed time and time again in
court

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
rulings and that this will not give
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
parents anything more than what they
 
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.269 align:start position:0%
parents anything more than what they
already

00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
have it has been repeated repeatedly
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
asked in committee hearings and
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
personally to individual members do
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights already exist and the
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
answer is always yes likewise will this
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
legislation give parents anything more
 
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
than what they already have and the
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
answer is
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
no we are doing our constituents a huge
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
disservice when we put forth legislation
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
which leads them to believe that they do
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
not have parental rights or that we're
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
going to bestow upon them rights which
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
they don't know they already have you
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
see it seems to me that the real issue
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
is that some parents believe that their
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
rights are being violated and that they
 
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.030 align:start position:0%
rights are being violated and that they
want

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
recourse the question then
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
is how do we address violations of
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
parental rights and we don't solve that
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
problem by simply restating the obvious
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
which is what this legislation does
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
instead we best serve our constituents
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
by being honest with them and directing
 
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.030 align:start position:0%
by being honest with them and directing
them

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
accordingly additionally while good
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
parents the vast majority are already
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
protected under existing laws and court
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
rulings the committee does fear that
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
some the few may feel falsely emboldened
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
to act in ways which are not in the best
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
interest of their children and puts them
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
In Harm's Way colleagues I ask that you
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
vote with the bipartisan committee
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%

00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
Speaker the questions on the motion have
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
been expedient to legislate on cicc1 17
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
that most parents are good parents and
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
that the ones they are the ones who
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
should have the primary role in their
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
children's upbringing and if I know that
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment would not interfere in

parents are not good parents and finally

if I know that this amendment would
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
balance the scales between the rights
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%

the rights and responsibilities of the

it's easy to make the argument that we
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
need to put all of those additional
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
constraints that's in the current bill
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
into our
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%

other
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%

with the exceptions of a bunch of
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
different things it says
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
says our fundamental rights for firearms
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%

00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
amendment clearly states that if a

parent has done something so egregious
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
that they need to have their parent
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
their parental rights terminated that
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
still can happen in
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
statute we don't need to put that extra
 
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
Clause into the Constitution that will
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%

Speaker unfortunately Society is filled
 
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.309 align:start position:0%
Speaker unfortunately Society is filled
with

00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
parents who don't take the financial
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility of their
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
children but there are more parents who
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
do take the financial responsibility of
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
those children
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
seriously House Bill 1189 was introduced
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
to the children and family law committee
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
for the simple
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
reason that a state agency isn't doing
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
the job they are tasked to do
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
properly we have many many
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
parents in this state who are working
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
hard and
 
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily have their wages garnished
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that their children are
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony the New Hampshire Bureau
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
of Child Support Services
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
stated that it is tasked to accurately
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
report all aages in child support over I
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
repeat over
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
$2500 to the federal government and that
 
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.589 align:start position:0%
$2500 to the federal government and that
they

00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
do what they don't do is report the fact
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
that someone has paid those aages and is
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
no longer in
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
aers or the aage is well under the $2500
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
$5 such was the case of the sponsor of
 
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.390 align:start position:0%
$5 such was the case of the sponsor of
this

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
bill the committee heard testimony from
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bureau of Child
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
Support Services concerning their
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
reporting process but when asked how
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
many people this action affect Ed the
 
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.230 align:start position:0%
many people this action affect Ed the
answer

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.870 align:start position:0%
answer
was

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
ready we don't currently have that
 
00:49:35.559 --> 00:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
ready we don't currently have that
information

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
H when asked if they could get that
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
information the answer
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
was I'm not really
 
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.030 align:start position:0%
was I'm not really
sure

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
H so this testimony led to some
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee members believing that this
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
bill was brought before us because one
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
one yes one person's
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
issue therefore they felt the need to it
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
this bill stating that they were not
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
going to legislate for just one
 
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.150 align:start position:0%
going to legislate for just one
person

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
okay I and other members of the
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
committee found it very hard to believe
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
one so one Committee Member came to me
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
and said can we file a
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
91a we talked about it for a while and
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
then thought we have an very able
 
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.549 align:start position:0%
then thought we have an very able
committee

00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
researcher why don't we ask her to do
 
00:50:39.799 --> 00:50:40.710 align:start position:0%
researcher why don't we ask her to do
the

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
research and our committee researcher as
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
able as she is did so the following
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
information that I'm going to read to
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
you was not available to our committee
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
at the time that we exec this bill it's
 
00:50:55.599 --> 00:50:57.910 align:start position:0%
at the time that we exec this bill it's
a

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
memorandum the subject was individuals
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
reported for child support of rear in
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
the last 24
 
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.870 align:start position:0%
the last 24
months

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
question how many individuals in the
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
last 24 months have been reported to the
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
feds because they
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
meet met or exceeded $2500 in child
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
supportive re
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.470 align:start position:0%
 
12,087

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
12,087
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
one the second question was how many
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
individuals continue to be reported to
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
the FED after falling
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
below the $2500 in a rear
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
threshold but not at zero
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
OED so so to determine this number they
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
compared the total of number of
 
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.670 align:start position:0%
compared the total of number of
individuals

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
12,087 to the federal collections data
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
file on
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
13124 the total number of individuals
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
who continued to be reported and whose
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
$2500 which meant that they owed
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.549 align:start position:0%

00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
1,037
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
people H that's not one person either is
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
it I do understand that the committee
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
did not have this information at the
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
bill so I think you can agree that these
 
00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
numbers are staggering shocking and
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
personally I find it appalling that
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
these many people have been denied
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
passports listed as deadbeat parents
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
when they're really
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
not because what happens
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
is if you get paid every two weeks or
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
once a month inevitably you will be
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
behind at some point during the year
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
because of how many weeks there are per
 
00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:27.069 align:start position:0%
because of how many weeks there are per
month

00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's not your fault you have
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
voluntarily had your wages
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
garnished the state is collecting that
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
money for every pay
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
period you're not voluntarily refusing
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
to pay child
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
support So ladies and gentlemen I ask
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
you to vote no on the itel motion so
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%

representative that tried to leave the

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker members if
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
I know that uh there was an a will by
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee to recommit
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
this to committee but that the time
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
frame that we're allowed Now does not
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
allow so because of the need to move
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
things to the other body and if I
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
further know that if we pass this today
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
and overturn the itl that the other body
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
will be able to fully vet this in a
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing with the new information
 
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
that was brought with well over a
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
thousand people who have been denied
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
passports when they never exceeded that
 
00:58:51.079 --> 00:58:53.150 align:start position:0%
passports when they never exceeded that
$2500

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
$2500
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
threshold because they're pay periods
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
lined up improperly with the weekly pay
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's required by the department and if
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
I further know that much of the
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
misinformation you heard in the
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from the itl side of things is
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
simply that misinformation and doesn't
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
take the facts of the cases into play
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
would I now push the red button to
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl so that an appropriate
 
00:59:23.029 --> 00:59:23.039 align:start position:0%
motion could be made and this could be
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
heard in the other body thank thank you

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know New
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's automated Reporting System
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
reports a reage at 25 2500 and above and
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
if I know that reporting is done once
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
and it is up to the uh person in a reage
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
to straighten that out with them so they
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be continually reported and and
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
if I further know that house bill 1189
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
would require additional expense in
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%

only would recording be from the table
 
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
where each party sits would the court
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
deem that disruptive it was stated in
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that someone else could re
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
record for a party this bill has no
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%

need to move from their front table and

addressing their devices if the judge
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
allowed it to be in the back of the
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
court is that disruptive private
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
Communications are not to be
 
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
recorded who would verify that the front
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the judge judges benches today audio
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
capabilities easily pick up the audio
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
also audio on private conversations with
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
opposing party can and would be also
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
picked up finally change of custody for
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%

review their own video and audio uh and
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
helping them with their case however if
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
needed to be entered in the record as we
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony how would the chain
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
of custody be determined currently with
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
the Court's permission of recording can
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
be done by anyone a party in a
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
proceeding can invite someone they know
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
to record allow to to record allowing
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
for concentration on their procceedings
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
with the court approval the minority
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
believes House Bill 1266 would create
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
addition conflict between the parties
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
and the court and uh Mr Speaker I
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%

concerns about privacy sometimes the
 
01:05:02.279 --> 01:05:03.789 align:start position:0%

such as this having a recording
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
especially to those who do not have an
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
attorney and need to play back the
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%

permitted in court with prior permission
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
therefore this legislation is
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary if I also know that this
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
raises privacy issues for
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
children if I know that this bill would
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
raise concerns about how the Supreme
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
Court will decide which recording to
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
rely upon in appealed
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
cases and finally if I know that New
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance the New
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%

Waypoint all gave us testimony against
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
this please vote no on hb1 1266 so that
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%

01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker thank you very much
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity if I know that the previous
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
speaker is correct with prior
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
request you
 
01:09:04.759 --> 01:09:06.349 align:start position:0%
request you
can

01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
um absolutely record the
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
proceedings but if I know that in some
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
cases people
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the time nor are they aware
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
that they can make that previous
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
request and if I know that
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
it is humanly impossible to remember
 
01:09:33.309 --> 01:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
everything that is said in a courtroom
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
especially if you're nervous or
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
upset and if I finally know that it is
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
very important for all people to have
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
access to what is said about them and to
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
them in a court of
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
law then I would ask you to press the GR
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
green button and passed this very
 
01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.510 align:start position:0%
green button and passed this very
important

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
legislation the questions on the motion
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass on House Bill 1266 and
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%

motion thank you Mr
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker the purpose of HB
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
1308 is to allow parents to know what
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
library books their children have
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
checked out at both public and school
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
libraries currently Library circulation
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
records are considered confidential for
 
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
all users including miners the problem
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
with this law is reflected in a common
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
situation at library circulation desks
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
in which a parent pays an overdue fine
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
on a child child's account but the
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
library staff member cannot tell the
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
parent what book the fine is for aside
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
from practical problems with this law
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
there is a more fundamental issue that
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
reveals its
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistency the American Library
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
Association asserts on its website that
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
quote the parents role is to monitor his
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
or her child's individual reading life
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
end quote to fulfill their parental role
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
more effectively parents need to know
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
what books their children have checked
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
out this is especially important in
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
school libraries where parents are not
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
usually present with their children as
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
they often are in public libraries while
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
some children may not want their parents
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
to know what they are reading their
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
privacy rights should not extend to
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
their use of materials that they have
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
not financially contributed to parents
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
should be able to access their child's
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
Library records because as adults they
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
are the taxpayers who fund their school
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
in public libraries meanwhile this bill
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
does nothing to a child's right to
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
privately read whatever they want inside
 
01:13:30.679 --> 01:13:31.510 align:start position:0%
privately read whatever they want inside
the

01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
Library HB 1308 has been criticized as
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
an unfunded
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
mandate this bill does require a library
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
to share all Library records regarding a
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
child's use of material if a library
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
however doesn't keep comprehensive
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
records of every book ever checked out
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
by P patrons all Library records would
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
just refer to the current books that are
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
checked out by the child this bill would
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
not require them to change this policy
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
there is no cost incurred to Simply show
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
apparent these existing
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
records regarding this issue I do have a
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
simple clarifying language to propose if
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
this itl is overturned and I am able to
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
offer a floor Amendment another
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
objection to this bill in committee was
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
that it would put a child in danger of
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
Parental abuse in order to implement
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
this law in the best interest of the
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
child's safety a library could mitigate
 
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
such a threat by having a policy of
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
asking for the parents driver's license
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
and making sure the address matches that
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
on a child's account it should also be
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
emphasized however that Library staff
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
are not the police it should be on the
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
onus the onus of the custodial parent to
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
bring any concerns about a potentially
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
Abus abusive parent to the attention of
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
Library staff just as they would inform
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
schools and teachers of such a situation
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
again the floor amendment I will offer
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
if the itl is overturned addresses this
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
issue and also remember that this
 
01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
language could be further clarified on
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
the other side of the
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
wall in conclusion to improve Library
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
service and support parental involvement
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
in their children's reading Pursuits
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the itl motion so that
 
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made thank you Mr
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker and I request a division
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
vote representative Raymond's recognized
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker a bipartisan
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee felt that this
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
bill was not practical and recommended
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate here are a few
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
reasons why currently most libraries in
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and most libraries in the
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
United States do not not keep lists of
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
the books patrons have checked out for
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
longer than 30 to 90 days these records
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
are used only for the purposes of
 
01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
assigning late finds and are typically
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
purged once the book is returned
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
libraries do have a catalog of materials
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
for the collection maintenance but it
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't include identifying information
 
01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
of readers for any particular book so if
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
you or I wanted to get a list of all the
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
books that we personally checked out
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
last year we would find that it doesn't
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
exist there are currently no libraries
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that create or maintain
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
records of visitors internet history nor
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
visitors of of records of visitors
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
participation in activities and events
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
happening at the library this bill would
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
require libraries to create a recording
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
system for the activities and
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
information to that type of activity and
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
information in order to do that our
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
libraries will have to invest in new
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
databases and hire additional staff at
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
an unknown cost to local property
 
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.030 align:start position:0%
an unknown cost to local property
taxpayers

01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that libraries
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't collect this data because of the
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
first and Fourth Amendment the Privacy
 
01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
Act of 1974 and the 1998 children's
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
online privacy protection act there are
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
several US Supreme Court cases that
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
affirm the right to privacy when
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
accessing public
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
libraries the other concern of the
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee was that this bill can be
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous to abused and neglected
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
children and victims of domestic
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
violence it's common for the family
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
court to issue protective orders and
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions on access to records as
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
part of a custody agreement in cases
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
where there has been abuse neglect or
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
domestic violence by requiring libraries
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
to give information to any parent
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
without knowledge of custody orders it
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
creates a Gateway for abusive people to

access information that the court has
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
determined they are not legally entitled
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
to libraries are public facilities they
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
should not be put in the middle of
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
custody and parenting plans lastly it's
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that libraries
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
are public buildings not babysitting
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
Services one of the most fundamental
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of parenting is to
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
meaningfully connect with one's children
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
and guide them to developmentally
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate activities media and reading
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
choices that align with their own family
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
values parents who feel genuine
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about their children being
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
exposed to developmentally inappropriate
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
materials should be providing parenting
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
supervision while in the the library
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
parents who are concerned that their
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
older children are not responsible
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
enough to choose materials that align
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
with their family values already have
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
the option of simply not giving their
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
child their own library card and instead
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
have them use the parents library card
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
something to which the parent has
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
unfettered access for all of these
 
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to concur with the
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
bipartisan super majority of the
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee and press green to keep the
 
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:54.760 align:start position:0%

1308 representative Granger requests a

01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members

inexpedient to legislate on House Bill
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
1308 and this is a roll call vote
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
representative Drago recognized for a
 
01:20:19.639 --> 01:20:21.750 align:start position:0%

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
libraries already keep track of who
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
takes out a book and by adding one more
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
person on the record to know who can
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
take out a book does not create an
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate and if I know children
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
at the age of six and in some cases five
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
are allowed to have a library card and
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
from that moment on parents do not have
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
access to what their child reads in
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:53.229 align:start position:0%
access to what their child reads in

record
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
and if I know a parent is
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for their child's overdue or
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
lost book finds but they can't be
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
told what book they are actually paying
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
for and if I know that at the moment and
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
in in an individual makes a life choice
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
to start a family it's their right and
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
their right alone to raise a child how
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
they see fit and it's not a government
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
organization that can tell them
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
then you will join me in pressing the
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
red button so another motion and an
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
amendment can be
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
introduced representative Gregs
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill lacks the
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of our libraries current
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
abilities and funding for recordkeeping
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the cost of making
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
the necessary adjustments would be a
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
great cost to
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and if I know that it should
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
not be put on the Librarians to police
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
records access for complex family
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
Dynamics and if I further know that
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
parents are able to and strongly
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
encouraged by our libraries to accompany
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
their minor children in using the
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
resources therefore being able to help
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
guide and observe their own children's
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
choices would I not support the
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%

children and family law which was

referred House Bill 1392 an act relative
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
to consideration of the opinion of the

child in determining parenting time
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%

same with the following resolution

minority of the committee having

considered the same and being unable to
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with the
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
pass representative Candace Gibbons for
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
the minority of the
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative Gibbons is
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak against the
 
01:24:23.679 --> 01:24:28.910 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak against the
committee

01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker uh this bill
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh I came up with over the summer
 
01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
because I was going on a on a rabbit
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
hole down the internet and I was doing
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
some research so it's true that we do
 
01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:49.639 align:start position:0%
already have in statute that the child
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
can testify as far as uh what what they
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
what their opinion is regarding
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
parenting time but we don't actually see
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
that in practice so I started going down
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
this Rabbit Hole to see why are we not
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
seeing this in practice um and I was
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
looking at Pub Med I was looking at law
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
journals and what I found out was that
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
it is considered traumatic for a child
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
to be brought into court stressful for
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
them and so that's when I started um
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
doing the research to come up with this
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
bill so if it's considered traumatic to
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
bring a child in to
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
testify and then the judge determines
 
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
that the child is not mature enough to
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
give their opinion then basically the
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
child was brought in created some trauma
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then and never had the opportunity
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
to give their testimony so I was like
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
well I I understand that that makes
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
sense to me so how can we fix this
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
so usually what they do is in situations
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
where the child's testimony wants to be
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
brought into the courtroom usually they
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
use uh you know someone like a guardian
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
at lium well the problem is that those
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
are not funded by the state and that's a
 
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
separate issue and if I'm reelected then
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
I can put in a bill that we can get
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
funding for Guardians at lium through
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
the state so basically what we end up
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
with is people who can afford a guardian
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
at lium have a guardian at lium who can
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of their child people
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
who do not have a guardian at lium or
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
cannot afford one their child doesn't
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
get to speak so again you know I'm not
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
really just looking for problems I'm
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
looking for Solutions so how can we fix
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
this well if the child has a
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
therapist then we the therapist can just
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
write a little blurb about is the child
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
able to testify is the child mature
 
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
enough to testify if they do that then
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have to bring in the child for
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
the judge to do the assessment
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
piece we will bring in the report from
 
01:27:24.109 --> 01:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
the uh from from the therapist telling
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
the judge that yes the child has the
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
maturity to be able to give their
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
opinion in court and as a side note I am
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
a fan of equal parenting time so this is
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
more this isn't so much for the child to
 
01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
say like what parent they want to live
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
with it's not about that it's about you
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
know Billy
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
has uh you know Fridays that he wants to
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
go to uh Ste Steve's house that lives
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
near Dad and so he wants to spend
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
Fridays with his dad um but he'll still
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
want you know equal parenting time with
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
his mom so he might want other days with
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
his mom but that you know it's the
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
child's life so I think that the child
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
should be able to give their opinion
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
about how they want the 50/50 parenting
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
to look because there's so many
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
permutations on how 50-50 parenting time
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
can be exactly
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
crafted so if we were
 
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
to um have the child assessed by a
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
therapist uh to say that they're mature
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
enough to testify in court then we take
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
that assessment piece off of the judge
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
the judge can affirm the child is uh
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
mature enough to testify they don't have
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
to create any trauma on behalf of you
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
know of traumatizing the child by by
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
bringing them in when when they
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any gain you're only bringing
 
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
the child in if you
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
can get their opinion I hope that makes
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
sense um I would ask for you to vote red
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
against the
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
itl and I did present an amendment which
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
we can do next um to fix some of the
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
language thank you Mr
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker represent of Longs recognized to
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I guess we
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
don't need family court it's child's
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
life let the child figure out what
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
when Hospital 1392 will require that the
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
court give consideration of a therapist
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
shall shall give consideration of
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
therapist to the child's report as to
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
the child sufficient maturity to to make
 
01:29:52.199 --> 01:29:53.669 align:start position:0%
the child sufficient maturity to to make
sound

01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
sound
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
judgment what's that relationship with
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
the child and the therapist is a report
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
from a single session did the did the
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
parent seek out a therapist that would
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
benefit their
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
outcome this bill doesn't qualify that
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
currently a court could determine to
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
interview the child the court May
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
interview the child this bill adds with
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
the consent of the parties that the
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
majority is of the opinion this the
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
majority is of the opinion that this
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
takes the discretion of the Court
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
Away by asking two parents that can
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
agree to agree and allowing an interview
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
with the judge simply creating more
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
conflict finally we have two adults that
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
are unable to agree on parenting time so
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
we'll ask the child to make that
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
decision I ask that you uh support I um
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
I I ask you I don't remember what this
 
01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.109 align:start position:0%

Speaker um I see this bill as a Liberty
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
Bill property wrs and all of that I'm a
 
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor I think we should make it as
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
easy as possible for people to post
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
their land no trespass and other states
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
have adopted a purple paint flare on
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
trees to mark that as such uh this bill
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
uh would inform Hunters uh every year
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
when you get your license of the rules
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
and if the purple paint was adopted that
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
would be clear to
 
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
them uh this bill would not um change
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
people using the original signs to post
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
their land to allow for CrossCountry
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
skiers or other recreational activities
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
or you know allowing people to hunt
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
whatever they wanted to do they could
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
still use the signs this bill also has a
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
phase in of one year that if it were to
 
01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.350 align:start position:0%
phase in of one year that if it were to
be

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
adopted um we would still need to use
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
the signage for the one year until we
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
inform the public of the
 
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
change I believe that this is not an
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
anti-h Hunter bill which is what some
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
people are uh saying this is this is a
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
property Rights bill and I'm just trying
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for elderly Property
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
Owners to maintain and post their land
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
by using a can of spray paint that kryon
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
already prints it's purple and uh
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
marking their trees as such if they want
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
a no trespass on their land I think that
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
the educ the public is smart enough to
 
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
figure it out once it's employed here
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
just like it is in other states and I
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
have no problem supporting this it's a
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
liberty bill please vote against itl so
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made thank
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
you representative pretend is recognized
 
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
report there are a lot of people in here
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
that hate the hypocrisy we see quite
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
frequently in arguing for or against
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
legislation in this chamber and in our
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
committees that is the reason why I'm
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
speaking to overturn the itl so the
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
majority of arguments that I've heard
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
from my
 
01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle are about Bad actors
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
that will Mark people's private property
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
those same Bad actors can easily post
 
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
signs too so do we infringe on the
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment and take law abiding
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
citizens firearms because of Bad actors
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
no the gun doesn't operate on its own
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
and neither does the paint can so if you
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
research purple paint laws you will find
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
the majority of the states that have
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
these in place lean
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
conservative a republican helped draft
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and it actually does have some
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support so I stand with
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
property owners having options this bill
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
allows Property Owners to mark their
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
property with no trespass paint or signs
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require anybody to do
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
anything it gives people options so if
 
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to uphold the constitutional
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
principles for the rights of gun owners
 
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
then property owners deserve the same
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
part one article two natural rights we
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
all have the right essential inherent
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
rights are enjoying and defending life
 
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
and Liberty acquiring and possessing and
 
01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.550 align:start position:0%
and Liberty acquiring and possessing and
protecting

01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
property so I'm going to just read one
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
quote and I'll be done this law this is
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
some from someone that's in a very
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
conservative State isn't just in place
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
to keep land owners in their cattle safe
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
it also assists assists busy farmers who
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
cannot keep an eye on their land borders
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
farmers can easily Mark trees around
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
their land in a cost effective way
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
rather than taking time and money to
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
invest in property signs that may not
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
last very long please vote red against
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
the itl for another motion to be
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
presented thank you
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Muse has recognized speak
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
report uh thank you Mr Speaker U I guess
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
you could sum up my remarks uh basically
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
by uh just saying what she said and what
 
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.350 align:start position:0%
by uh just saying what she said and what
she

01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.950 align:start position:0%
she
said

01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
um our committee has heard variations of
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
this bill for the past couple of
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
sessions uh in the online testimony
 
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
submission system we had 60 people who
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
signed in and supported this bill and 16
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
who signed in and against it and I know
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks in this room I'm not one
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
of them I represent a city but I know a
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the folks in this body represent
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
towns and so when I actually looked at
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
where the people were from who were
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
signing in in support of this bill I'm
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing towns like Manchester and
 
01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
nsha and Portsmouth what I am seeing are
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
s towns like Stoddard Benton Dalton
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
Auburn Deering Claremont Newton Webster
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
New Boston Alton I could go on this is a
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
bill that your constituents want uh
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
another thing I would just remind
 
01:40:06.669 --> 01:40:06.679 align:start position:0%
everyone of is I I know this has been
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
framed as a as a property Rights bill
 
01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
but in many ways this is also a bill
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's about privacy um we' we've
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
actually in this body we think so much
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
of the right of privacy we've actually
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
enrin it in our state
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
constitution um this is a bill that
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
simply would allow more people to
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
exercise that right in a way that works
 
01:40:34.109 --> 01:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
for them thank
 
01:40:36.669 --> 01:40:36.679 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy is recognized to
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker um I really
 
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
got tag teamed on that one um so here's
 
01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.709 align:start position:0%
got tag teamed on that one um so here's
the

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
concept everything everyone said is most
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
mostly true it it will make it easier to
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
post your
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
land um although fishing game testified
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
in front of our committee that if you
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
want your property posted they'll come
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
out and do it for
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
you why would they do such a thing so
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they can help maintain the deer
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
herd they want good relations with
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
Hunters fishing game was against this
 
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill now and all honestly I I'm the one
 
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
who actually helped write the bill a
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
year ago because I thought it was a good
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
idea when I heard it
 
01:41:23.070 --> 01:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
however like many ideas once you
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
research it more and more you learn more
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
about it so the question is it really
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
put aside the hunting and the rights and
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
the trespassing let's get down to our
 
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
fundamental what we believe as a state
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
this state in the 1600s when we founded
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
it and populated it came from England
 
01:41:46.589 --> 01:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
where if you killed a deer that was on
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
the king's land you were executed it was
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
the king's property he didn't care if
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
your children were starving if you went
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
and tried to trespass on his land and
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
collected animals to feed your family
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
you were
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
executed so our Founders said we're not
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
going to do that anymore we're going to
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
share this land so New Hampshire was
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
founded on a concept of shared land it
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you can't post your
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
property but they did make it so you had
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
to take an extra step to do so so that
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
the initial implication was baring
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
everything else you were going to share
 
01:42:21.589 --> 01:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
your lands
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
so what this bill will do it makes
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
halves and halves not if you don't own
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
land and you can't find somewhere
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
without purple paint you can't hunt so
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
most of the hunters in the state
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
actually don't own land so what you're
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
doing is you're eliminating this for
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
people who don't own property so we hear
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
this you know we're supposed to be a
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
free state but we hear a lot of people
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
saying well it's my property not in my
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
backyard I'm going to paint that you
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
stay away is that what we stand for as a
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
state because that's really what this
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%

about that when you cast this vote do
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
you want to share do you want to change
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
the culture of this state from one that
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
was founded on sharing the land to one
 
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%

purple paint in the previous years
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
because of the testimony of the owners
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
however today I like the idea that the

is
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
bad and Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire have always
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
felt that the land of New Hampshire was
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
Majestic and therefore it should be
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
shared and that if I know if a person is
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
having any difficulty posting their land
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%

01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr Speaker good morning
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues there's really three points
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
you need to understand about this bill
 
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:27.639 align:start position:0%
and I won't belabor them the first point
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
is we heard testimony in committee that
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
when this when this board of education
 
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
was established it was purposely meant
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
to put everyday regular New Hampshire
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
citizens in a regulatory and oversight
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
role of
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
Education this would put professional
 
01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:51.719 align:start position:0%
Educators for the first time on this
 
01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
Point these it's generally considered
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
unethical and bad practice not best
 
01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
practice to allow people who are
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
professionally involved in an
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
organization or or in a field to
 
01:53:11.709 --> 01:53:11.719 align:start position:0%
regulate what they are involved with we
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't put Bankers in charge of ready
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
vinkers or at least we shouldn't we
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't put healthc Care Professionals who
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
are active in the field involved with
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
regulating themselves it's not a best
 
01:53:24.069 --> 01:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
practice the third and final point I
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
will make and this I think really says
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
quite a bit if I can paraphrase the what
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
we received an executive testimony from
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
the ranking minority member of the
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee who put it very bluntly he
 
01:53:40.589 --> 01:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
said the Board of Education as it
 
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
currently exists is far right and this
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary to bring it to the
 
01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
left please oppose this vote no thank
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
you I request a roll call
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%

the historical intent and the balanced

to them without paranal

consent we can't do much about the

consent we can't do much about the
federal

02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.350 align:start position:0%
federal
law

02:13:04.350 --> 02:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
02:13:11.069 --> 02:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
report says that this would violate uh
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
information sharing in federal law but
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
it does not it clearly states that
 
02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
um is not contrary to federal law all it
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
does is let parents know when
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
confidential student information is
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
being released to a third
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
party we have great concern about
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
student privacy rights in our
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I know well about the
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
requirement to let parents know about
 
02:13:43.709 --> 02:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
furpa because I wrote the
 
02:13:47.069 --> 02:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
law this bill is very simple it just
 
02:13:49.629 --> 02:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
says that when information is released
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
parents must be notified when it is
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
released what information is being
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
released to whom it's being released and
 
02:14:01.149 --> 02:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
why the amendment just clarifies that
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just passed
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
clarifies that this not does not apply
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
to information transfers between
 
02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
districts and school
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
districts we have already had a parents
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
rights piece of legislation defeated
 
02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
today and now we're hearing that
 
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
notifying parents is just another level
 
02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:20.350 align:start position:0%
notifying parents is just another level
of

02:14:20.350 --> 02:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy really you there is no there
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
are no penalties in this bill and no
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement because federal law allows
 
02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
it but shouldn't parents know what's
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
going on and what information has been
 
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
given out to other
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%

02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
know that the privacy and security of
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
student data is highly regulated through
 
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws as well as in New
 
02:16:37.469 --> 02:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doe standards and if I know
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire school districts
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools and private schools
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
belong to the New Hampshire student data
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
privacy Consortium whose primary goal is
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
to address data privacy in schools and
 
02:16:52.589 --> 02:16:52.599 align:start position:0%
furthermore if I know that this
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is not needed as it would
 
02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
provide no additional data privacy to
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
students and would place an unnecessary
 
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
burden on School District employees
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
would I now push the red button so that
 
02:17:07.629 --> 02:17:07.639 align:start position:0%

02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%

02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
information is natural essential and
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
inherent if I know that under fura rules
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
a school can disclose confidential
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%

know that this bill does not violate
 
02:17:45.070 --> 02:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
furpa and merely requires
 
02:17:47.549 --> 02:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
notification and if I know that a parent
 
02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
parent has a right to know when their
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%

02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker the primary concerns that were
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
raised regarding this proposed
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment in our
 
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee had to do with the the claim
 
02:20:37.150 --> 02:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
that the language in the proposed
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is vague well I would submit
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker that this is the very nature
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
of fundamental rights statements of
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights are always by nature
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
vague if we had before us in this body
 
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
today the First Amendment to the United
 
02:20:54.670 --> 02:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
States Constitution or the second
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I think we would make the same
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
claim that they are vague that's why we
 
02:21:03.309 --> 02:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
spent more than 200 years legislating
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
and litigating in order to debate to
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
Define and to protect those fundamental
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
rights likewise with our own New
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution it requires that
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
we Prov provide an adequate education
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
for the children of this state we all
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
know how long it's taken us to get to
 
02:21:26.429 --> 02:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
where we are now where we still can't
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
Define what it means to require an
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
adequate education for the children of
 
02:21:34.030 --> 02:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
our state Mr Speaker I submit that not a
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
single member of this body would
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
therefore conclude that it shouldn't be
 
02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
a constitutional right simply because we
 
02:21:45.070 --> 02:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
struggle to continue to Define
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
it we weren't born
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
being able to speak and yet both the
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution and the
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
constitution of the State of New
 
02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire protect our right to free
 
02:21:59.550 --> 02:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
speech certainly none of us was born
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
with a gun in our hands and yet the
 
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment and the New Hampshire
 
02:22:08.349 --> 02:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution defend our right to bear
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
arms each and every one of us was born
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
needing to breathe clean air and to
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
drink clean water and to eat produce
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
that comes from clean land there simply
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
is no right more fundamental than the
 
02:22:26.950 --> 02:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
right to a clean
 
02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
environment one of my colleagues in the
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee raised a good point one with
 
02:22:32.429 --> 02:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
which I do not
 
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
disagree he suggested that an amendment
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
like this exists in order to invite
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuits as we have seen for example in
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
the state of
 
02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
Montana and my response is that's right
 
02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
because that is how we debate and
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
defined and defend fundamental rights is
 
02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
through our court system and through
 
02:22:56.429 --> 02:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
bodies such as
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
this we talk about the financial deficit
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
avoiding deficits the irresponsibility
 
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the financial deficit that is accured
 
02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:07.429 align:start position:0%
of the financial deficit that is accured
in

02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
Washington so my question Mr Speaker
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
today is what about the moral deficit
 
02:23:15.309 --> 02:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
what about our
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility as steward of the
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
environment to our children and to our
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
grandchildren like most of my colleagues
 
02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
in this body I am a parent like many of
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
my colleagues in this body I am a
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
grandparent and I know that there is
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
nothing that I wouldn't give including
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
my life to stand between my children or
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
my grandson and imminent
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
danger and I'm confident that that is
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
true of every parent and every
 
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
grandparent in this body
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
well I suggest that we are I do more
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
than suggest we are facing imminent
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
danger now 2023 was the hottest year on
 
02:23:59.950 --> 02:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
record and it is likely to be the
 
02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
coolest year of the rest of our
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
lives there is imminent danger now and
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
we refuse when we refuse to take action
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
we are refusing to accept the moral
 
02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we have to fure
 
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.830 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we have to fure
future

02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
Generations I ask my colleagues in the
 
02:24:27.309 --> 02:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
house to uh vote to overturn the itl so
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we can begin to accept the
 
02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we should have been
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
accepting for a long time now and allow
 
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
you representative katton recognized to
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%

importance of protecting our environment
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
but felt that the language in C cacr 14
 
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
would not serve to enhance our efforts
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
to improve the grant State
 
02:25:17.389 --> 02:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
environment Grant state is dedicated to
 
02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
improving our environment without this

series of rhetorical questions but
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
before I do that I I may point out the
 
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
last time I participate in floor fight
 
02:27:47.269 --> 02:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
over cacr the speaker who was then
 
02:27:50.190 --> 02:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
speaker Chandler to um actually had to
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
cast a vote so you may actually have to
 
02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
use your button and I'll tell you which
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
button I think you should press if that
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
happens M thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
that we the people of New Hampshire V
 
02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
always had a strong connection to the
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
Earth as shown by the fact we call
 
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves Granite Staters after the uh
 
02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
rock that bed rock that underlies um
 
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
almost the entirety of our
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
state if I know that we the people of
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have always understood the
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
importance of passing on a clean and
 
02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
healthful environment to Future
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
Generations so our grandchildren's
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
grandchildren grandchildren can continue
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
to live free long after we all
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
die and if I know that there's a good
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
reason to be confident that a 2third
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
super majority of our fellow uh of our
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%

Speaker as legislators we're called upon
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
very often
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
to look at a particular scenario
 
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
consider all of the permutations that
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
might happen and come to a decision as
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
to how those should be handled once in a
 
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
while there's something we don't think
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
of and this bill pertains to one of
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.710 --> 02:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
situations imagine that you enjoy the
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
outdoors you have a uh a non-resident
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%

in

02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:34:13.070 --> 02:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but you have a home on the
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast and you have a boat there you
 
02:34:16.750 --> 02:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
take your boat out for the day
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
you go down to Massachusetts uh maybe
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
pick up some friends do some lobstering
 
02:34:25.950 --> 02:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:29.309 --> 02:34:29.319 align:start position:0%
Lobster now you bring it back pull up to
 
02:34:29.319 --> 02:34:30.469 align:start position:0%
Lobster now you bring it back pull up to
the

02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
dock and as you start to take the
 
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
lobster on the off the boat you realize
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
problem in order to carry that Lobster
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
from your boat to the dock and on to
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
land you need a landing license
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
you need a commercial Lobster Landing
 
02:34:51.190 --> 02:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
license there is no non-commercial
 
02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
version of this you need a commercial
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
Lobster Landing license the cost of that
 
02:34:57.389 --> 02:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
license is
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
alternative before you come back to New
 
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Waters you could pull your
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
boat into a Massachusetts
 
02:35:11.269 --> 02:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
Port call up Uber on your mobile phone
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
Drive the lobster back to New Hampshire
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
get back in the Uber drive back to your
 
02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:18.349 align:start position:0%
get back in the Uber drive back to your
boat

02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
and go
 
02:35:23.230 --> 02:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
home that probably cost you less than
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
the $500 that it will cost you for a
 
02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:29.070 align:start position:0%
the $500 that it will cost you for a
landing

02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.110 --> 02:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
license this bill simply removes that
 
02:35:35.469 --> 02:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
Landing license requirement for anyone
 
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
who is harvesting lobster for non
 
02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.150 align:start position:0%
who is harvesting lobster for non
non-commercial

02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
non-commercial
 
02:35:43.870 --> 02:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
purposes now you will hear objections
 
02:35:47.469 --> 02:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
that um the the uh federal government
 
02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
needs to track the the statistics with
 
02:35:53.309 --> 02:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
regard to the catch if you have a
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
non-resident Mass Massachusetts
 
02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
lobstering license you are already
 
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so this bill simply
 
02:36:08.349 --> 02:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
removes what I believe is is an
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
oversight kind of a bureaucratic snafu
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
that leaves some people in some
 
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
situations with that dilemma do they
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
break the law do they pay pay $500 or do
 
02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
they jump through hoops um to try to get
 
02:36:26.910 --> 02:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
their lobster back uh back home I urge
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to vote no so that a new
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%

cost for a landing license is $50 which
 
02:38:13.469 --> 02:38:13.479 align:start position:0%
can be reduced to $40 if they choose
 
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
instead to buy a recreational lober

02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
inquiry uh thank you Mr Speaker uh Mr
 
02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that it is allowable
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire residents to catch
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
lobsters or crabs recreationally in
 
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
federal waters and if I know that these
 
02:41:22.590 --> 02:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
lobsters are crabs cart recreationally
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
are only intended for personal
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
consumption not commercial sale if I
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
also know that currently a New Hampshire
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
resident must purchase a landing license
 
02:41:34.469 --> 02:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
in order to bring those lobsters home
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
for his own his or her own personal
 
02:41:40.670 --> 02:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
use and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:41:43.389 --> 02:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
that regardless of the price of that
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
Landing license that Li license is an
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
unneeded tax on the person who catches
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
Lobster and crabs for their own personal
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
consumption therefore what I then press
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
the red button so that another amendment
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill would eliminate
 
02:42:14.830 --> 02:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
the reporting process for lobsters taken
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the state for recreational
 
02:42:20.190 --> 02:42:20.200 align:start position:0%

02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
reporting process is actually required
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%

02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill's been before us multiple
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
times and we've disposed of it
 
02:46:19.710 --> 02:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately because fishing game sets
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
their own dates and seasons and if I
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
further know that the reason that we set
 
02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
dates and seasons is to control a
 
02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
population that might be in danger uh
 
02:46:30.510 --> 02:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
without those dates and seasons and
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
coyotes are not such a animal and if I
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
know we have a very long day ahead of us
 
02:46:38.190 --> 02:46:38.200 align:start position:0%

02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
know that house bill 1100 is a bill that
 
02:46:57.550 --> 02:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
simply closes coyote hunting season
 
02:47:00.990 --> 02:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
during the weeks of coyote pup raising
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
like we do for other animals in New
 
02:47:06.429 --> 02:47:06.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that you can still hunt
 
02:47:09.309 --> 02:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
them outside of this season and that you
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
can always trap nuisance coyotes at any
 
02:47:17.230 --> 02:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
time and if I know that by not hunting
 
02:47:20.190 --> 02:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
coyotes during this time period you are
 
02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
actually controlling the coyote
 
02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
population far better than you would by
 
02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
hunting them and finally if I know that
 
02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
orphaned pups actually cause a greater
 
02:47:34.590 --> 02:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
threat to humans due to the lack of
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
training from the adults in the pack
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:43.080 align:start position:0%

with the following resolution resolved

representative James Murphy for the

oppose
 
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
nay the eyes have it and the Amendments
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
adopted now the motion is ought to pass
 
02:52:46.750 --> 02:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
as a amended representative Weber is
 
02:52:50.349 --> 02:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
02:52:56.750 --> 02:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 1194 as written and
 
02:52:59.750 --> 02:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
amended removes the word infectious from
 
02:53:02.190 --> 02:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
the definition of non-communicable
 
02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
diseases and as such it effectively
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
requires immunization only against those
 
02:53:10.750 --> 02:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
diseases except for tetanus which we
 
02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:11.469 align:start position:0%
diseases except for tetanus which we
just

02:53:11.469 --> 02:53:11.479 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:53:16.110 --> 02:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
fixed um that can
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:23.110 --> 02:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
person while the amendment removing
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
tetanus improves the bill it still
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
leaves open the problem that there are
 
02:53:32.190 --> 02:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
other diseases that can transfer and are
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
very readily transferable without
 
02:53:34.319 --> 02:53:35.429 align:start position:0%
very readily transferable without
person-to-person

02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
person-to-person
 
02:53:37.630 --> 02:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
contact and they may require
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
immunization to protect the population
 
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
at large let's be clear about the
 
02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
science involved in the accuracy of the
 
02:53:47.469 --> 02:53:47.479 align:start position:0%
proposed definition and impact while all
 
02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases are infectious not
 
02:53:52.349 --> 02:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
all infections are
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
communicable for example and similar to
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
tetanus there are many infections and
 
02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.120 align:start position:0%

02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
to the public as climate change is

with the rapid Ascent of climate change
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%

02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 1194 removes the word
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
infectious from the definition of a
 
02:56:08.429 --> 02:56:08.439 align:start position:0%
non-communicable disease as it relates
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the requirement for immunization and
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
clarifies that a non-communicable
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
disease is a disease that is not
 
02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
transmissible from person to person the
 
02:56:19.309 --> 02:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
United States and the state of New
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have always understood that
 
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
the individual has a fundamental right
 
02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
to exercise sovereignty over their own
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
medical decisions and this understanding
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
is the driving force behind the patient
 
02:56:33.429 --> 02:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights and the requirements
 
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
around informed consent these Concepts
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
also carry over into the discussion
 
02:56:40.630 --> 02:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
about vaccination
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
requirements in spite of this
 
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
understanding it is also also recognized
 
02:56:46.990 --> 02:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
that an individual's medical sovereignty
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
is not absolute and in its Landmark 1905
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
decision Jacobson versus
 
02:56:55.590 --> 02:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the United States Supreme
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
Court put forth the grounds upon which
 
02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
the state might override individual
 
02:57:02.429 --> 02:57:02.439 align:start position:0%
sovereignty and mandate a
 
02:57:05.830 --> 02:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine in Jacobson the court argued
 
02:57:07.830 --> 02:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
that the state could not arbitrarily put
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
forth a vaccine mandate but it might
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
proceed if two conditions are met first
 
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
first does the Mandate have an a
 
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
substantial relation to its intended
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
object and second does the Mandate not
 
02:57:24.429 --> 02:57:24.439 align:start position:0%
violate a fundamental
 
02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:27.279 align:start position:0%
right the bipartisan majority of the
 
02:57:29.070 --> 02:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
health and human services and elderly
 
02:57:31.389 --> 02:57:31.399 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee felt that in the case
 
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
of diseases transmitted from person to
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
person both of these conditions are met
 
02:57:39.990 --> 02:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
for example if a nurse and a Maternity
 
02:57:41.910 --> 02:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
Ward were not vaccinated for whooping
 
02:57:44.150 --> 02:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
cough it could pass to the ward like
 
02:57:46.590 --> 02:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
Wildfire with potentially devastating
 
02:57:49.950 --> 02:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
consequences for the infants housed
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
within however the majority also felt
 
02:57:55.469 --> 02:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
that requiring vaccination for diseases
 
02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
spread by non-human vectors Falls
 
02:58:00.830 --> 02:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the standard set in Jacobson
 
02:58:02.469 --> 02:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
and that the decision to pursue
 
02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination in such cases should rightly
 
02:58:07.389 --> 02:58:07.399 align:start position:0%
be left to the individual or the parents
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the case and of minor children being
 
02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
involved the language presented in HB
 
02:58:16.710 --> 02:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
1194 respects the spirit of Jacobson by
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
upholding the right to mandate to
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
preserve her immunity in the case of
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%

02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%

02:58:31.630 --> 02:58:31.640 align:start position:0%

you I'm a physician who believes

prevention is the best medicine and
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to hb1 1213
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
FN while the amendment that we will
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
better we're not

amendment right but I didn't call
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
it the question is on Amendment
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
0810 printed on house record 9 on page
 
04:24:59.070 --> 04:24:59.080 align:start position:0%

prevention is the best medicine in speak
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
in opposition to hp1 1213 FN while the
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
amendment just pass makes the bill
 
04:25:25.870 --> 04:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
better by continuing to require private
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
schools to maintain documentation of CH
 
04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
children's immunization records or
 
04:25:33.109 --> 04:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
exemption the bill deletes the
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
requirement for child care facilities
 
04:25:36.870 --> 04:25:36.880 align:start position:0%

one of the most effective Public Health
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
prevention measures we don't want to go
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
back to 1938 when my mother who had
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
contracted polio at the age of 11 was
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
just lucky to
 
04:26:48.109 --> 04:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
survive I'm also concerned that the
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:26:52.990 --> 04:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
bureau chief for reporting requirements
 
04:26:54.670 --> 04:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
testified before our committee that this
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill would put New Hampshire out of
 
04:26:59.229 --> 04:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal reporting
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
requirements this could jeopardize
 
04:27:04.389 --> 04:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
federal child care block
 
04:27:07.229 --> 04:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
grants this bill would weaken one of our
 
04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
most effective Public Health protection
 
04:27:11.070 --> 04:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
measures for young children and Child
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
Care staff would put us out of
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal reporting
 
04:27:18.030 --> 04:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and would not significantly
 
04:27:20.550 --> 04:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative burden on child

motion thank you Mr Speaker and I'd like
 
04:27:29.630 --> 04:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
a division vote
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
please representative Barry's recognized
 
04:27:34.109 --> 04:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
to speak for the
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
um with all uh due respect to my member
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
from the other side uh this is not a
 
04:27:45.070 --> 04:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
bill about vaccines this bill does not
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
change the requirement to get vaccinated
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.109 --> 04:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
141-a the reporting requirement for
 
04:27:55.870 --> 04:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
child care centers which have no
 
04:27:57.790 --> 04:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
business collecting this information
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is Private health information this
 
04:28:03.070 --> 04:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with taking a vaccine
 
04:28:04.750 --> 04:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
you still have to get a vaccine or you
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
have to sign the religious way W these
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
childcare centers have the option to
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
hand out a religious waiver they have no
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
ability to determine if that religious
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
waiver if signed is legitimate or not it
 
04:28:17.710 --> 04:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
would be grossly inappropriate for them
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
to do so what does happen is the
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:28:24.990 --> 04:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
issues citations for this massive
 
04:28:27.550 --> 04:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork requirement bluntly speaking
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
the reason why my colleag from the other
 
04:28:31.750 --> 04:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
side wrote from the YMCA is because the
 
04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
YMCA has a staff of hundreds so it's
 
04:28:37.030 --> 04:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
very easy for them to maintain this but
 
04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
if you are one of the many small
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
businesses servicing CH children between
 
04:28:43.269 --> 04:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 or 40 or 50 Children the
 
04:28:44.670 --> 04:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
average size of a Childcare Center in
 
04:28:46.030 --> 04:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire this is a very
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
burdensome requirement so what happens
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
when they're out of requirement with
 
04:28:51.950 --> 04:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
this what happens is they get a notice
 
04:28:54.990 --> 04:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
of findings then insurance companies go
 
04:28:57.030 --> 04:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
and pull that notice of findings and
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
they raise the rates in the child care
 
04:29:01.590 --> 04:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
providers those rate costs are then
 
04:29:04.750 --> 04:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
passed on to Working Families so this
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill does not stop the requirement to
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated all it does is remove a
 
04:29:11.469 --> 04:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement that is uniquely
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
placed onto Child Care Centers we don't
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
place this burden on at home care we
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
only place it on Child Care Centers so
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
if you support getting the government
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
out of this unnecessary function let
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
Child Care Centers provide child care
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
and stop being reporting arms for DHHS I

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:31:01.469 --> 04:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
if I know that many New Hampshire
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
Healthcare organizations opposed this
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill and in fact indicated they were
 
04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
worried that the rate of vaccination
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
would go down if this passes and if I
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
know the Department of Health and Human
 
04:31:13.950 --> 04:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
Services testified that this bill would
 
04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
put New Hampshire out of compliance with
 
04:31:18.429 --> 04:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
federal reporting requirements and
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
jeopardize Child Care um block grants
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
which might lose money for the daycare
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
centers that are really struggling at
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
this point and if I know our primary
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
focus should be on the health and safety
 
04:31:33.349 --> 04:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
of our children and not on paperwork
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
burden then would I now press the red
 
04:31:37.109 --> 04:31:37.119 align:start position:0%

ways to collect this information that
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve involving an entity that
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
is not in the business of healthcare

04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee on

Municipal and County government to which
 
04:34:51.670 --> 04:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
is referred House Bill 1250 an act
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
enabling the creation of certain Village
 
04:34:55.390 --> 04:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
districts having considered the same
 
04:34:56.910 --> 04:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
report the same with the recommendation
 
04:34:58.109 --> 04:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
that the bill ought to pass
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Laurel stavis for the
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee the minority
 
04:35:03.070 --> 04:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee having considered the
 
04:35:04.590 --> 04:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
same and being unable to agree with the
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
majority Report with the following
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
resolution resolved that it is
 
04:35:10.029 --> 04:35:10.039 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate representative
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
Tim Cahill for the minority of the
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
committee representative Richard Brown
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
is recognized speak against the
 
04:35:15.320 --> 04:35:25.949 align:start position:0%
is recognized speak against the
committee

04:35:25.949 --> 04:35:25.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:28.750 --> 04:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
opposition to the a to pass motion this
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislation would permit the creation of
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
Village districts for the alleged
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
purpose purpose of protecting lakes and
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
bodies of water there are many issues
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
that arise that make this legislation
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
unacceptable first these districts could
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
and would likely span multiple towns for
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
example Lake wiip pasak could
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
include uh excuse me could include molor
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Alton about 20 miles apart at
 
04:35:59.470 --> 04:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
opposite and ends of the lake and then
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
all towns in between if you look at
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
molteno alone for instance we have both
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
Lake Ken ATA and lake
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
winaki with significantly different
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
issues kisaka with serious cyan cyan
 
04:36:16.670 --> 04:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
bacteria issues and lake winaki with
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
significantly different issues which are
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
more General and of a wider
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
variety potential issues that should be
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
addressed specifically based on the
 
04:36:25.400 --> 04:36:26.510 align:start position:0%
addressed specifically based on the
local

04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
impacts are the interests of these in
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
Alton of those in Alton wolfboro lacone
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
and molteno the same I suggest no
 
04:36:38.429 --> 04:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
next in the process of creating these
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
districts properties included in these
 
04:36:43.230 --> 04:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
districts would vote to approve or
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
disapprove if 51% voted to approve and
 
04:36:48.750 --> 04:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
49% voted
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
against the 49% would be subject to
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
assessments fees and added taxes
 
04:36:57.750 --> 04:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
troubling is that fines and penalties
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
could be assessed to perceived offending
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
parties what's troubling is that this
 
04:37:07.310 --> 04:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
was mentioned specifically as a positive
 
04:37:11.230 --> 04:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
note when we received written
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
testimony now to the properties the
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
planners would include in the village
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
districts those properties would all be
 
04:37:20.310 --> 04:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
lake or waterfront properties
 
04:37:23.429 --> 04:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
right wrong properties could includ
 
04:37:25.830 --> 04:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
those not along Waterfront as for
 
04:37:28.750 --> 04:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
example elevated lands not AB budding a
 
04:37:30.750 --> 04:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
water body could be claimed to have
 
04:37:30.760 --> 04:37:32.269 align:start position:0%
water body could be claimed to have
runoff

04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
runoff
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
effects so they are included in the
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
district or how about a property with
 
04:37:39.629 --> 04:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
septic system that creators believe may
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
be contributing to seage into the lake
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
or what about a farmer's property miles
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
from the lakefront where's acreages
 
04:37:48.670 --> 04:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
along a stream that meanders its way to
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
the lake can the planets of the district
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
save fertilizer on the farmer's land may
 
04:37:56.029 --> 04:37:56.039 align:start position:0%
be leaking into the Stream So that his
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
land as well as the properties along the
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
stream are also included and everyone
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
here can imagine how you could have your
 
04:38:06.189 --> 04:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
own scenario where property is not on
 
04:38:08.590 --> 04:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
the body of water could be gerrymandered
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
into the
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
district while sponsors see The Virtue
 
04:38:16.029 --> 04:38:16.039 align:start position:0%
in this bill many assert and believe
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
that this would become a huge
 
04:38:21.510 --> 04:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
infringement on their property rights
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
many lakes have formed associations as a
 
04:38:26.709 --> 04:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis to accomplish what the
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
bill wishes to do for instance in
 
04:38:32.910 --> 04:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
molteno where I live lake kakka has an
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
association which is currently
 
04:38:38.189 --> 04:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
addressing in a serious cyanobacteria
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
issue I live on molon Boro Bay on Winn
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
 and we have the Geneva Point
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
Association which looks at Lake issues
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
and helps fund them
 
04:38:51.150 --> 04:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
voluntarily the clear difference is that
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
this bill uses the heavy-handed the
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
heavy hand of bureaucracy in a mandatory
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
top- down all-in way those of us against
 
04:39:00.160 --> 04:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
top- down all-in way those of us against
top

04:39:01.750 --> 04:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
top
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
down all the way in those of us against
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
the OTP motion preferred a lighter touch
 
04:39:11.551 --> 04:39:11.561 align:start position:0%
in the use of a bottomup local approach
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
I encourage my colleagues to join me in
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
this property right anti-prop rights
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
legislation by pressing the red button
 
04:39:23.349 --> 04:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
so that a better motion can be made
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:39:27.390 --> 04:39:27.400 align:start position:0%

remediate them such a village District
 
04:41:13.470 --> 04:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
would also give members access to

Representatives if I know that this is
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
only enabling legislation and there are
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
14 items which are covered under the

existing Special Districts legislation
 
04:44:03.550 --> 04:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
this would create a 15th one and if I

know that h B1 1250 follows a long list

I know that combining the efforts of
 
04:44:21.788 --> 04:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
several towns will provide a greater
 
04:44:24.990 --> 04:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Grants outside funding
 
04:44:27.788 --> 04:44:27.798 align:start position:0%

04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill is desired by many towns within the

allowing multiple areas within various
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:10:54.510 --> 05:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
that this body has already passed House
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 1278 Which is far broader reaching
 
05:10:58.990 --> 05:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
allowing Physicians to write a

05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
adult and further if I know that that
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill stands a far greater chance of uh
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately becoming law than this bill
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
and lastly if I know that I was going to
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
make a 420 joke about 45 minutes ago uh
 
05:11:14.470 --> 05:11:14.480 align:start position:0%

also if I believe believe that the bills
 
05:11:35.548 --> 05:11:35.558 align:start position:0%

sovereignty over my own body and if I

know the state reporting to own my body
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%

those who receive organs would also like
 
05:15:39.868 --> 05:15:39.878 align:start position:0%
the option to give the donor more than
 
05:15:42.510 --> 05:15:42.520 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr

Speaker House Bill
 
05:18:15.470 --> 05:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
1660 extends far beyond the prohibitions
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
that we already voted on earlier this
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
year that was a Prohibition on gender re
 
05:18:25.948 --> 05:18:25.958 align:start position:0%
gen genital gender reassignment
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
surgery this bill would prohibit
 
05:18:32.910 --> 05:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid from paying for any kind of
 
05:18:36.110 --> 05:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment surgery so that
 
05:18:39.990 --> 05:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
means breast surgery as well as genital
 
05:18:42.510 --> 05:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
surgery now we are all
 
05:18:47.788 --> 05:18:47.798 align:start position:0%
agreed that for the most part it is best
 
05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
to wait until 18 before these decisions
 
05:18:51.320 --> 05:18:52.590 align:start position:0%
to wait until 18 before these decisions
are

05:18:52.590 --> 05:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:18:52.600 --> 05:18:54.310 align:start position:0%
are
taken

05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
taken
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
however in some
 
05:19:02.110 --> 05:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
cases it is absolutely lifesaving
 
05:19:06.390 --> 05:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
surgery and if agreed to by the
 
05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
individual the individual's parent or
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
Guardian the various Health Care
 
05:19:17.350 --> 05:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
Providers it's a real necessity for the
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
individual that needs it and families
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
should be left to make those
 
05:19:27.788 --> 05:19:27.798 align:start position:0%
decisions and if we prohibit Medicaid
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
for paying for this
 
05:19:33.150 --> 05:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
surgery we are
 
05:19:36.430 --> 05:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
creating a
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination against those who are
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
poor we're creating two different kinds
 
05:19:45.310 --> 05:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
of Medical Practice one for those with
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
resources and one for those
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
without and
 
05:19:52.670 --> 05:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
secondly we are creating a
 
05:19:52.680 --> 05:19:54.310 align:start position:0%
secondly we are creating a
discriminatory

05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
category because we are labeling one
 
05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
particular group of people as being
 
05:20:05.310 --> 05:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
Unworthy of medical
 
05:20:08.350 --> 05:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
treatment the concern that I have is
 
05:20:11.430 --> 05:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill is part of what is an
 
05:20:11.440 --> 05:20:13.150 align:start position:0%
that this bill is part of what is an
emerging

05:20:13.150 --> 05:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
emerging
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
fabric of
 
05:20:18.310 --> 05:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
attacks on people who are
 
05:20:22.510 --> 05:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus and I don't think we ought to
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
be going down that road I don't think we
 
05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
ought to be creating two tiers of
 
05:20:32.430 --> 05:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
medical practice and I think we ought to
 
05:20:36.990 --> 05:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
be pressing the red button on ought to
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
pass so a better motion can be made
 
05:20:39.440 --> 05:20:40.510 align:start position:0%
pass so a better motion can be made

Speaker in early January this house took

Speaker in early January this house took
the

05:20:54.510 --> 05:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
position that children should not be
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
undergoing permanent irreversible
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
surgery in New Hampshire
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
that they may very well
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
regret this bill is extraordinarily
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
simple it states that the New Hampshire
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program will not cover gender
 
05:21:21.868 --> 05:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:24.150 --> 05:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
children to those who would say this
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
creates some kind of two-tier Health
 
05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
Care System there are numerous private
 
05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
healthcare plans that do not cover these
 
05:21:37.070 --> 05:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
adults the opposing committee report
 
05:21:43.868 --> 05:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:46.590 --> 05:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory this bill merely
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
asserts that taxpayers should not be on
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
the hook to pay for gender reassignment
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:59.670 --> 05:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
minors not only is that taking money
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
scarce public resource versus out of

05:22:06.910 --> 05:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
coffers it is also potentially creating
 
05:22:09.390 --> 05:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
a liability for the State of New
 
05:22:12.990 --> 05:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because there are huge issues
 
05:22:17.230 --> 05:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh huge questions remaining around
 
05:22:19.548 --> 05:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
liability when someone comes back later
 
05:22:19.558 --> 05:22:20.390 align:start position:0%

adequately

screened the the opposing committee
 
05:22:33.470 --> 05:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
reports ass asserts that this is
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
discriminatory I would assert that there
 
05:22:38.788 --> 05:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
are a number of things that we do not
 
05:22:41.390 --> 05:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
allow children to do in the state of New
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including drinking alcohol
 
05:22:47.948 --> 05:22:47.958 align:start position:0%
smoking cigarettes in fact in the state
 
05:22:49.868 --> 05:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we do not allow

05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
salon in light of that it does not sound
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
discriminatory it's sounds like common
 
05:23:03.070 --> 05:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
sense that we do not want to use
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds to fund gender
 
05:23:07.628 --> 05:23:07.638 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery that is
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
irreversible and highly likely to cause
 
05:23:10.718 --> 05:23:11.628 align:start position:0%

Speaker cacr 12 is a constitutional
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
amendment designed to correct the
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
erroneous New Hampshire Supreme Court 19
 
05:35:04.868 --> 05:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
N 1993 Claremont
 
05:35:07.470 --> 05:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
decision that decision said that this
 
05:35:10.270 --> 05:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
phrase in part two of article three of
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
art part two article 83 of the
 
05:35:16.270 --> 05:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution which reads in part it
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
shall be the duty of legislators to
 
05:35:22.670 --> 05:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
cherish the interest of literature The
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
Sciences and all seminaries and public
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
schools um that they ruled that that
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
requires us to allocate funds from
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide sources to pay for an adequate
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
education for all
 
05:35:46.110 --> 05:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
students cacr 12 is designed to nudge
 
05:35:49.230 --> 05:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court to a correct
 
05:35:52.750 --> 05:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that part of the
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution so first of all I want to
 
05:35:58.590 --> 05:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
dispel the notion that the constitution
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
is something that could only be
 
05:36:03.788 --> 05:36:03.798 align:start position:0%
understood by experts and judges and the
 
05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and so on the Constitution
 
05:36:10.910 --> 05:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
was created in uh
 
05:36:13.788 --> 05:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
1784 um it was the draft was made by a
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
committee who took the Constitution from
 
05:36:19.548 --> 05:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts made some modifications
 
05:36:22.430 --> 05:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
and sent it out to all of the towns
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
where the people read it they met in
 
05:36:27.868 --> 05:36:27.878 align:start position:0%
their um annual
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
meeting and voted on it and they voted
 
05:36:32.520 --> 05:36:33.830 align:start position:0%
meeting and voted on it and they voted
it

05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:36:38.910 --> 05:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
down and they sent suggestions back to
 
05:36:41.230 --> 05:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh the committee the committee over the
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
next period made
 
05:36:46.390 --> 05:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
changes um sent new copies out to the
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
towns all the people read it they
 
05:36:51.990 --> 05:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
discussed it they voted on it and they
 
05:36:53.548 --> 05:36:53.558 align:start position:0%
turned it
 
05:36:56.670 --> 05:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
down so same process the people sent
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
more suggestions to the
 
05:37:02.190 --> 05:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh the committee made changes
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
they they reiterated they sent new
 
05:37:05.948 --> 05:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
copies of the towns they discussed it
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the third time was the charm so our
 
05:37:12.670 --> 05:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
constitution was read by Ordinary People
 
05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
was voted on by Ordinary People it it
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
does not contain weird obscure language
 
05:37:22.270 --> 05:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
that that only only judges can
 
05:37:25.110 --> 05:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
understand the second notion that's in
 
05:37:29.230 --> 05:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
the Claremont decision is that the word
 
05:37:32.948 --> 05:37:32.958 align:start position:0%
ch Parish itself had sort of an obscure
 
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
18th century meaning that is different
 
05:37:38.948 --> 05:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
than our our meaning today right because
 
05:37:40.910 --> 05:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
today we would just think okay we're
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to encourage or like or support or
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
something like that but but that the
 
05:37:49.548 --> 05:37:49.558 align:start position:0%
meaning was specifically you know must
 
05:37:49.558 --> 05:37:50.510 align:start position:0%
meaning was specifically you know must
pay

05:37:50.510 --> 05:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
pay
 
05:37:54.190 --> 05:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
for and that is not true either so my
 
05:37:55.990 --> 05:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
Authority for this is the gentleman
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
standing behind me
 
05:37:58.520 --> 05:38:00.948 align:start position:0%
standing behind me
here

05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:38:02.910 --> 05:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean our Clerk or you Mr
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker I mean George
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
Washington okay so George Washington
 
05:38:11.310 --> 05:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
served as president for eight years and
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
his most famous speech is his farewell
 
05:38:16.548 --> 05:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
address in
 
05:38:19.470 --> 05:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
1796 and in that Farewell Address he
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
happened to use the word cherish three
 
05:38:24.590 --> 05:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
times and I would submit to you he used
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
it exactly as we would today he said
 
05:38:30.628 --> 05:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
that we should cherish our National
 
05:38:33.750 --> 05:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
union he said that we should cherish
 
05:38:35.868 --> 05:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
religion and
 
05:38:37.910 --> 05:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
morality and he said that we should
 
05:38:40.230 --> 05:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
cherish the Public
 
05:38:42.430 --> 05:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
Credit right so we shouldn't borrow too
 
05:38:44.590 --> 05:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
much money unfortunately we haven't
 
05:38:48.070 --> 05:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
listened to him but you know all right
 
05:38:50.670 --> 05:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
so the Supreme Court made a big deal of
 
05:38:53.990 --> 05:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
of looking up the word cherish in a 1784
 
05:38:56.830 --> 05:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
dictionary and they found it to say to
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
support to shelter to nurse up
 
05:39:02.390 --> 05:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
well you could maybe think of nursing up
 
05:39:05.990 --> 05:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
that might include some paying for right
 
05:39:08.310 --> 05:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
but the problem is the the next line in
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
the dictionary defines
 
05:39:12.670 --> 05:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
cherisher as an
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
encourager or a
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
supporter right so now we're thinking
 
05:39:19.628 --> 05:39:19.638 align:start position:0%
about people who like the Patriots or
 
05:39:22.510 --> 05:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
something like that right and um and the
 
05:39:25.270 --> 05:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
following word was
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
similar um cherishment means
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
encouragement support Comfort it doesn't
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
really mean pay for okay and then then
 
05:39:38.948 --> 05:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
their further step of saying how much we
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
had to pay that we had to fully pay
 
05:39:43.788 --> 05:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's just glossed over in the
 
05:39:43.798 --> 05:39:45.030 align:start position:0%
that's just glossed over in the
Claremont

05:39:45.030 --> 05:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
Claremont
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
decision okay and then the obvious
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
question is if we interpret cherish
 
05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
literature Sciences all seminaries and
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
public schools as meaning send a defined
 
05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money to schools the obvious
 
05:39:59.040 --> 05:40:00.628 align:start position:0%
amount of money to schools the obvious
question

05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:40:05.150 --> 05:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
is where are the checks for authors and
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
scientists and
 
05:40:10.590 --> 05:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
seminaries right that's somehow ignored
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
Court and then
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
finally um there's the original part one
 
05:40:22.350 --> 05:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
article six of this of the Constitution
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
that had was in it at the same time as
 
05:40:28.350 --> 05:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
this phrase and that one says that the
 
05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
people empowered the legislature to
 
05:40:34.270 --> 05:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
authorize the several towns to make
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
adequate provision at their own
 
05:40:41.910 --> 05:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
expense for the support and maintenance
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
of public Protestant
 
05:40:48.110 --> 05:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
teachers okay so we are authorized at at
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
that time we were authorized to to have
 
05:40:54.430 --> 05:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
towns um give money at at their own
 
05:40:58.590 --> 05:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
expense and to to further that was the
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
fact that for the first 50 years that
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
the constitution was in effect the
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
legislature sent zero to towns for
 
05:41:10.590 --> 05:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
schools all right so now that we know
 
05:41:12.628 --> 05:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
that the Claremont decision was
 
05:41:14.750 --> 05:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect why should we do anything
 
05:41:17.310 --> 05:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
about it now right we've we've lived
 
05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
with it for 30 years we are certainly
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
going to keep supporting schools right
 
05:41:25.310 --> 05:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
so what's what's the the
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
urgency the question is not just not not
 
05:41:31.830 --> 05:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to support schools
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
but how and how
 
05:41:37.788 --> 05:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
much that's ultimately a legislative
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
decision not a Judicial
 
05:41:46.110 --> 05:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
one over the years this the state has
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
supported schools by filling in the gaps
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that occur uh between poorer and
 
05:41:54.000 --> 05:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
that occur uh between poorer and
wealthier

05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
wealthier
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
communities that's why a city like
 
05:42:00.468 --> 05:42:00.478 align:start position:0%
Berlin gets
 
05:42:04.230 --> 05:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
$111,000 a kid and a city like and a
 
05:42:09.070 --> 05:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:11.310 --> 05:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
nothing all right so these are
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
inherently political decisions which
 
05:42:15.548 --> 05:42:15.558 align:start position:0%
should be left up to the
 
05:42:19.468 --> 05:42:19.478 align:start position:0%
425 elected officials in this body as
 
05:42:22.110 --> 05:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
well as the go the one across the hall
 
05:42:23.430 --> 05:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:42:26.628 --> 05:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
governor and not unelected and
 
05:42:26.638 --> 05:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
governor and not unelected and
unaccountable

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
unaccountable
 
05:42:28.160 --> 05:42:29.910 align:start position:0%
unaccountable
judges

05:42:29.910 --> 05:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
judges
 
05:42:31.910 --> 05:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
now last year there was a court case
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
called conal and the judge in the conal
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
case told the state that we must spend a
 
05:42:42.670 --> 05:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
lot more money on education in
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
particular uh roughly 500 million doll
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
more that we must the state must send
 
05:42:53.350 --> 05:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
that that amount of money more to to the
 
05:42:53.360 --> 05:42:54.510 align:start position:0%
that that amount of money more to to the
public

05:42:54.510 --> 05:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:42:57.430 --> 05:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
schools now we can do that actually it's
 
05:43:00.510 --> 05:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's not that difficult we could put in
 
05:43:03.868 --> 05:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
150% increase in the Statewide education
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
property tax all right what that would
 
05:43:10.590 --> 05:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
do is shift money around just like we do
 
05:43:12.468 --> 05:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
every year in the budget when we make
 
05:43:14.190 --> 05:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
changes to the adequate education
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
formula we move money around and we
 
05:43:19.788 --> 05:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
create winners and we create
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
losers doing
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
this um will among the winners be
 
05:43:30.990 --> 05:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
suburbs that have a lot of kids
 
05:43:32.708 --> 05:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
wealthier suburbs that have a lot of
 
05:43:35.548 --> 05:43:35.558 align:start position:0%
kids such as Bedford and boow for
 
05:43:37.628 --> 05:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
example those are the kind of towns
 
05:43:39.750 --> 05:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
that'll be winners under the Supreme
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
Court's convel
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
decision and one other group that will
 
05:43:47.230 --> 05:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
be winners that might surprise
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
you is charter schools and
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
efas under the Supreme Court's
 
05:43:57.910 --> 05:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
formula um actually not the Supreme
 
05:44:00.948 --> 05:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
Court yet right this is a lower level
 
05:44:05.230 --> 05:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
judge but under the the conval formula
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools and efas will get an
 
05:44:08.080 --> 05:44:09.350 align:start position:0%
charter schools and efas will get an
extra

05:44:09.350 --> 05:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
extra
 
05:44:14.468 --> 05:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
$3,200 a kit right so efas will go up by
 
05:44:17.948 --> 05:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
50% and Charter Schools less than
 
05:44:21.070 --> 05:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
that but I'm sure that not everyone in
 
05:44:24.350 --> 05:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
this body would like that
 
05:44:28.230 --> 05:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
outcome so please let's overturn this
 
05:44:32.430 --> 05:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
itl mod motion and vote for bringing
 
05:44:35.548 --> 05:44:35.558 align:start position:0%
back these kind of decisions into the
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
legislature where they belong thank you
 
05:44:38.520 --> 05:44:40.990 align:start position:0%
legislature where they belong thank you
Mr

05:44:40.990 --> 05:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:43.390 --> 05:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative margorie Smith is
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.628 --> 05:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker the distinguished gentleman from
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
Epson made an a speech that I do not
 
05:45:08.150 --> 05:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
disagree with at all he talked about his
 
05:45:11.750 --> 05:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about several decisions made by
 
05:45:15.708 --> 05:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch that he believes uh
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
do not reflect certainly his values and
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
those values and those of other people
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
who share those values and that is a
 
05:45:25.080 --> 05:45:26.788 align:start position:0%
who share those values and that is a
legitimate

05:45:26.788 --> 05:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
respectable position
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
in fact the amendment
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
however is perhaps a little too clever
 
05:45:42.708 --> 05:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
by half the amendment changes nothing to
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
say cherish should be supplanted by
 
05:45:52.430 --> 05:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
Cherish does not inform this legislature
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
or inform the public that would have to
 
05:45:59.670 --> 05:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
vote on this that what the spons
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
envisioned is that therefore the
 
05:46:05.708 --> 05:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
legislature would no longer have to deal
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
with court involvement in deciding how
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
much the state should pay for Education
 
05:46:14.310 --> 05:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
if in
 
05:46:17.150 --> 05:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
fact the Judiciary Committee had before
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
it an amendment which
 
05:46:25.990 --> 05:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
said let's get the courts out of their
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
long-term responsibilities under the con
 
05:46:32.310 --> 05:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
institution and leave education strictly
 
05:46:35.350 --> 05:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
to the legislative branch some people
 
05:46:37.948 --> 05:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
would support that some people would not
 
05:46:41.948 --> 05:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
but they would know what the issue is to
 
05:46:45.150 --> 05:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
substitute the word cherish according to
 
05:46:45.160 --> 05:46:46.030 align:start position:0%
substitute the word cherish according to
a

05:46:46.030 --> 05:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:46:51.270 --> 05:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
1784 dictionary for the 2024 Miriam
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
Webster does not make that issue clear
 
05:46:57.788 --> 05:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
and for all of us who respect the
 
05:47:00.030 --> 05:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution and take it
 
05:47:02.990 --> 05:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
seriously if we want to make a change we
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
ought to be clear what that change is
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
and therefore on behalf of 16 members of
 
05:47:14.110 --> 05:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee um I hope that
 
05:47:18.868 --> 05:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
you will support our position to itl
 
05:47:22.110 --> 05:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
this Constitutional Amendment and in the
 
05:47:25.548 --> 05:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
fullness of time we will again and again
 
05:47:29.190 --> 05:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
and again revisit how we fund education
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
but we will do it by saying what we're
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
really doing thank you very much Mr

05:49:38.750 --> 05:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:49:40.548 --> 05:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
cac12 seeks to amend a Judicial
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation regarding education
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
funding to better align with the
 
05:49:51.430 --> 05:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
framer's actual intent and if I know the
 
05:49:53.788 --> 05:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
critical role of the term cherish in our
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
foundational documents and its
 
05:49:59.430 --> 05:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
problematic interpretation in the 1990s
 
05:50:01.468 --> 05:50:01.478 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision in which the state
 
05:50:04.708 --> 05:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
supreme court legislated from the bench
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
and used this word to justify a
 
05:50:09.708 --> 05:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
departure from two centuries old
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
practice of Educational Funding and if I
 
05:50:14.750 --> 05:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
know that the necessity of re re
 
05:50:16.990 --> 05:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
reinstating this legislature's authority
 
05:50:20.190 --> 05:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
to make sane budgetary decisions that we
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
need to correct this error to avoid
 
05:50:24.628 --> 05:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal policies that would require
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
potentially new broad-based
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
taxes and if I know that passing this
 
05:50:33.788 --> 05:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
amendment would allow this body and the
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
citizenry at large to inform the
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
judicial branch about the correct
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the word cherish would
 
05:50:43.628 --> 05:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
I now press the red button to defeat the
 
05:50:45.788 --> 05:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
itail motion so that a better motion
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I understand correctly the
 
05:51:11.230 --> 05:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
proposed cacr
 
05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
12 which seeks to replace the 1784 word

Constitution when there's nothing wrong
 
05:51:29.430 --> 05:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
with the word cherish
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't that raise a red flag that
 
05:51:35.430 --> 05:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
undermines the word cherishes meaning if
 
05:51:38.110 --> 05:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
I know that quibbling over semantics
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
although may seem
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
trivial but altering the language of the
 
05:51:45.628 --> 05:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
constitution in such
 
05:51:48.628 --> 05:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
a cutesy manner diminishes The
 
05:51:48.638 --> 05:51:50.750 align:start position:0%
a cutesy manner diminishes The
Constitution's

05:51:50.750 --> 05:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution's
 
05:51:53.110 --> 05:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
significance and if I know the
 
05:51:53.120 --> 05:51:54.150 align:start position:0%
significance and if I know the
difference

05:51:54.150 --> 05:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
between words like cherish as used in
 
05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
article 83 implies a solemn Duty and
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
obligation of the state government to
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
support public education whereas the
 
05:52:06.868 --> 05:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
word encouraged is used in article 83
 
05:52:09.548 --> 05:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
suggests a less binding commitment to
 
05:52:09.558 --> 05:52:10.670 align:start position:0%
suggests a less binding commitment to
private

05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
private
 
05:52:13.150 --> 05:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
institutions and if I know this SE
 
05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
semantic shift could have far-reaching
 
05:52:17.150 --> 05:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
implications for the state's
 
05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility towards funding public
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
education and the principles upheld by
 
05:52:24.270 --> 05:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
long-standing legal precedents such as
 
05:52:26.750 --> 05:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Claremont
 
05:52:28.788 --> 05:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
ruling and then
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
furthermore if if I know that this could
 
05:52:34.830 --> 05:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
potentially open the floodgates of other
 
05:52:38.910 --> 05:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
cacr amendments to be used as a tool to
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
alter language of in the in the
 
05:52:46.468 --> 05:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
Constitution and lastly if I know cac12
 
05:52:48.750 --> 05:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
does not uphold the Integrity of the
 
05:52:51.030 --> 05:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
democratic process or protect the
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%

05:52:57.350 --> 05:52:57.360 align:start position:0%

05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
like some full sugar honey iced tea then
 
05:53:04.590 --> 05:53:04.600 align:start position:0%

your calendar the bill the amendment was
 
06:10:22.708 --> 06:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
misrepresented and it said that my
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment crossed out the word ancestry
 
06:10:29.310 --> 06:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
and I I know that that was
 
06:10:34.070 --> 06:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
a mistake done in the calendar and if I

06:14:50.230 --> 06:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently asks for race
 
06:14:53.310 --> 06:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
and ancestry data on its marriage
 
06:14:57.270 --> 06:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
applications any here we go how's this
 
06:14:58.670 --> 06:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:15:01.070 --> 06:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay any couple going to their local
 
06:15:03.628 --> 06:15:03.638 align:start position:0%
clerk's office is asked to provide this
 
06:15:05.948 --> 06:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
information as part of the process for
 
06:15:08.270 --> 06:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
receiving a marriage
 
06:15:10.830 --> 06:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
license although the paperwork
 
06:15:12.788 --> 06:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
connecting a person to their race is
 
06:15:14.708 --> 06:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
ultimately destroyed after the data is
 
06:15:16.670 --> 06:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
collected and the marriage license is
 
06:15:20.270 --> 06:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
issued there's still a significant
 
06:15:23.468 --> 06:15:23.478 align:start position:0%
problem hb1 1220 would remove this
 
06:15:23.478 --> 06:15:25.190 align:start position:0%
problem hb1 1220 would remove this
unconstitutional

06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
06:15:28.190 --> 06:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
requirement the governor singled out
 
06:15:31.310 --> 06:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
this very Issue four years ago in a
 
06:15:33.310 --> 06:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
letter to the house speaker and the
 
06:15:35.670 --> 06:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
president of the other body urging them
 
06:15:37.750 --> 06:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
to find a legislative solution to the
 
06:15:41.948 --> 06:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
for this issue out of a more expansive
 
06:15:44.070 --> 06:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
Bill the interest that the Attorney
 
06:15:46.510 --> 06:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
General's office had in now revisiting
 
06:15:49.390 --> 06:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
this idea came about because it not only
 
06:15:51.510 --> 06:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
believes this is still a problem to be
 
06:15:54.070 --> 06:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
addressed in New Hampshire it is also
 
06:15:56.190 --> 06:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
aware of successful efforts to remove
 
06:15:58.510 --> 06:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
similar data collection requirements in
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
other state
 
06:16:02.150 --> 06:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
courts the primary reason to Halt this
 
06:16:04.670 --> 06:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
practice above all else is to protect
 
06:16:05.750 --> 06:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
access to
 
06:16:08.190 --> 06:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
marriage marriage is not simply an
 
06:16:10.270 --> 06:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
institution of belief it is a
 
06:16:10.280 --> 06:16:11.430 align:start position:0%
institution of belief it is a
fundamental

06:16:11.430 --> 06:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
06:16:14.030 --> 06:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
right those cases in other states W on
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
the argument that the requirement to
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
provide race and ancestry data would
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:24.670 --> 06:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
marrying more specifically it was
 
06:16:26.548 --> 06:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
determined to be a restriction of a
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
fundamental right with the law worthy of
 
06:16:31.070 --> 06:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
being assessed under the standard of
 
06:16:34.030 --> 06:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny the highest level of
 
06:16:36.788 --> 06:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional review by our court
 
06:16:39.510 --> 06:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
system the only way a law is allowed to
 
06:16:40.868 --> 06:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
impede the right to
 
06:16:43.310 --> 06:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
marry is the identification of a
 
06:16:45.628 --> 06:16:45.638 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest and the
 
06:16:48.788 --> 06:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire doesn't have one
 
06:16:50.830 --> 06:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office has worked
 
06:16:53.110 --> 06:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
with the division of Vital Records who
 
06:16:55.070 --> 06:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
shared that this data is not used for
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
any reason other than to just retain it
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
and it's mostly duplicative of US Census
 
06:17:04.590 --> 06:17:04.600 align:start position:0%

06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
the motion of ought to pass as amended
 
06:17:08.750 --> 06:17:08.760 align:start position:0%

hb220 is a vote to correct the
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional collection of race and

motion colleagues U on this motion the
 
06:21:41.590 --> 06:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment the only thing that it
 
06:21:44.070 --> 06:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
does is change the effective date of
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
this bill if it passes from 60 days to
 
06:21:50.830 --> 06:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
90 days this was a request made after
 
06:21:53.868 --> 06:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
the hearing by one of the court reporter
 
06:21:55.990 --> 06:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
representatives and I told the court
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
reporter representative that I would
 
06:22:00.670 --> 06:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
draft such an amendment by the at the
 
06:22:04.190 --> 06:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
for the to be to be uh for our executive
 
06:22:06.750 --> 06:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
session and I did have it drafted and we
 
06:22:08.548 --> 06:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
were so busy at the executive session
 
06:22:10.430 --> 06:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
that frankly I forgot to offer the
 
06:22:12.750 --> 06:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um I really felt badly about
 
06:22:14.150 --> 06:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
that because I made a commitment to this
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
person I would do it it's a perfectly
 
06:22:18.910 --> 06:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable request if the bill passes so
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
I hope I know we're going to have a
 
06:22:22.390 --> 06:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
debate on the bill itself but I hope
 
06:22:23.830 --> 06:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
everyone will be able to agree that this
 
06:22:25.868 --> 06:22:25.878 align:start position:0%
amendment is entirely appropriate and I
 
06:22:29.310 --> 06:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in favor of the
 
06:22:31.548 --> 06:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
amendment the questions on the adoption
 
06:22:34.350 --> 06:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
of amendment 0901 H are you ready for
 
06:22:37.510 --> 06:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
the question all those in favor say I I
 
06:22:40.190 --> 06:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
all those oppose nay the eyes have it
 
06:22:42.270 --> 06:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
and the Amendments adopted now the
 
06:22:43.868 --> 06:22:43.878 align:start position:0%
question is the main motion of ought to
 
06:22:45.948 --> 06:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
pass as amended representative margerie
 
06:22:53.270 --> 06:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:56.830 --> 06:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
motion Mr Speaker this is not the first
 
06:23:01.190 --> 06:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
time we have seen this language the
 
06:23:04.590 --> 06:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
language was initially proposed in House
 
06:23:10.468 --> 06:23:10.478 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 last year when there was um a
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
determined effort to uh cut down
 
06:23:18.430 --> 06:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
dramatically um the licensing and
 
06:23:23.750 --> 06:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
regulation uh of many many um entities
 
06:23:26.670 --> 06:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
in the state it was was pulled out of
 
06:23:30.750 --> 06:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 and it's now here as part of an
 
06:23:35.510 --> 06:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
effort on a caseby Case basis to De
 
06:23:37.390 --> 06:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
deregulate uh
 
06:23:40.070 --> 06:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
licensing and so you have to understand
 
06:23:42.830 --> 06:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a new issue but it's a very
 
06:23:46.628 --> 06:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
important issue I was privileged to be
 
06:23:50.110 --> 06:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
named by the speaker to serve on a
 
06:23:53.030 --> 06:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
special committee on the family
 
06:23:58.230 --> 06:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
court and we were worked very hard over
 
06:24:01.430 --> 06:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
the last year or so looking at what was
 
06:24:03.750 --> 06:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
happening in the Family Court listening
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
to people who had some concerns and
 
06:24:09.548 --> 06:24:09.558 align:start position:0%
trying to evaluate those
 
06:24:12.788 --> 06:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
concerns one part of that
 
06:24:15.830 --> 06:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
review that I must say gave me
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely no pleasure was to read
 
06:24:23.150 --> 06:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
transcripts that had been prepared in
 
06:24:27.310 --> 06:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
the Family Court trans that were full of
 
06:24:29.910 --> 06:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
Errors omissions
 
06:24:32.948 --> 06:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
confusion that not only meant that there
 
06:24:39.190 --> 06:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:41.628 --> 06:24:41.638 align:start position:0%
record as you know my mother taught me
 
06:24:44.070 --> 06:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
never to speak when others were speaking
 
06:24:50.270 --> 06:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:54.910 --> 06:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
close it was not only uh I an injustice
 
06:24:57.468 --> 06:24:57.478 align:start position:0%
perhaps for those people who were in the
 
06:25:00.910 --> 06:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
courts but for those of us who are
 
06:25:03.750 --> 06:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
charged with evaluating what goes on in
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
those courts those transcripts were not
 
06:25:11.910 --> 06:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
written by court reporters because
 
06:25:15.990 --> 06:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
several years ago the courts generally
 
06:25:19.190 --> 06:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
acted to remove court reporters and
 
06:25:23.910 --> 06:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
instead to use um recording devices
 
06:25:26.948 --> 06:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
which someone or other was responsible
 
06:25:30.510 --> 06:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
for turning on at the start and one
 
06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
hopes turning off at the end of a court
 
06:25:37.190 --> 06:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
day sometimes that works sometimes that
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't but that's the Court's problem
 
06:25:41.390 --> 06:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
the court has to make those decisions
 
06:25:44.510 --> 06:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
for themselves however court reporters
 
06:25:47.788 --> 06:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
have a lot of other
 
06:25:51.110 --> 06:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and they are trained
 
06:25:55.868 --> 06:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
they are uh evaluated they are
 
06:25:58.750 --> 06:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
licensed um they have continuing
 
06:25:58.760 --> 06:26:00.230 align:start position:0%
licensed um they have continuing
education

06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:26:03.788 --> 06:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
requirements they um take depositions
 
06:26:06.868 --> 06:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
for legal proceedings they do all kinds
 
06:26:10.110 --> 06:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
of things that determine in fact at the
 
06:26:13.670 --> 06:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
end the quality of the judicial
 
06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
process um and it is because of that
 
06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the committee um uh that half of
 
06:26:24.310 --> 06:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
the committee it was 1010 believe that
 
06:26:29.390 --> 06:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
in fact court reporters do continue to
 
06:26:32.430 --> 06:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
provide uh an important function with
 
06:26:32.440 --> 06:26:33.310 align:start position:0%
provide uh an important function with
high

06:26:33.310 --> 06:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
high
 
06:26:37.030 --> 06:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
standards and uh and it was something
 
06:26:39.430 --> 06:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
that we ought to protect not for
 
06:26:41.390 --> 06:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
particularly for our benefit but for the
 
06:26:44.350 --> 06:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of the citizens who are in
 
06:26:47.830 --> 06:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
situations that involve the need for an
 
06:26:51.430 --> 06:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
accurate record of what is going on
 
06:26:55.670 --> 06:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
therefore we would ask that you um
 
06:26:58.830 --> 06:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
vote uh
 
06:27:03.390 --> 06:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
against uh uh the bill which would mean
 
06:27:06.590 --> 06:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl motion that was
 
06:27:10.590 --> 06:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
supported by 10 of the committee members
 
06:27:12.750 --> 06:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
um and hope you will do that in the best
 
06:27:15.590 --> 06:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
interest of the quality of the work we
 
06:27:17.670 --> 06:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
need from people who carry out this
 
06:27:21.310 --> 06:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
essential function thank
 
06:27:23.788 --> 06:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Linds recognized to
 
06:27:29.310 --> 06:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:30.670 --> 06:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:27:33.190 --> 06:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker when this bill was
 
06:27:36.468 --> 06:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
first in committee our speaker ameritus
 
06:27:39.150 --> 06:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
from conquer a person who I have known
 
06:27:41.708 --> 06:27:41.718 align:start position:0%
and greatly respected for more than 40
 
06:27:45.390 --> 06:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
years testified against the bill he
 
06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
related the great respect he had for
 
06:27:50.628 --> 06:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
court reporters based on his observe his
 
06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
experience observing them in court when
 
06:27:54.750 --> 06:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
he was with the United States Marshal's
 
06:27:54.760 --> 06:27:55.990 align:start position:0%
he was with the United States Marshal's
office

06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
06:27:58.670 --> 06:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
and he said ending State regulation of
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
them would threaten the accuracy and
 
06:28:03.628 --> 06:28:03.638 align:start position:0%
integrity of Cru of crucially important
 
06:28:03.638 --> 06:28:04.788 align:start position:0%
integrity of Cru of crucially important
court

06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:28:08.750 --> 06:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
records 20 years ago I could not have
 
06:28:11.708 --> 06:28:11.718 align:start position:0%
agreed more strongly with the views he
 
06:28:14.628 --> 06:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
expressed at that time the Superior
 
06:28:17.548 --> 06:28:17.558 align:start position:0%
Court where I was a judge exclusively
 
06:28:19.830 --> 06:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
used court reporters to make the
 
06:28:22.350 --> 06:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
verbatim stenographic records of Trials
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
and hearings but at about that time
 
06:28:29.830 --> 06:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
time as a moneysaving move the Supreme
 
06:28:31.868 --> 06:28:31.878 align:start position:0%
Court decided to terminate the court
 
06:28:34.430 --> 06:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
reporters and replace them with a tape
 
06:28:37.030 --> 06:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
recording system that would record all
 
06:28:39.750 --> 06:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings and would be operated by a
 
06:28:42.628 --> 06:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
by a much lower paid person called a
 
06:28:45.150 --> 06:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
monitor whose job would be to make sure
 
06:28:46.990 --> 06:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
that recording devices were working
 
06:28:49.230 --> 06:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
properly and to collect and marked
 
06:28:52.910 --> 06:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
exhibits Etc most of us judges on the
 
06:28:55.350 --> 06:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
superior court at this time my self
 
06:28:57.990 --> 06:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
included were strongly opposed to
 
06:29:00.390 --> 06:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
terminating the court reporters because
 
06:29:02.628 --> 06:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
just like the speaker ameritus We
 
06:29:05.230 --> 06:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
Believe doing so would be a disaster in
 
06:29:07.868 --> 06:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
terms of the accuracy and integrity of
 
06:29:10.350 --> 06:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
the record of Court proceedings and
 
06:29:13.390 --> 06:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
candidly beyond our professional
 
06:29:16.230 --> 06:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
concerns we trial judges had great
 
06:29:18.270 --> 06:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
affection for our court reporters they
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
were part of our court family and we
 
06:29:22.390 --> 06:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
didn't want to see them
 
06:29:25.390 --> 06:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
terminated the whole thing got very very
 
06:29:28.990 --> 06:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
ugly the court reporters unionized they
 
06:29:31.868 --> 06:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
filed a lawsuit trying to prevent their
 
06:29:34.548 --> 06:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
discharge the case went to the Supreme
 
06:29:37.628 --> 06:29:37.638 align:start position:0%
Court where most of the judges recused
 
06:29:40.110 --> 06:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
themselves and a number of retired
 
06:29:42.310 --> 06:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judges were substituted
 
06:29:46.030 --> 06:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
in their place and eventually in a 3 to2
 
06:29:48.190 --> 06:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
decision the court upheld the
 
06:29:51.030 --> 06:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
termination of the court
 
06:29:54.430 --> 06:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
reporters but as it turned out I was
 
06:29:54.440 --> 06:29:55.830 align:start position:0%
reporters but as it turned out I was
wrong

06:29:55.830 --> 06:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
06:29:58.310 --> 06:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
over the past 20 years the tape
 
06:30:00.230 --> 06:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
recording system implemented by the
 
06:30:03.350 --> 06:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has worked just fine have
 
06:30:06.110 --> 06:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
there been a few problems occasionally
 
06:30:08.110 --> 06:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
from time to time yes but there were a
 
06:30:11.590 --> 06:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
few problems with the court
 
06:30:14.990 --> 06:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
reporters and it did save the the state
 
06:30:17.628 --> 06:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
a great deal of money the recording
 
06:30:20.430 --> 06:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
devices work well and when a transcript
 
06:30:22.310 --> 06:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
is needed the court system uses an
 
06:30:24.788 --> 06:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
outfit in Arizona to which the record
 
06:30:27.548 --> 06:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
boings have been sent for years to uh
 
06:30:30.110 --> 06:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
prepare the the written transcripts the
 
06:30:32.390 --> 06:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
point of all this is that although they
 
06:30:35.390 --> 06:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
are still called court reporters they
 
06:30:37.310 --> 06:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
could more accurately be called
 
06:30:39.910 --> 06:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
non-court reporters because they no
 
06:30:41.788 --> 06:30:41.798 align:start position:0%
longer are used in the state court
 
06:30:44.350 --> 06:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
system their work today consists mostly
 
06:30:47.190 --> 06:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
of making a stenographic record of of
 
06:30:49.388 --> 06:30:49.398 align:start position:0%
depositions and other outof court
 
06:30:51.548 --> 06:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
proceedings where a Verbatim record is
 
06:30:55.270 --> 06:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
needed the arguments offered now for why
 
06:30:57.270 --> 06:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
court reporters should be regulated by
 
06:30:59.670 --> 06:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
the state the need to ensure accuracy
 
06:31:02.070 --> 06:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
and integrity of the testimonial record
 
06:31:04.708 --> 06:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
are exactly the same arguments that were
 
06:31:07.628 --> 06:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
made 20 years ago for not terminating
 
06:31:09.190 --> 06:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
their positions in the
 
06:31:12.030 --> 06:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
court those arguments were turned out to
 
06:31:15.670 --> 06:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
be wrong then and they are wrong now
 
06:31:18.388 --> 06:31:18.398 align:start position:0%
State regulation of court reporters is
 
06:31:21.070 --> 06:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in the 17 years that the
 
06:31:23.070 --> 06:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
court licensing system has been in
 
06:31:25.270 --> 06:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
effect there has never been an
 
06:31:28.070 --> 06:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement or disciplinary proceeding
 
06:31:30.628 --> 06:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
involving a court reporter the current
 
06:31:33.590 --> 06:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
scheme requires court reporters to be
 
06:31:36.030 --> 06:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
licensed which in turn requires that
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
they hold certification from one of the
 
06:31:41.628 --> 06:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
two national cred credentialing bodies
 
06:31:43.190 --> 06:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that they comply with a code of
 
06:31:45.388 --> 06:31:45.398 align:start position:0%
ethics and continuing education
 
06:31:48.110 --> 06:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
requirement issued by these bodies
 
06:31:50.590 --> 06:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
lenses must be renewed every two uh
 
06:31:52.388 --> 06:31:52.398 align:start position:0%
every licenses must be renewed every two
 
06:31:54.990 --> 06:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
years and court reporters also must be
 
06:31:56.948 --> 06:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
bonded in the amount of
 
06:31:59.868 --> 06:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
$1,000 all of these requirements have
 
06:32:03.190 --> 06:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
costs and fees associated with them
 
06:32:06.990 --> 06:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
please understand as proponents of
 
06:32:09.670 --> 06:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
deregulation we do not suggest that
 
06:32:11.788 --> 06:32:11.798 align:start position:0%
credentialing by the national
 
06:32:15.190 --> 06:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
associations or continuing education or
 
06:32:18.548 --> 06:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
bonding are bad things we simply say
 
06:32:20.830 --> 06:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
that there is no reason for the state to
 
06:32:23.830 --> 06:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
be involved in any of this the people
 
06:32:25.708 --> 06:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
who use cour court reporters are a
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
sophisticated group they are mostly
 
06:32:31.430 --> 06:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys or other professionals if they
 
06:32:33.230 --> 06:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
want a court reporter who has the
 
06:32:35.948 --> 06:32:35.958 align:start position:0%
national credential or the continuing
 
06:32:38.830 --> 06:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
education or the bonding they can make
 
06:32:41.868 --> 06:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
any or all of these things uh conditions
 
06:32:43.590 --> 06:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
of hiring the court reporter for a
 
06:32:46.548 --> 06:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
particular job in short this is
 
06:32:48.830 --> 06:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
something that the marketplace can
 
06:32:52.110 --> 06:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
handle the only real effect of Licensing
 
06:32:55.230 --> 06:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
is to limit competition in this field
 
06:32:57.830 --> 06:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
under the law no one can engage in
 
06:33:00.030 --> 06:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
stenographic or a similar type of court
 
06:33:02.750 --> 06:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
reporting without a license to do so is
 
06:33:05.948 --> 06:33:05.958 align:start position:0%
a crime the license is timec consuming
 
06:33:08.590 --> 06:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
and relatively expensive to obtain
 
06:33:10.990 --> 06:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
moreover although the need for a license
 
06:33:13.310 --> 06:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
technically does not apply to someone
 
06:33:15.510 --> 06:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
who may desire to use a tape recorder to
 
06:33:17.628 --> 06:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
make and preserve the record the
 
06:33:20.310 --> 06:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
statutory prohibition against using
 
06:33:24.590 --> 06:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
these terms quote court reporter Court

06:33:33.510 --> 06:33:33.520 align:start position:0%

06:33:35.948 --> 06:33:35.958 align:start position:0%
someone Desiring to use this method to
 
06:33:38.270 --> 06:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
advertise the availability of their
 
06:33:41.070 --> 06:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
services in a meaningful way to those
 
06:33:43.350 --> 06:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
who might be interested in the uh in
 
06:33:43.360 --> 06:33:44.670 align:start position:0%
who might be interested in the uh in

06:33:47.030 --> 06:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
them there are not me there are not a
 
06:33:49.310 --> 06:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
great many licensed court reporters and
 
06:33:51.708 --> 06:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
the cost of this regulatory scheme in
 
06:33:54.628 --> 06:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
the overall Universe of State regulation
 
06:33:56.070 --> 06:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
is relatively
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
small but the principle at stake here is
 
06:34:02.788 --> 06:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
an important one the question you must
 
06:34:06.190 --> 06:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
decide by your vote is this does this
 
06:34:08.830 --> 06:34:08.840 align:start position:0%

will to reduce the size of government
 
06:34:16.948 --> 06:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
just a little bit to take a baby step to
 
06:34:19.590 --> 06:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the state's regulatory footprint
 
06:34:22.628 --> 06:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
and enhance economic freedom in an area
 
06:34:24.708 --> 06:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
where Public Safety and Health are not
 
06:34:27.510 --> 06:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
at all implicated I submit to you

remove the votes from being printed on
 
06:47:01.070 --> 06:47:01.080 align:start position:0%

06:48:15.830 --> 06:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
I ask for a division vote thank you
 
06:48:17.388 --> 06:48:17.398 align:start position:0%
representative Richard Browns recognized
 
06:48:20.948 --> 06:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:23.670 --> 06:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker thank you
 
06:48:26.030 --> 06:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
fellow Representatives many voters who
 
06:48:27.628 --> 06:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
attend Town meetings do not have the
 
06:48:29.230 --> 06:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
ability to attend governing body
 
06:48:31.310 --> 06:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
meetings or the time to review those
 
06:48:34.070 --> 06:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
meetings online but do want to know how
 
06:48:36.388 --> 06:48:36.398 align:start position:0%
their members voted after all they voted
 
06:48:38.468 --> 06:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
for them to be the community to do the
 
06:48:41.030 --> 06:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
community work and want to know how they
 
06:48:44.070 --> 06:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
voted on important issues in many cases
 
06:48:46.628 --> 06:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
I feel the officials have expertise and
 
06:48:48.670 --> 06:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
time to investigate these matters that
 
06:48:51.388 --> 06:48:51.398 align:start position:0%
they can't and in most instances people
 
06:48:54.270 --> 06:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
trust them but also want to confirm that
 
06:48:56.590 --> 06:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
their officials are accountable to
 
06:48:58.910 --> 06:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
them when the members vote tally is
 
06:49:01.310 --> 06:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
shown along with the warrant articles
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
people can see several things for
 
06:49:06.548 --> 06:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
instance if it's a 4 to zero vote it
 
06:49:08.110 --> 06:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
could give voters confidence in the
 
06:49:11.030 --> 06:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
article's validity if it's a split vote
 
06:49:13.910 --> 06:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
2 two for instance it would likely bring
 
06:49:18.190 --> 06:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
people to question it if it's 0 to four
 
06:49:20.868 --> 06:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
it would likely be a serious consider
 
06:49:23.230 --> 06:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
consideration for them to examine and in
 
06:49:25.270 --> 06:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
any case it gives people additional
 
06:49:28.948 --> 06:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
information a more informed vote from my
 
06:49:30.670 --> 06:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
experience it also typically prompts
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
questions from
 
06:49:35.948 --> 06:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
voters who voted which way and why is
 
06:49:38.270 --> 06:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
what they want to know in the house we
 
06:49:40.750 --> 06:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
have a majority and minority reports we
 
06:49:42.910 --> 06:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
also have white sheets gold sheets pink
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
sheets and whatever information people
 
06:49:47.510 --> 06:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
hand to us as we enter the house I
 
06:49:49.190 --> 06:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
always look at the majority and minority

Amendment today to correct a drafting
 
07:00:07.510 --> 07:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
error in the original it simply deletes
 
07:00:09.948 --> 07:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
wording in a previous amendment that
 
07:00:12.190 --> 07:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
restricted public participation in
 
07:00:14.510 --> 07:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
County Commission meetings to comment
 
07:00:17.910 --> 07:00:17.920 align:start position:0%

Amendment before you today removes a
 
07:00:22.510 --> 07:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
sentence that prohibited County
 
07:00:24.628 --> 07:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
residents from asking questions during
 
07:00:27.150 --> 07:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
the meeting and the members of Municipal
 
07:00:29.510 --> 07:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
and County government view the ability
 
07:00:31.510 --> 07:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
to ask questions as vital to the
 
07:00:34.110 --> 07:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
openness and accountability called for
 
07:00:35.628 --> 07:00:35.638 align:start position:0%

sentence be removed this amendment
 
07:00:43.628 --> 07:00:43.638 align:start position:0%

Municipal and County government to which

07:01:34.270 --> 07:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the establishment of

report thank you Mr Speaker and
honorable

07:02:07.948 --> 07:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
07:02:10.948 --> 07:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
Representatives hb1 1242 is all about
 
07:02:13.030 --> 07:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
governmental efficiency in establishing
 
07:02:15.388 --> 07:02:15.398 align:start position:0%
Communications districts so we can best
 
07:02:17.750 --> 07:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
use the unprecedented Broadband funding
 
07:02:20.070 --> 07:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
being made available by the Biden
 
07:02:22.070 --> 07:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
Administration our state's rural
 
07:02:23.910 --> 07:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
communities have struggled to access
 
07:02:26.868 --> 07:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
this great program that started in 2020
 
07:02:28.310 --> 07:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
with only a couple districts being
 
07:02:30.910 --> 07:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
formed since despite the con
 
07:02:32.628 --> 07:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
connectivity issues our rural
 
07:02:35.430 --> 07:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
communities continue to face the major
 
07:02:36.990 --> 07:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
problem is with how we currently
 
07:02:38.788 --> 07:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
establish districts because it is
 
07:02:41.750 --> 07:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
individuals towns starting this process
 
07:02:44.388 --> 07:02:44.398 align:start position:0%
but the economies of scale work better
 
07:02:45.910 --> 07:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
at the county
 
07:02:48.628 --> 07:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
level Communications districts are not
 
07:02:51.948 --> 07:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
tax funded but are funded by subscribers
 
07:02:54.070 --> 07:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
and ensuring a large enough subscriber
 
07:02:56.830 --> 07:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
base means operating at a county
 
07:02:59.310 --> 07:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
level that is why one of the few
 
07:03:00.830 --> 07:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
districts in the whole state is the
 
07:03:03.468 --> 07:03:03.478 align:start position:0%
Carroll County communications District
 
07:03:05.110 --> 07:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
because it is operating at an
 
07:03:07.910 --> 07:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate scale despite the tedious
 
07:03:09.868 --> 07:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
and difficult establishment
 
07:03:12.150 --> 07:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
process opponents of this bill have
 
07:03:14.190 --> 07:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
claimed that counties already have this
 
07:03:17.030 --> 07:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
power which is false because the bill
 
07:03:22.670 --> 07:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
explicitly refers to RSA 21 uh 47 and 48
 
07:03:24.910 --> 07:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
which explicitly only gives County
 
07:03:26.788 --> 07:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
governments uh the power over
 
07:03:30.310 --> 07:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns and not the whole
 
07:03:33.788 --> 07:03:33.798 align:start position:0%
County this is only enabling legislation
 
07:03:35.708 --> 07:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
meaning that counties are not forced to
 
07:03:38.750 --> 07:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
create a Communications District but if
 
07:03:41.070 --> 07:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
they do municipalities still have the
 
07:03:44.110 --> 07:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
option to opt out the association of
 
07:03:46.910 --> 07:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
counties is in unanimous support of this
 
07:03:49.310 --> 07:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and I will hope you will
 
07:03:52.430 --> 07:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
join me in helping our rural communities
 
07:03:54.910 --> 07:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
and North Country have quality internet
 
07:03:57.070 --> 07:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
access by streamlining this existing
 
07:03:59.708 --> 07:03:59.718 align:start position:0%
statute thank
 
07:04:02.230 --> 07:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
you representative McDonald's recognized
 
07:04:06.830 --> 07:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:10.230 --> 07:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
report thank you uh Mr Speaker uh hb1
 
07:04:12.590 --> 07:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
1242 is the establishment of countywide
 
07:04:15.468 --> 07:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
communication districts this bill if
 
07:04:17.990 --> 07:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
passed with allow of County Wide
 
07:04:20.510 --> 07:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
Community District districts but it's
 
07:04:21.868 --> 07:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
going to do it's going to demand and
 
07:04:24.510 --> 07:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
involuntary require all the communities
 
07:04:27.270 --> 07:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
within that County to join that District
 
07:04:29.030 --> 07:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
they will have the option to op out but
 
07:04:30.788 --> 07:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
they still have to do that on their
 
07:04:33.750 --> 07:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
own the governing body of
 
07:04:36.830 --> 07:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
municipality would would be taxed with
 
07:04:39.628 --> 07:04:39.638 align:start position:0%
taking the extra step to change and get
 
07:04:42.548 --> 07:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
out of the uh the county agreement uh
 
07:04:43.708 --> 07:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee believes
 
07:04:46.030 --> 07:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary as current law
 
07:04:48.310 --> 07:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
allows two or more municipalities to
 
07:04:51.150 --> 07:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
create a communication District a prime
 
07:04:53.708 --> 07:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
example of is a c County communication
 
07:04:55.948 --> 07:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
District in which 16 towns have come
 
07:04:58.628 --> 07:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
together to create the district it is
 
07:05:01.548 --> 07:05:01.558 align:start position:0%
working both effectively fairly and
 
07:05:04.030 --> 07:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
evenly for all its members I urge you to
 
07:05:06.110 --> 07:05:06.120 align:start position:0%

in a County already have the ability to
 
07:07:52.310 --> 07:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
create Communications District
 
07:07:53.990 --> 07:07:54.000 align:start position:0%

developed their own specific zoning

regulations over many decades to suit
 
07:12:27.708 --> 07:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
each municipality's needs and if I also
 
07:12:29.788 --> 07:12:29.798 align:start position:0%
know this legislation would completely
 
07:12:32.270 --> 07:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
negate and upend those Decades of zoning
 
07:12:34.788 --> 07:12:34.798 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
07:12:58.150 --> 07:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
if I know that New Hampshire is
 
07:13:00.190 --> 07:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
currently in the midst of a housing
 
07:13:02.788 --> 07:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
crisis where the median down payment of
 
07:13:05.150 --> 07:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
20% to buy a single family home in the
 
07:13:06.590 --> 07:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
granite state is
 
07:13:10.670 --> 07:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
$71,500 according to bankrate.com and if
 
07:13:12.830 --> 07:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
I further know that we are struggling
 
07:13:16.030 --> 07:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
under the burden of 50 years of nimi
 
07:13:18.510 --> 07:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
local ordinances many designed with the
 
07:13:21.388 --> 07:13:21.398 align:start position:0%
intent to keep out new home buyers and
 
07:13:23.708 --> 07:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
block residential development and if I
 
07:13:25.388 --> 07:13:25.398 align:start position:0%
know that according to the marcata
 
07:13:28.388 --> 07:13:28.398 align:start position:0%
center at George Mason University quote
 
07:13:31.110 --> 07:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire only permits about three
 
07:13:34.708 --> 07:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
new dwellings per year per 1,000
 
07:13:38.708 --> 07:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
residents further quote local authority
 
07:13:41.548 --> 07:13:41.558 align:start position:0%
to regulate housing density is based on
 
07:13:44.110 --> 07:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
the state granted power to protect the
 
07:13:46.468 --> 07:13:46.478 align:start position:0%
health and safety of residents but
 
07:13:48.910 --> 07:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
localities in New Hampshire have imposed
 
07:13:51.230 --> 07:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions on new development that go
 
07:13:53.750 --> 07:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
far beyond these well-defined concerns
 
07:13:55.270 --> 07:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
and have left the market unable to
 
07:13:57.030 --> 07:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
respond to a growing housing shortage
 
07:13:58.788 --> 07:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
end quote and
 
07:14:02.910 --> 07:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
finally be in order finally if I know
 
07:14:05.230 --> 07:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
that starting over with a blank slate to
 
07:14:07.910 --> 07:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
rewrite our zoning regulations is
 
07:14:10.510 --> 07:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what we need to address runaway
 
07:14:12.990 --> 07:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
rents and affordability for firsttime
 
07:14:15.948 --> 07:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
home buyers to rewrite new rules for our
 
07:14:18.430 --> 07:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
rigged game of Monopoly our
 
07:14:20.430 --> 07:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities have created through 50
 
07:14:22.868 --> 07:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
years of zoning ordinance overreach
 
07:14:25.708 --> 07:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
would I then press the red button and
 
07:14:27.830 --> 07:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
instead support a vote for new rules for
 
07:14:29.388 --> 07:14:29.398 align:start position:0%
new housing on behalf of future
 
07:14:31.910 --> 07:14:31.920 align:start position:0%

motion thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
07:17:30.110 --> 07:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
support of the floor amendment to House
 
07:17:30.120 --> 07:17:31.468 align:start position:0%
support of the floor amendment to House
Bill

07:17:31.468 --> 07:17:31.478 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
07:17:34.590 --> 07:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
1359 this floor Amendment simply adds
 
07:17:36.830 --> 07:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
language that would allow a property
 
07:17:40.150 --> 07:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
owner in a municipality who is directly
 
07:17:42.350 --> 07:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
affected by a decision of the board of
 
07:17:45.750 --> 07:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment to be able to file an appeal
 
07:17:48.910 --> 07:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
at the local level this amendment is
 
07:17:51.468 --> 07:17:51.478 align:start position:0%
important because the bill as written
 
07:17:54.670 --> 07:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
goes too far and is overly
 
07:17:57.190 --> 07:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
restrictive Mr Speaker it is important
 
07:17:59.628 --> 07:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
to understand that a property owner can
 
07:18:02.628 --> 07:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
in fact be affected by a zoning Board of

in a butter as defined in statute we
 
07:18:11.590 --> 07:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
know that most towns in New Hampshire
 
07:18:16.070 --> 07:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
are entirely on private Wells and septic
 
07:18:19.350 --> 07:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
consider for example a large subdivision
 
07:18:22.468 --> 07:18:22.478 align:start position:0%
that is granted a density waiver by a
 
07:18:25.990 --> 07:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
zba and keep in mind that only abutters
 
07:18:28.788 --> 07:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
are notified when the zba cases are
 
07:18:32.350 --> 07:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
heard in this example without this floor
 
07:18:35.270 --> 07:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment a directly affected non-ab
 
07:18:38.350 --> 07:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
budding property owner with demonstrable
 
07:18:41.190 --> 07:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
evidence that the density waiver would
 
07:18:45.150 --> 07:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the shared aquafer
 
07:18:47.270 --> 07:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed to file an appeal
 
07:18:49.868 --> 07:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
at the local level however with this
 
07:18:52.670 --> 07:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment a directly affected
 
07:18:55.990 --> 07:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
property owner in the municipality can
 
07:18:59.468 --> 07:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
file an appeal at the local level within
 
07:19:03.548 --> 07:19:03.558 align:start position:0%
30 days since the zba must hold the
 
07:19:06.910 --> 07:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
rehearing within 30 days to consider the
 
07:19:10.750 --> 07:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
new information the maximum delay is 60
 
07:19:15.150 --> 07:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
days and often much less to be clear
 
07:19:19.990 --> 07:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1359 as written denies a non
 
07:19:22.948 --> 07:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
abing property owner who was directly
 
07:19:25.868 --> 07:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
affected by a board decision of their
 
07:19:29.750 --> 07:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
due process rights for an appeal at the
 
07:19:33.868 --> 07:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
local level this leaves as the only
 
07:19:37.310 --> 07:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
recourse a prolonged court case in
 
07:19:40.990 --> 07:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Court which will undoubtedly
 
07:19:44.670 --> 07:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
result in Greater delays for any project
 
07:19:48.190 --> 07:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
and increased expense for all parties
 
07:19:50.910 --> 07:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
involved including effective Property
 
07:19:54.310 --> 07:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
Owners the developer the municipality
 
07:19:56.270 --> 07:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
and ultimately the
 
07:19:59.788 --> 07:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Mr Speaker this amendment this
 
07:20:01.948 --> 07:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
floor amendment is a common sense
 
07:20:04.750 --> 07:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
provision that will protect the rights
 
07:20:07.548 --> 07:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
of local property owners and give them a
 
07:20:10.548 --> 07:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
voice for a rapid resolution at the
 
07:20:14.430 --> 07:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
local level therefore I urge my fellow
 
07:20:17.070 --> 07:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote Yes to support this
 
07:20:19.788 --> 07:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment and then the bill as
 
07:20:19.798 --> 07:20:21.030 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment and then the bill as
amended

07:20:21.030 --> 07:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
amended
 
07:20:23.670 --> 07:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
07:20:26.310 --> 07:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative maor's recognized
 
07:20:29.110 --> 07:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:31.670 --> 07:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
07:20:34.070 --> 07:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker I arise in opposition to the
 
07:20:36.070 --> 07:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment adopting this floor
 
07:20:37.830 --> 07:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment would defeat the purpose of
 
07:20:41.708 --> 07:20:41.718 align:start position:0%
the important underlying Bill HB 1359 as
 
07:20:43.350 --> 07:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
it has been brought to us today will be
 
07:20:45.868 --> 07:20:45.878 align:start position:0%
a major step forward in facilitating the
 
07:20:49.270 --> 07:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
housing um our state critically needs HB
 
07:20:49.280 --> 07:20:50.868 align:start position:0%
housing um our state critically needs HB
1359

07:20:50.868 --> 07:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
1359
 
07:20:53.628 --> 07:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
changes the wording currently in statute
 
07:20:56.310 --> 07:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
which is highly subjective to a more
 
07:20:58.548 --> 07:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
relevant understandable definition of
 
07:21:00.948 --> 07:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a butter when
 
07:21:03.070 --> 07:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
developers go before zoning and planning
 
07:21:05.030 --> 07:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
boards they are now open to time
 
07:21:08.670 --> 07:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
consuming and costly appeals from any
 
07:21:11.590 --> 07:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
person aggrieved as stated in current
 
07:21:13.388 --> 07:21:13.398 align:start position:0%
law I think you will agree Mr Speaker
 
07:21:17.270 --> 07:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
and colleagues that this could mean
 
07:21:20.230 --> 07:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
anyone and frequently it does making
 
07:21:22.270 --> 07:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
proceeding the with building projects
 
07:21:24.868 --> 07:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
much more costly and in many cases
 
07:21:27.510 --> 07:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible this amendment tries
 
07:21:29.270 --> 07:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
to deal with the problem of changing the
 
07:21:31.910 --> 07:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
language to any property owner in the
 
07:21:34.350 --> 07:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
municipality directly
 
07:21:36.468 --> 07:21:36.478 align:start position:0%
affected but the current statute's
 
07:21:38.030 --> 07:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
language is also vague and can be
 
07:21:41.670 --> 07:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
interpreted in any number of ways what
 
07:21:44.788 --> 07:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
would directly affected mean could it
 
07:21:48.110 --> 07:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
mean someone 10 miles away whose morning
 
07:21:51.468 --> 07:21:51.478 align:start position:0%
drive would um would have them go one
 
07:21:55.230 --> 07:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
more stop or pass by the the site could
 
07:21:57.670 --> 07:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
it be someone 15 miles away who has a
 
07:21:59.948 --> 07:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion with the applicant
 
07:22:01.830 --> 07:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the
 
07:22:04.350 --> 07:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
application and should the application
 
07:22:07.750 --> 07:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
affect an aquifer Dees points out
 
07:22:11.270 --> 07:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
statutes which clearly give the Pu
 
07:22:13.510 --> 07:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
authority to overrule any local
 
07:22:15.350 --> 07:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
regulation that would prevent Community
 
07:22:18.110 --> 07:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
Water Systems from being squarely
 
07:22:22.468 --> 07:22:22.478 align:start position:0%
regulated by the state uh excuse me um
 
07:22:24.430 --> 07:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
would get that would um prevent
 
07:22:25.948 --> 07:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
Community Water Systems from being
 
07:22:28.310 --> 07:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
squarely regulated by the state alone if
 
07:22:30.708 --> 07:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
necessary that provision has never been
 
07:22:32.990 --> 07:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
used but it does exist so the aquit
 
07:22:36.468 --> 07:22:36.478 align:start position:0%
question is a state question not a local
 
07:22:38.708 --> 07:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
question clearly this amendment runs
 
07:22:40.910 --> 07:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
counter to the spirit and intent of
 
07:22:43.670 --> 07:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
1359 it further muddies Waters that are
 
07:22:46.350 --> 07:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
already murky at best I urge you to
 
07:22:48.750 --> 07:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
defeat this amendment so we can move on
 
07:22:51.430 --> 07:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
to pass this leg important legislation
 
07:22:52.590 --> 07:22:52.600 align:start position:0%

07:26:50.510 --> 07:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's important to understand exactly
 
07:26:52.190 --> 07:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
what a zoning board of appeals does and
 
07:26:54.070 --> 07:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
what a planning board does a lot of
 
07:26:55.388 --> 07:26:55.398 align:start position:0%
people think that the zoning board
 
07:26:57.350 --> 07:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
writes the zoning code that's incorrect
 
07:26:59.110 --> 07:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
the planning board
 
07:27:01.670 --> 07:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
does what about
 
07:27:01.680 --> 07:27:03.910 align:start position:0%
does what about
it

07:27:03.910 --> 07:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:27:06.270 --> 07:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
okay it's important to understand what a
 
07:27:08.110 --> 07:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
zoning board does a lot of people uh
 
07:27:09.510 --> 07:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
mistakenly think that it writes the
 
07:27:11.110 --> 07:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
zoning code it does not that's the
 
07:27:12.948 --> 07:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
planning board the zoning board of
 
07:27:15.750 --> 07:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
appeals has two purposes one is to Grant
 
07:27:17.628 --> 07:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
variances from the zoning code where
 
07:27:19.350 --> 07:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
Justice and strict application of the
 
07:27:21.948 --> 07:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
letter of the law would not uh uh do
 
07:27:24.830 --> 07:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
justice but the other thing is to serve
 
07:27:28.548 --> 07:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh as due process or to hear citizens uh
 
07:27:30.830 --> 07:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
protesting uh when the government has
 
07:27:33.070 --> 07:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
not behaved correctly or fairly I'll
 
07:27:35.388 --> 07:27:35.398 align:start position:0%
give you one particular example uh 6
 
07:27:36.990 --> 07:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
years ago and there was earlier talk
 
07:27:38.910 --> 07:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
about how long when you don't have an
 
07:27:41.750 --> 07:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
appeal process court cases can go six
 
07:27:44.110 --> 07:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
years ago I live in a residential and
 
07:27:46.070 --> 07:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
agricultural District my nextd door
 
07:27:48.948 --> 07:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
neighbor wanted to build a 26ft tall
 
07:27:51.708 --> 07:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
industrial building building of 4,800 ft
 
07:27:53.270 --> 07:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that he could run a body shop in it
 
07:27:55.430 --> 07:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
in a residential area he went to the
 
07:27:56.948 --> 07:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
building inspector the building
 
07:27:59.388 --> 07:27:59.398 align:start position:0%
inspector has zero training in zoning
 
07:28:01.430 --> 07:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
code or law he has training in building
 
07:28:02.468 --> 07:28:02.478 align:start position:0%
inspection and that's good and
 
07:28:05.350 --> 07:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable but it is his job to rubber
 
07:28:08.590 --> 07:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
stamp or to stamp applications he said
 
07:28:11.670 --> 07:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
yes you can absolutely put a 4,800 ft
 
07:28:14.468 --> 07:28:14.478 align:start position:0%
bodyy shop in a residential Zone in the
 
07:28:17.910 --> 07:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
front setback and in the side setback a
 
07:28:19.830 --> 07:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
lot of neighbors were outraged by this
 
07:28:21.308 --> 07:28:21.318 align:start position:0%
and we went to the zoning board of
 
07:28:23.830 --> 07:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
appeals and that's another story and
 
07:28:26.628 --> 07:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
I'll write a book on it someday um but
 
07:28:29.430 --> 07:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
what happened is you've got a unelected
 
07:28:31.308 --> 07:28:31.318 align:start position:0%
uh government employee who made a
 
07:28:33.708 --> 07:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
decision that impacted other people to
 
07:28:35.308 --> 07:28:35.318 align:start position:0%
the tune of hundreds of thousands of
 
07:28:37.708 --> 07:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
dollars this and and at least the law
 
07:28:39.590 --> 07:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
today says that we have an appeal we
 
07:28:41.308 --> 07:28:41.318 align:start position:0%
have a right to petition our government
 
07:28:44.430 --> 07:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
for redress of grievances and we did
 
07:28:46.830 --> 07:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would say everyone up and down
 
07:28:49.350 --> 07:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
this road who is losing 50 to $100,000
 
07:28:51.590 --> 07:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
of property value unless they are
 
07:28:53.830 --> 07:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
exactly next door or exactly across the
 
07:28:56.910 --> 07:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
street has no ability to petition the
 
07:28:58.708 --> 07:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
government there is even a hack here
 
07:28:59.910 --> 07:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
that one of my lawyer friends pointed
 
07:29:02.230 --> 07:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
out if a developer wanted to do
 
07:29:04.388 --> 07:29:04.398 align:start position:0%
something underhanded um that would
 
07:29:06.990 --> 07:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
drastically impact locals he could buy a
 
07:29:09.430 --> 07:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
large piece of property subdivide it so
 
07:29:11.830 --> 07:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
that he became his own abutter and there
 
07:29:14.270 --> 07:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
were no other abuts and then no one else
 
07:29:16.190 --> 07:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to petition the
 
07:29:18.590 --> 07:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
government for redress of grievances if
 
07:29:20.430 --> 07:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
the building inspector who again is not
 
07:29:23.030 --> 07:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
trained in zoning gave him an illegal
 
07:29:25.868 --> 07:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
building permit the goal of creating
 
07:29:27.548 --> 07:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
more housing for New Hampshire families
 
07:29:30.230 --> 07:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
is a good one I'm very open-minded to it
 
07:29:32.388 --> 07:29:32.398 align:start position:0%
but this is a quick and dirty hack
 
07:29:34.430 --> 07:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
saying government officials should be
 
07:29:36.388 --> 07:29:36.398 align:start position:0%
allowed to break the law and citizens
 
07:29:37.788 --> 07:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed to complain about
 
07:29:39.628 --> 07:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
it so I
 
07:29:42.468 --> 07:29:42.478 align:start position:0%
vote against the OTP and I encourage you
 
07:29:45.030 --> 07:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
to as well thank
 
07:29:47.670 --> 07:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
you representative lels is recognized
 
07:30:02.388 --> 07:30:02.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:06.070 --> 07:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
07:30:09.788 --> 07:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
colleagues all this business about a
 
07:30:13.430 --> 07:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
Butters comes down to
 
07:30:15.548 --> 07:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
definitions who's in the
 
07:30:18.430 --> 07:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
butter who's an AG grieved
 
07:30:18.440 --> 07:30:21.150 align:start position:0%
butter who's an AG grieved
party

07:30:21.150 --> 07:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
party
 
07:30:24.510 --> 07:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
who is directly affected and who is not
 
07:30:24.520 --> 07:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
who is directly affected and who is not
directly

07:30:27.110 --> 07:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
directly
 
07:30:29.230 --> 07:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
affected if you
 
07:30:31.948 --> 07:30:31.958 align:start position:0%
have such an
 
07:30:35.430 --> 07:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
expansive definition of a butter you
 
07:30:37.708 --> 07:30:37.718 align:start position:0%
could have somebody in
 
07:30:40.190 --> 07:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
California dragging
 
07:30:44.230 --> 07:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
out a development that's much
 
07:30:48.350 --> 07:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
needed if you have a very restrictive
 
07:30:48.360 --> 07:30:50.548 align:start position:0%
needed if you have a very restrictive
definition

07:30:50.548 --> 07:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
definition
 
07:30:53.750 --> 07:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
then you could have people who are
 
07:30:53.760 --> 07:30:55.948 align:start position:0%
then you could have people who are
directly

07:30:55.948 --> 07:30:55.958 align:start position:0%
directly
 
07:31:00.070 --> 07:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
affected who are not defined as an
 
07:31:03.590 --> 07:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
abutter so that's what it all comes down
 
07:31:06.230 --> 07:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
to we defeated the
 
07:31:11.910 --> 07:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
amendment which seek to expand the
 
07:31:14.468 --> 07:31:14.478 align:start position:0%
definition so that we would include some
 
07:31:17.868 --> 07:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
of those people who are directly AFF we
 
07:31:20.948 --> 07:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
we defeated that
 
07:31:23.948 --> 07:31:23.958 align:start position:0%
this bill as
 
07:31:27.548 --> 07:31:27.558 align:start position:0%
written strikes the current
 
07:31:32.350 --> 07:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
language that says AG grieved
 
07:31:35.030 --> 07:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
parties and leaves that kind of up in
 
07:31:35.040 --> 07:31:37.070 align:start position:0%
parties and leaves that kind of up in
the

07:31:37.070 --> 07:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:31:40.190 --> 07:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
air so as far as I'm
 
07:31:43.830 --> 07:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
concerned we're better off with current
 
07:31:47.868 --> 07:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
law which gives a little bit more room
 
07:31:51.350 --> 07:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:53.830 --> 07:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
then this bill as
 
07:31:58.308 --> 07:31:58.318 align:start position:0%
written so please defeat the bill so we
 
07:32:07.308 --> 07:32:07.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:09.990 --> 07:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
much representative Len chot recognized
 
07:32:13.830 --> 07:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:17.110 --> 07:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
07:32:19.830 --> 07:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1359
 
07:32:21.868 --> 07:32:21.878 align:start position:0%
there are two parts to this bipartisan
 
07:32:24.990 --> 07:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
leg legislation the first removes
 
07:32:27.750 --> 07:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
extremely vague language uh from our
 
07:32:31.230 --> 07:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
current rsas that allow an unlimited
 
07:32:33.388 --> 07:32:33.398 align:start position:0%
list of individuals or parties to
 
07:32:35.868 --> 07:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily delay an applicants
 
07:32:39.110 --> 07:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
planning approval by using and abusing
 
07:32:42.350 --> 07:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
or abusing the appeal process uh to the
 
07:32:45.868 --> 07:32:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:48.150 --> 07:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
adjustment the two phrases that we
 
07:32:52.030 --> 07:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated in this uh language is an
 
07:32:55.788 --> 07:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
agreed person and one directly
 
07:32:58.308 --> 07:32:58.318 align:start position:0%
affected what does that mean what is an
 
07:33:00.708 --> 07:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
grieved person what is one directly
 
07:33:03.590 --> 07:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
affected under the current rsas somebody
 
07:33:07.510 --> 07:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
in another County in another
 
07:33:10.868 --> 07:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
state conceivably in another country is
 
07:33:10.878 --> 07:33:12.430 align:start position:0%
state conceivably in another country is
allowed

07:33:12.430 --> 07:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
07:33:15.270 --> 07:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
to classify themselves as an agreed
 
07:33:18.350 --> 07:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
person that in is part one of the
 
07:33:21.110 --> 07:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that we eliminate the second
 
07:33:21.120 --> 07:33:24.948 align:start position:0%
legislation that we eliminate the second
part

07:33:24.948 --> 07:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:28.948 --> 07:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
is it adds new and very spe specific
 
07:33:31.708 --> 07:33:31.718 align:start position:0%
definition of the phrase directly across
 
07:33:34.308 --> 07:33:34.318 align:start position:0%
the stream or street from to the abutter
 
07:33:36.990 --> 07:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
definition and removing any doubts about
 
07:33:39.750 --> 07:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
the interpretation now this definition
 
07:33:42.868 --> 07:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
was uh devised by two individuals who
 
07:33:44.708 --> 07:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
both have civil engineering experience
 
07:33:47.430 --> 07:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
in it so although it may look a little
 
07:33:49.948 --> 07:33:49.958 align:start position:0%
uh technical it is technical but it's
 
07:33:52.868 --> 07:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
also very specific and this proposed
 
07:33:55.030 --> 07:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
change came about while doing research
 
07:33:57.350 --> 07:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
on this bill there were Supreme Court
 
07:33:59.070 --> 07:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
case where there were very different
 
07:34:01.030 --> 07:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
interpretations of What that particular
 
07:34:03.670 --> 07:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
phrase of uh across the street of stream
 
07:34:06.788 --> 07:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
meant so again while the new definition
 
07:34:09.388 --> 07:34:09.398 align:start position:0%
looks uh complicated it's actually very
 
07:34:12.990 --> 07:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
specific and it leaves no room for
 
07:34:14.670 --> 07:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation now we've heard some
 
07:34:17.468 --> 07:34:17.478 align:start position:0%
arguments um and I'm talk against a
 
07:34:19.110 --> 07:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
couple of them one is the appeal process
 
07:34:21.548 --> 07:34:21.558 align:start position:0%
process would not change the ability of
 
07:34:23.350 --> 07:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
anyone who can demonstrate they are
 
07:34:25.510 --> 07:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
directly affected by to
 
07:34:28.190 --> 07:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
testify in the initial planning phase or
 
07:34:30.590 --> 07:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
during the appeal
 
07:34:33.468 --> 07:34:33.478 align:start position:0%
process the Selectmen the municipality's
 
07:34:36.110 --> 07:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
board or like a local legislative body
 
07:34:38.708 --> 07:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
for appeals any party to the action and
 
07:34:41.948 --> 07:34:41.958 align:start position:0%
a Butters still will have the ability to
 
07:34:44.910 --> 07:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
appeal now if there are individuals who
 
07:34:47.190 --> 07:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
are not a Butters or the the list that I
 
07:34:49.910 --> 07:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
just named they can certain testify and
 
07:34:53.628 --> 07:34:53.638 align:start position:0%
they can also certainly influence um
 
07:34:55.670 --> 07:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
some the long list of individuals I I
 
07:35:02.830 --> 07:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:05.708 --> 07:35:05.718 align:start position:0%
process now I mentioned at the beginning
 
07:35:07.948 --> 07:35:07.958 align:start position:0%
of the bill that this was a bipartisan
 
07:35:11.350 --> 07:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and it extends beyond the sponsors
 
07:35:13.388 --> 07:35:13.398 align:start position:0%
of the bill which are bipartisan and
 
07:35:15.270 --> 07:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
include individuals on the other side of
 
07:35:19.110 --> 07:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
the wall and it also uh supporting
 
07:35:20.788 --> 07:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
within the municipal and County
 
07:35:23.910 --> 07:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
government uh Committee in somewhat
 
07:35:26.270 --> 07:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
rather rare occurrence something we
 
07:35:27.948 --> 07:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
don't see very often in Municipal and
 
07:35:29.830 --> 07:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
County government outside parties and
 
07:35:31.628 --> 07:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
those who testified I think every one of
 
07:35:33.590 --> 07:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
them were all in agreement with this
 
07:35:35.430 --> 07:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think you all received
 
07:35:37.990 --> 07:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
a letter recently that included and
 
07:35:41.030 --> 07:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
again these five individuals are rarely
 
07:35:42.990 --> 07:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
on board with each
 
07:35:45.548 --> 07:35:45.558 align:start position:0%
other the New Hampshire Realtors the
 
07:35:48.070 --> 07:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
housing action in New Hampshire uh the
 
07:35:51.110 --> 07:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
president Co Bia New Hampshire Planning
 
07:35:53.910 --> 07:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
Association and the
 
07:35:57.388 --> 07:35:57.398 align:start position:0%
nhma all were signatures of the letter
 
07:35:59.788 --> 07:35:59.798 align:start position:0%
that each of you received in favor of
 
07:36:02.308 --> 07:36:02.318 align:start position:0%
this legislation so ultimately the aim
 
07:36:04.150 --> 07:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to reduce costly and
 
07:36:06.468 --> 07:36:06.478 align:start position:0%
timec consuming frivolous appeals by
 
07:36:09.308 --> 07:36:09.318 align:start position:0%
unaffected parties it will result in
 
07:36:11.030 --> 07:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
quicker approvals faster construction
 
07:36:13.708 --> 07:36:13.718 align:start position:0%
and therefore lower the overall cost and
 
07:36:15.308 --> 07:36:15.318 align:start position:0%
these points should be very appealing to
 
07:36:16.910 --> 07:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
those who believe we need more housing
 
07:36:19.750 --> 07:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
at a faster pace make no mistake there
 
07:36:21.910 --> 07:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
are many factors involved in our current
 
07:36:24.230 --> 07:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
housing situation and most of them we
 
07:36:26.948 --> 07:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
have no control over this legislation is
 
07:36:29.948 --> 07:36:29.958 align:start position:0%
but a small piece where we can reduce uh
 
07:36:31.948 --> 07:36:31.958 align:start position:0%
regulation reduce
 
07:36:34.548 --> 07:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and reduce unnecessary
 
07:36:37.110 --> 07:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
delays I ask that uh you press the green
 
07:36:38.910 --> 07:36:38.920 align:start position:0%

Mr
 
07:38:32.590 --> 07:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that impacts from a
 
07:38:35.910 --> 07:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
proposed land use project can be
 
07:38:38.990 --> 07:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
experienced well beyond the boundaries
 
07:38:41.750 --> 07:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
of an AB Butter's property that could
 
07:38:45.750 --> 07:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
affect such things as noise traffic
 
07:38:45.760 --> 07:38:46.948 align:start position:0%

07:38:49.788 --> 07:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
quality water Quant
 
07:38:53.430 --> 07:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
all of which could negatively impact the
 
07:38:57.230 --> 07:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
use and the value of one's
 
07:39:00.468 --> 07:39:00.478 align:start position:0%
property and if I knew that
 
07:39:02.548 --> 07:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
testifying as a
 
07:39:05.230 --> 07:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
witness at a public
 
07:39:08.910 --> 07:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
hearing gives you no legal rights
 
07:39:13.868 --> 07:39:13.878 align:start position:0%
whatsoever as opposed to being an
 
07:39:17.030 --> 07:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
appellant and if I further know that the
 
07:39:20.510 --> 07:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill is overly restricted Ive in that it
 
07:39:23.430 --> 07:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
excludes non-abundant Property Owners
 
07:39:25.070 --> 07:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
within the mun
 
07:39:28.270 --> 07:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
municipality from filing an
 
07:39:30.628 --> 07:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
appeal with the
 
07:39:33.308 --> 07:39:33.318 align:start position:0%
CBA even though they can demonstrate
 
07:39:35.548 --> 07:39:35.558 align:start position:0%
that their property is directly affected
 
07:39:38.548 --> 07:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
by a decision of a planning board or an
 
07:39:38.558 --> 07:39:41.110 align:start position:0%
by a decision of a planning board or an
administrative

07:39:41.110 --> 07:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
07:39:46.308 --> 07:39:46.318 align:start position:0%
officer and as such this bill unjustly
 
07:39:49.788 --> 07:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
denies an aggrieved non abing property
 
07:39:53.070 --> 07:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
owner their due process rights at the
 
07:39:57.430 --> 07:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
local level so would I now vote
 
07:40:00.750 --> 07:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
no and push the red button so that a
 
07:40:05.230 --> 07:40:05.240 align:start position:0%

07:40:14.468 --> 07:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:40:15.628 --> 07:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
07:40:18.468 --> 07:40:18.478 align:start position:0%
1359 helps curve abuses to the zone
 
07:40:20.750 --> 07:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
owning board appeal process and if I
 
07:40:23.628 --> 07:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
know those those abuses lengthen the
 
07:40:26.110 --> 07:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
appeal process and add great cost to
 
07:40:28.468 --> 07:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
projects and if I know that it makes it
 
07:40:30.510 --> 07:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible to build affordable
 
07:40:32.750 --> 07:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
housing when that occurs then when I
 
07:40:34.868 --> 07:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
push the green button to pass this
 
07:40:34.878 --> 07:40:38.070 align:start position:0%

any action it is
 
07:46:10.430 --> 07:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
enabling putting this language in
 
07:46:13.990 --> 07:46:14.000 align:start position:0%

testified that this bill was consistent
 
07:46:29.430 --> 07:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
with the 2010 Water Commission report
 
07:46:31.910 --> 07:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
findings where they found that there
 
07:46:34.788 --> 07:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
should be additional statutory language
 
07:46:37.030 --> 07:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
concerning the importance of water
 
07:46:39.388 --> 07:46:39.398 align:start position:0%

07:46:41.070 --> 07:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
Housing Development can the member
 
07:46:43.430 --> 07:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
suspend for a minute I don't know where
 
07:46:45.628 --> 07:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
everybody's going but made a little
 
07:46:48.670 --> 07:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
noise we can wait go on
 
07:46:48.680 --> 07:46:51.190 align:start position:0%
noise we can wait go on
coffee

07:46:51.190 --> 07:46:51.200 align:start position:0%

07:46:54.830 --> 07:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
oh thank you sorry that happened go on
 
07:46:54.840 --> 07:46:57.388 align:start position:0%
oh thank you sorry that happened go on
all

07:46:57.388 --> 07:46:57.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:00.868 --> 07:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
right yep continue thank
 
07:47:04.468 --> 07:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
you so as I was saying there was a 20110
 
07:47:06.868 --> 07:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
Water Commission report and the findings
 
07:47:08.590 --> 07:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
in that report were that it was
 
07:47:11.230 --> 07:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
important to put something about local
 
07:47:14.270 --> 07:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
water adequacy into statute so that
 
07:47:16.590 --> 07:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities would be looking at that
 
07:47:18.670 --> 07:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
when they're considering
 
07:47:21.070 --> 07:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
developments um but at the time the
 
07:47:22.708 --> 07:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
commission was really unsure of how to
 
07:47:25.190 --> 07:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
accomplish that and during the hearing
 
07:47:27.670 --> 07:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
the expert that came in from de's water
 
07:47:29.868 --> 07:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
department said that this bill would
 
07:47:31.510 --> 07:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
actually be consistent with what they
 
07:47:33.350 --> 07:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
were recommending at the
 
07:47:36.270 --> 07:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
time um and this bill is the result of
 
07:47:39.030 --> 07:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
two years worth of work and it was um
 
07:47:42.510 --> 07:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan in support and also in
 
07:47:44.670 --> 07:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
sponsorship uh so I'm asking that we
 
07:47:46.868 --> 07:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
take that action that was recommended by
 
07:47:49.590 --> 07:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
first voting down this itl
 
07:47:52.788 --> 07:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
motion hb1
 
07:47:56.990 --> 07:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
1483 uh exempts Community water systems
 
07:47:59.948 --> 07:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
and large groundwater withdrawals so
 
07:48:01.430 --> 07:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's not overly
 
07:48:04.110 --> 07:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
burdensome it keeps decision-making in
 
07:48:06.868 --> 07:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
the hands of local planners rather than
 
07:48:09.350 --> 07:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
trying to mandate a one-size fits-all
 
07:48:12.190 --> 07:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
approach it treats water as a high
 
07:48:15.388 --> 07:48:15.398 align:start position:0%
priority in the approval process like we
 
07:48:18.788 --> 07:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
do with septic planning h
 
07:48:22.270 --> 07:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
1483 is timely because as we've heard
 
07:48:24.628 --> 07:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
today New Hampshire's being asked to
 
07:48:27.308 --> 07:48:27.318 align:start position:0%
rapidly add housing stock to meet
 
07:48:27.318 --> 07:48:28.350 align:start position:0%
rapidly add housing stock to meet
growing

07:48:28.350 --> 07:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
growing
 
07:48:31.628 --> 07:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
demand um this simple en enabling
 
07:48:34.030 --> 07:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
legislation can make sure that local
 
07:48:36.110 --> 07:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
boards don't skimp on getting
 
07:48:36.120 --> 07:48:37.670 align:start position:0%
boards don't skimp on getting
subdivisions

07:48:37.670 --> 07:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
07:48:40.628 --> 07:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
right uh this this bill asks planning
 
07:48:43.590 --> 07:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
boards to prescribe minimum on lot
 
07:48:45.990 --> 07:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
private well testing requirements to
 
07:48:49.430 --> 07:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
assure adequate water body supply for
 
07:48:53.070 --> 07:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions as defined in RSA 674 colon
 
07:48:56.990 --> 07:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
36 section 2 that is not the same as
 
07:49:00.350 --> 07:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
requiring expensive hydrology studies on
 
07:49:03.190 --> 07:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
every project the intent is to create
 
07:49:06.308 --> 07:49:06.318 align:start position:0%
Clarity between the municipality and the
 
07:49:09.350 --> 07:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
developer at the outset of the project
 
07:49:11.270 --> 07:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
on what is needed to support multiple
 
07:49:11.280 --> 07:49:12.308 align:start position:0%
on what is needed to support multiple
new

07:49:12.308 --> 07:49:12.318 align:start position:0%
new
 
07:49:15.990 --> 07:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
builds while minimizing disruption to
 
07:49:19.230 --> 07:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
existing Neighbors on private Wells we
 
07:49:21.430 --> 07:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
may all know someone who has had their
 
07:49:24.510 --> 07:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
well affected by a nearby development
 
07:49:27.430 --> 07:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
this helps manage that issue the only
 
07:49:29.868 --> 07:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill came from the
 
07:49:32.468 --> 07:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Realtor Association and
 
07:49:34.468 --> 07:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
they're a powerful Lobby and of course
 
07:49:36.070 --> 07:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
they're concerned with anything that
 
07:49:38.150 --> 07:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
might increase costs for their members
 
07:49:41.388 --> 07:49:41.398 align:start position:0%
bottom line but we have an obligation to
 
07:49:43.628 --> 07:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of our constituents
 
07:49:45.948 --> 07:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
when it comes to essential resources
 
07:49:48.110 --> 07:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more essential than
 
07:49:51.830 --> 07:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
adequate water please vote no on the itl
 
07:49:53.788 --> 07:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
because now is the time to get this
 
07:49:56.628 --> 07:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
change onto the books and vote no on the
 
07:49:59.230 --> 07:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
itl because this workable bipartisan
 
07:50:02.670 --> 07:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
bill is favored by Town planners thank
 
07:50:04.590 --> 07:50:04.600 align:start position:0%

to speak for the committee
 
07:50:14.948 --> 07:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker first I'd
 
07:50:17.070 --> 07:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
like to clarify I believe that this bill
 
07:50:19.388 --> 07:50:19.398 align:start position:0%
is up from for interim study by the
 
07:50:22.548 --> 07:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
majority not itl interim
 
07:50:26.510 --> 07:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
study although this bill HB 1483 does
 
07:50:29.270 --> 07:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
propose enabling legislation the
 
07:50:31.750 --> 07:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee did discuss was it really
 
07:50:34.110 --> 07:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
necessary could not subdivision
 
07:50:36.910 --> 07:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
regulations of municipalities already be
 
07:50:39.708 --> 07:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
adopted to provide the regulations
 
07:50:42.110 --> 07:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
concerning water supply we receed no
 
07:50:44.590 --> 07:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
legal opinion that it couldn't already
 
07:50:48.308 --> 07:50:48.318 align:start position:0%
be adopted the potential cost developers
 
07:50:50.708 --> 07:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
in a market where housing is drastically
 
07:50:53.430 --> 07:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
needed was also a concern that if the
 
07:50:55.830 --> 07:50:55.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
07:53:59.430 --> 07:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that the building of new
 
07:54:02.190 --> 07:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
developments can and does affect the
 
07:54:05.430 --> 07:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
availability of water in the vicinity
 
07:54:07.628 --> 07:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that this might not
 
07:54:10.548 --> 07:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
necess necessarily happen in a town like
 
07:54:14.388 --> 07:54:14.398 align:start position:0%
mine like nasua but that it does happen
 
07:54:18.510 --> 07:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
in many other towns in New Hampshire
 
07:54:21.388 --> 07:54:21.398 align:start position:0%
and if I know that house bill 1483 is
 
07:54:21.398 --> 07:54:23.350 align:start position:0%
and if I know that house bill 1483 is
enabling

07:54:23.350 --> 07:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
07:54:26.190 --> 07:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
legislation with bipartisan support
 
07:54:28.990 --> 07:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
which means that no town is forced to
 
07:54:31.468 --> 07:54:31.478 align:start position:0%
participate but if a town is having this
 
07:54:33.350 --> 07:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
problem they can opt
 
07:54:36.830 --> 07:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
in would I now press the red button on
 
07:54:39.388 --> 07:54:39.398 align:start position:0%

07:54:42.070 --> 07:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made one that can
 
07:54:45.070 --> 07:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
get this legislation over to the other
 
07:54:47.308 --> 07:54:47.318 align:start position:0%
chamber for consideration by the people
 
07:54:49.548 --> 07:54:49.558 align:start position:0%

know that this bill requires a quote
 
07:55:12.190 --> 07:55:12.200 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that last year a
 
07:55:24.670 --> 07:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
similar Bill required a requiring a
 
07:55:27.788 --> 07:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
hydraul study prior to subdivision
 
07:55:30.708 --> 07:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
approval was rejected by the
 
07:55:34.708 --> 07:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
committee due to high costs long delays
 
07:55:36.388 --> 07:55:36.398 align:start position:0%
and questionable
 
07:55:39.308 --> 07:55:39.318 align:start position:0%

provided as to what what this
 
07:55:53.230 --> 07:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
proposed water supply study actually
 
07:55:56.350 --> 07:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
entailed therefore would it not be
 
07:56:00.468 --> 07:56:00.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary for me
 
07:56:05.468 --> 07:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
to to to have to vote for the committee
 
07:56:09.350 --> 07:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
to exercise due diligence and Inter
 
07:56:13.670 --> 07:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
interim study this bill to actually
 
07:56:17.590 --> 07:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
determine what a water supply study
 
07:56:17.600 --> 07:56:18.628 align:start position:0%
determine what a water supply study
really

07:56:18.628 --> 07:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
really
 
07:56:21.590 --> 07:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
means hopefully it's not a hydrology
 
07:56:23.510 --> 07:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
study in sheep's
 
07:56:26.030 --> 07:56:26.040 align:start position:0%

that the state could do something to fix
 
08:01:47.548 --> 08:01:47.558 align:start position:0%
what The Regulators had broken for no
 
08:01:47.558 --> 08:01:48.670 align:start position:0%
what The Regulators had broken for no
apparent

08:01:48.670 --> 08:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
apparent
 
08:01:51.670 --> 08:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
reason that bill was HB
 
08:01:55.468 --> 08:01:55.478 align:start position:0%
549 and as many of you may recall uh we
 
08:01:57.830 --> 08:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
passed that at the Double Tree and it
 
08:02:02.990 --> 08:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
was 343 to0 now I know many of you have
 
08:02:04.670 --> 08:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
been in this house a long time very few
 
08:02:07.788 --> 08:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
things pass without even one person
 
08:02:10.468 --> 08:02:10.478 align:start position:0%
objecting but that was a good day and
 
08:02:12.270 --> 08:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
the bill was quickly signed into law by
 
08:02:14.948 --> 08:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
Governor cunu HB
 
08:02:18.708 --> 08:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
549 put explicit guard rails around the
 
08:02:20.948 --> 08:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
pu's administration of the New Hampshire
 
08:02:20.958 --> 08:02:21.910 align:start position:0%
pu's administration of the New Hampshire
saves

08:02:21.910 --> 08:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
saves
 
08:02:25.350 --> 08:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
program this bill offers to hand the
 
08:02:27.430 --> 08:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
guard rails back to the folks who caused
 
08:02:29.070 --> 08:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
that problem in the first
 
08:02:33.388 --> 08:02:33.398 align:start position:0%
place uh HB 549 told the
 
08:02:36.270 --> 08:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
puc how to handle the review process for
 
08:02:38.910 --> 08:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves we defined the tools
 
08:02:41.070 --> 08:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
that they would use in the review for
 
08:02:44.388 --> 08:02:44.398 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness and uh one of those
 
08:02:46.548 --> 08:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
tools the evaluation measurement and
 
08:02:49.150 --> 08:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
verification study was to be conducted
 
08:02:51.948 --> 08:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
by a professional uh under the guidance
 
08:02:53.628 --> 08:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy and the
 
08:02:56.030 --> 08:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
joint utilities so we made everything
 
08:02:58.468 --> 08:02:58.478 align:start position:0%
very very clear in statute the lines of
 
08:03:02.388 --> 08:03:02.398 align:start position:0%
authority were defined and the chaos uh
 
08:03:04.510 --> 08:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
that we had to fix with the pu's
 
08:03:06.990 --> 08:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
handling of New Hampshire saves would
 
08:03:08.270 --> 08:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
not be
 
08:03:11.590 --> 08:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
repeated this bill puts conflicting
 
08:03:14.110 --> 08:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
language into the statute and creates
 
08:03:16.590 --> 08:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
competing lines of authority the there
 
08:03:18.628 --> 08:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
was no compelling reason given in the
 
08:03:20.990 --> 08:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
hearings for creating this competitive
 
08:03:21.000 --> 08:03:22.308 align:start position:0%
hearings for creating this competitive
statutory

08:03:22.308 --> 08:03:22.318 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
08:03:25.150 --> 08:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
language so please protect our excellent
 
08:03:26.868 --> 08:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves
 
08:03:29.830 --> 08:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
program uh Energy Efficiency in general
 
08:03:32.030 --> 08:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
which is an excellent value for all of
 
08:03:34.628 --> 08:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
us um there's no reason to give The
 
08:03:37.910 --> 08:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
Regulators the authority to reset a
 
08:03:42.270 --> 08:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
defined policy we set the policy and
 
08:03:45.948 --> 08:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
they carry it out we did that for them
 
08:03:51.350 --> 08:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
in a of 30 343 to Z I respect
 
08:03:53.708 --> 08:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you vote no on the
 
08:03:55.910 --> 08:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so that a better motion
 
08:03:56.948 --> 08:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
can be
 
08:04:00.708 --> 08:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
made uh and Mr Speaker I request uh a
 
08:04:03.548 --> 08:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
division vote thank
 
08:04:05.548 --> 08:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington's
 
08:04:07.628 --> 08:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
recognized speak for the committee
 
08:04:11.948 --> 08:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker um this bill
 
08:04:14.510 --> 08:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
is u a little different but we need a
 
08:04:16.070 --> 08:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
little background what the Imp purpose
 
08:04:17.830 --> 08:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
of this this is the purpose of the
 
08:04:20.670 --> 08:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
system benefit charge it's paid for 100%
 
08:04:22.868 --> 08:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
by the rate payers and it's only one
 
08:04:24.708 --> 08:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
purpose is to provide cost effective
 
08:04:27.190 --> 08:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency projects for the state
 
08:04:29.350 --> 08:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
period we heard a lot of people were
 
08:04:31.350 --> 08:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
complaining about possible changes
 
08:04:33.388 --> 08:04:33.398 align:start position:0%
because it would affect the utilities
 
08:04:35.590 --> 08:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
they have to change the their planning
 
08:04:37.308 --> 08:04:37.318 align:start position:0%
or it would affect the contractors who
 
08:04:41.270 --> 08:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
install Energy Efficiency uh uh programs
 
08:04:43.388 --> 08:04:43.398 align:start position:0%
they we don't really care that's they
 
08:04:44.510 --> 08:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
they should be lucky they're getting the
 
08:04:46.110 --> 08:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
money for this there's only one purpose
 
08:04:48.750 --> 08:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
of this again it's for the coste
 
08:04:51.708 --> 08:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
effective Energy Efficiency projects now
 
08:04:54.308 --> 08:04:54.318 align:start position:0%
the Pu developed this and we had a lot
 
08:04:57.628 --> 08:04:57.638 align:start position:0%
of different things going on but they
 
08:04:59.110 --> 08:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
came to the Department of energy
 
08:05:00.868 --> 08:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
actually came to us and asked us to give
 
08:05:03.190 --> 08:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
us some flexibility in the future so let
 
08:05:05.190 --> 08:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
me tell you how let me just read so I
 
08:05:07.670 --> 08:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
tell you how flexible this is what we
 
08:05:09.070 --> 08:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
what they're using right now is called
 
08:05:12.030 --> 08:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
the granite state test and the as a
 
08:05:13.548 --> 08:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
secondary one it's called The Total
 
08:05:17.510 --> 08:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
Resource cost test this law would say
 
08:05:19.948 --> 08:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
that when reviewing cost Effectiveness
 
08:05:21.590 --> 08:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
for the program years through and
 
08:05:24.628 --> 08:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
including 2026 the commission shall use
 
08:05:26.628 --> 08:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
the granite state test as its primary
 
08:05:29.548 --> 08:05:29.558 align:start position:0%
test and the total cost Total Resource
 
08:05:31.628 --> 08:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
cost test as a secondary the commission
 
08:05:33.430 --> 08:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
may consider modifications to the
 
08:05:35.430 --> 08:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
granite state test and different or
 
08:05:36.948 --> 08:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
additional tests developed through an
 
08:05:39.468 --> 08:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process and approved by
 
08:05:40.910 --> 08:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
them prior to commencement of any
 
08:05:44.388 --> 08:05:44.398 align:start position:0%
trianal period and any provided any such
 
08:05:46.590 --> 08:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
order is to be issued no less than 12
 
08:05:48.150 --> 08:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
months probably the beginning of that
 
08:05:50.350 --> 08:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
trienal period in which the test is be
 
08:05:53.070 --> 08:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
to be applied so it gives them
 
08:05:55.030 --> 08:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility to go back and know that
 
08:05:57.308 --> 08:05:57.318 align:start position:0%
things change discount rates change
 
08:05:59.628 --> 08:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
interest rates change ways of looking at
 
08:06:01.350 --> 08:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency could change with times these
 
08:06:03.110 --> 08:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
is basically this Grand state test was
 
08:06:05.708 --> 08:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
developed it'll be 10 years by the time
 
08:06:08.110 --> 08:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
the Pu gets to revisit it so that gives
 
08:06:10.150 --> 08:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
them the flexibility to do that but it
 
08:06:13.110 --> 08:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
also builts in the 12-month period so if
 
08:06:15.190 --> 08:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
we feel that they've done a really bad
 
08:06:17.270 --> 08:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
job that gives us an year to turn around
 
08:06:20.270 --> 08:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
and say no don't do that so it gives him
 
08:06:22.430 --> 08:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility to keep up with the times
 
08:06:26.350 --> 08:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
until HB 549 was passed the Pu always
 
08:06:28.230 --> 08:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
had the authority to set those par
 
08:06:29.788 --> 08:06:29.798 align:start position:0%
parameters this is the first time we've
 
08:06:32.468 --> 08:06:32.478 align:start position:0%
ever changed it so we're saying in the
 
08:06:35.270 --> 08:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
future allow them the flexibility of
 
08:06:37.468 --> 08:06:37.478 align:start position:0%
looking at possibilities because world
 
08:06:40.750 --> 08:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
does change circumstances change maybe
 
08:06:42.670 --> 08:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
the way we do Energy Efficiency cost
 
08:06:44.990 --> 08:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation needs to change but either
 
08:06:47.110 --> 08:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
way there's a safety Val in there if the
 
08:06:49.150 --> 08:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't like it it has him a
 
08:06:51.750 --> 08:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
year to change it to to override that if
 
08:06:55.990 --> 08:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
wano so please vote green on this thank
 
08:06:58.910 --> 08:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
you the question is on the majority is
 
08:07:00.990 --> 08:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
on the motion of ought to pass as
 
08:07:03.430 --> 08:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 1036
 
08:07:05.230 --> 08:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney requests a roll
 
08:07:07.388 --> 08:07:07.398 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently
 
08:07:09.670 --> 08:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
seconded that's sufficiently seconded
 
08:07:11.308 --> 08:07:11.318 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
08:07:15.110 --> 08:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:15.120 --> 08:07:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
seats

08:07:45.030 --> 08:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:45.040 --> 08:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

08:08:04.230 --> 08:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:05.990 --> 08:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the questions on the motion of a to pass
 
08:08:08.990 --> 08:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
as amended on House Bill 1036 this is a
 
08:08:10.230 --> 08:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
08:08:12.708 --> 08:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
vote representative Wendy Thomas is
 
08:08:14.990 --> 08:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary
 
08:08:15.000 --> 08:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary
inquiry

08:08:19.430 --> 08:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:23.708 --> 08:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:26.910 --> 08:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker are they
 
08:08:30.270 --> 08:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
okay all good okay all right uh Mr
 
08:08:32.750 --> 08:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this bill was
 
08:08:35.030 --> 08:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
presented as providing flexibility for
 
08:08:37.468 --> 08:08:37.478 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission to
 
08:08:40.388 --> 08:08:40.398 align:start position:0%
modify cost Effectiveness tests being
 
08:08:43.868 --> 08:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
used to approve the three-year NH saves
 
08:08:46.270 --> 08:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
plan however the tests current Curr ly
 
08:08:49.308 --> 08:08:49.318 align:start position:0%
being used have been agreed to by all
 
08:08:52.030 --> 08:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and placed in statute to
 
08:08:54.430 --> 08:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
provide Clarity and consistency to the
 
08:08:57.150 --> 08:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
Joint utilities who are charged with
 
08:09:00.510 --> 08:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
running NH saves so there is absolutely
 
08:09:03.910 --> 08:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
no need to modify them and if I know
 
08:09:06.708 --> 08:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
this bill contradicts existing statutory
 
08:09:10.150 --> 08:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
language and brings confusion to Long
 
08:09:12.510 --> 08:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
established process as to where
 
08:09:15.430 --> 08:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
Authority rests for any cost benefit
 
08:09:15.440 --> 08:09:16.990 align:start position:0%
Authority rests for any cost benefit
analysis

08:09:16.990 --> 08:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
08:09:19.510 --> 08:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know this is
 
08:09:22.548 --> 08:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
exactly why the legislature stepped in
 
08:09:26.308 --> 08:09:26.318 align:start position:0%
three years ago to set clear guard rails

state's Energy Efficiency programs when
 
08:09:40.548 --> 08:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
we passed HB
 
08:09:44.468 --> 08:09:44.478 align:start position:0%

08:09:47.788 --> 08:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button so that a
 
08:09:50.150 --> 08:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
different motion can be made thank you
 
08:09:50.160 --> 08:09:51.150 align:start position:0%
different motion can be made thank you
Mr

08:09:51.150 --> 08:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
08:09:53.670 --> 08:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative V is recognized
 
08:09:55.868 --> 08:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary
 
08:09:59.030 --> 08:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
08:10:01.468 --> 08:10:01.478 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that one prominent
 
08:10:04.388 --> 08:10:04.398 align:start position:0%
State regulator said of the law under
 
08:10:08.070 --> 08:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
debate here this afternoon and I quote
 
08:10:10.030 --> 08:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
if you like rate payer funded Energy
 
08:10:13.230 --> 08:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
Efficiency you favor a low discount rate
 
08:10:15.030 --> 08:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
and if you think rate payer funded
 
08:10:17.230 --> 08:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is bad public policy
 
08:10:19.468 --> 08:10:19.478 align:start position:0%
you prefer a high discount
 
08:10:23.388 --> 08:10:23.398 align:start position:0%
rate which means that existing policy
 
08:10:26.990 --> 08:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
can be manipulated to favor a particular
 
08:10:31.590 --> 08:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
outcome which does a disservice to our
 
08:10:34.388 --> 08:10:34.398 align:start position:0%
constituents but if I also know that
 
08:10:35.708 --> 08:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
08:10:39.270 --> 08:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
1036 provides a more Equitable framework
 
08:10:41.910 --> 08:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
for determining the cost effectiveness
 
08:10:44.270 --> 08:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
of Energy Efficiency
 
08:10:46.910 --> 08:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
programs and finally if I know that good
 
08:10:51.628 --> 08:10:51.638 align:start position:0%
public policy enshrines objectivity and
 
08:10:55.030 --> 08:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
neutrality to the greatest extent
 
08:10:57.270 --> 08:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
possible would I now press the green
 
08:10:58.910 --> 08:10:58.920 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker hb1
 
08:15:58.430 --> 08:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
1623 represents a radical reversal of
 
08:16:00.270 --> 08:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
long-standing energy policy which has
 
08:16:02.868 --> 08:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
served our state well and also an
 
08:16:05.150 --> 08:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
extreme departure from our
 
08:16:07.110 --> 08:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional relationship to the
 
08:16:10.270 --> 08:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
federal government its agencies and
 
08:16:12.548 --> 08:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
regulations this bill
 
08:16:14.830 --> 08:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
replaces the well-balanced current
 
08:16:17.110 --> 08:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
energy policy which
 
08:16:19.590 --> 08:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
integrates the private sector's need to
 
08:16:21.430 --> 08:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
make a profit with the Public's need to
 
08:16:24.468 --> 08:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
receive a beneficial service replaces
 
08:16:27.628 --> 08:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
that with a protectionist anti-market
 
08:16:30.228 --> 08:16:30.238 align:start position:0%
screed what one of the testifiers in our
 
08:16:32.750 --> 08:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing called a spaghetti code
 
08:16:35.910 --> 08:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
an unworkable jumble of
 
08:16:38.270 --> 08:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
contradictory language and terms which
 
08:16:40.830 --> 08:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
seeks to place its thumb on the
 
08:16:43.350 --> 08:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
scale in favor of clinging like a
 
08:16:45.670 --> 08:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
security blanket to traditional fossil
 
08:16:48.070 --> 08:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
fuel energy sources and power generating
 
08:16:51.628 --> 08:16:51.638 align:start position:0%
stations that don't even belong to
 
08:16:54.628 --> 08:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
us this bill seems to be motivated out
 
08:16:56.548 --> 08:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
of an irrational fear of an energy
 
08:16:58.910 --> 08:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
transition that we've been we've been in
 
08:17:00.948 --> 08:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
for quite a time
 
08:17:04.868 --> 08:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
now and uh which has accelerated
 
08:17:07.150 --> 08:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
recently due to our acknowledged need to
 
08:17:09.430 --> 08:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
wean ourselves off of fossil
 
08:17:12.430 --> 08:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
fuels are there examples of where the
 
08:17:14.110 --> 08:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
government has come in and shut down
 
08:17:15.708 --> 08:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
power generating stations and
 
08:17:18.150 --> 08:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
destabilize the grid the fictional
 
08:17:20.548 --> 08:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
situation which seems to motivate the
 
08:17:22.468 --> 08:17:22.478 align:start position:0%
authors the proponents of this bill I
 
08:17:23.948 --> 08:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
08:17:26.590 --> 08:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
so as a matter of fact recently the
 
08:17:29.270 --> 08:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration has responsibly
 
08:17:31.708 --> 08:17:31.718 align:start position:0%
slowed down its ruem on several fronts
 
08:17:34.628 --> 08:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
in order to not destabilize the
 
08:17:38.590 --> 08:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
electricity markets and transition too
 
08:17:42.110 --> 08:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
quickly this bill asserts quote unquote
 
08:17:47.110 --> 08:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
the state's police power to protect and
 
08:17:49.430 --> 08:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
defend power generation within our
 
08:17:50.868 --> 08:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
state's borders in other words it would
 
08:17:53.628 --> 08:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
have the state expropriate private
 
08:17:55.990 --> 08:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
companies property and production for
 
08:17:58.628 --> 08:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
the state's own needs not a good look
 
08:18:01.110 --> 08:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
for the Live Free or Die
 
08:18:04.190 --> 08:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
State this police power of expropriation
 
08:18:05.750 --> 08:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
would depend on our department of
 
08:18:08.868 --> 08:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
Energy's role in overseeing and
 
08:18:11.350 --> 08:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
unwinding Federal rules and regulations
 
08:18:13.708 --> 08:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
that would theoretically conflict with
 
08:18:15.990 --> 08:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
this newly established internal energy
 
08:18:18.150 --> 08:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
Market this is a role that the
 
08:18:20.228 --> 08:18:20.238 align:start position:0%
department politely declined in our
 
08:18:20.238 --> 08:18:21.228 align:start position:0%
department politely declined in our
public

08:18:21.228 --> 08:18:21.238 align:start position:0%
public
 
08:18:23.350 --> 08:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
hearings saying they didn't think it was
 
08:18:25.948 --> 08:18:25.958 align:start position:0%
a viable or productive use of its time
 
08:18:28.070 --> 08:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
and instead insisting that we continue
 
08:18:30.830 --> 08:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
to defer to the independent system
 
08:18:32.228 --> 08:18:32.238 align:start position:0%
administrator of our regional
 
08:18:35.110 --> 08:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
transmission system the iso New England
 
08:18:36.788 --> 08:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
in other words the the work that this
 
08:18:38.868 --> 08:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
bill wants done can't be done by the
 
08:18:40.910 --> 08:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
agency that would be charged with
 
08:18:42.868 --> 08:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
carrying it
 
08:18:45.788 --> 08:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
out this bill claims to be
 
08:18:47.670 --> 08:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
Market based and neutral in terms of the
 
08:18:49.228 --> 08:18:49.238 align:start position:0%
energy sources that it would seek to
 
08:18:52.708 --> 08:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
develop but in the very same section
 
08:18:54.308 --> 08:18:54.318 align:start position:0%
says that the state of New Hampshire
 
08:18:57.110 --> 08:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
would seek to develop quote dispatchable
 
08:18:59.070 --> 08:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
and reliable energy sources which is
 
08:19:00.910 --> 08:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
code language to undermine renewable
 
08:19:02.948 --> 08:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
energy development in our state it's
 
08:19:05.708 --> 08:19:05.718 align:start position:0%
anything but market-based and neutral as
 
08:19:07.670 --> 08:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact the market is clearly
 
08:19:09.510 --> 08:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
spoken across the country and renewable
 
08:19:12.030 --> 08:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
energy plus storage which is
 
08:19:15.670 --> 08:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
dispatchable is the cheapest source of
 
08:19:17.388 --> 08:19:17.398 align:start position:0%
new generation and is leading the charge
 
08:19:21.308 --> 08:19:21.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:24.228 --> 08:19:24.238 align:start position:0%
country by assessing by asserting the
 
08:19:26.110 --> 08:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
state's right to set up and regulate
 
08:19:28.030 --> 08:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
this new internal energy
 
08:19:30.990 --> 08:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
Market this bill clearly stands an
 
08:19:32.788 --> 08:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to the market forces it's

inquiry thank you Mr
 
08:29:02.308 --> 08:29:02.318 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that when my friend
 
08:29:04.350 --> 08:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
from eping introduced this bill in
 
08:29:07.190 --> 08:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee he called it the New Hampshire
 
08:29:10.430 --> 08:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
energy independ Independence
 
08:29:14.628 --> 08:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
act but if I also know that we are part
 
08:29:17.670 --> 08:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the iso New England grid and
 
08:29:21.308 --> 08:29:21.318 align:start position:0%
inexorably tied into it and that energy
 
08:29:23.308 --> 08:29:23.318 align:start position:0%
produced in New Hampshire flows out of
 
08:29:25.430 --> 08:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
state and energy produced out of state
 
08:29:26.948 --> 08:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
flows into New
 
08:29:30.228 --> 08:29:30.238 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if I also know that New
 
08:29:36.590 --> 08:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire produces no oil gas or coal so
 
08:29:39.910 --> 08:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
that anyone that needs fossil fuels
 
08:29:42.228 --> 08:29:42.238 align:start position:0%
whether it be a power generator or home
 
08:29:45.910 --> 08:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
heating must be important in from out of
 
08:29:49.910 --> 08:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
state then Mr Speaker would I be forced
 
08:29:49.920 --> 08:29:50.670 align:start position:0%
state then Mr Speaker would I be forced
to

08:29:50.670 --> 08:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:29:54.308 --> 08:29:54.318 align:start position:0%
conclude that New Hampshire energy
 
08:29:57.708 --> 08:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
Independence is but a pipe dream and
 
08:30:00.308 --> 08:30:00.318 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that our
 
08:30:12.110 --> 08:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
current climate policy has been called a
 
08:30:14.910 --> 08:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
malange of mixed messages
 
08:30:17.830 --> 08:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
by one prominent State regulator and
 
08:30:20.190 --> 08:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
that it should instead guarantee the
 
08:30:23.670 --> 08:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our citizens by
 
08:30:29.030 --> 08:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:30:31.910 --> 08:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
power and Mr Speaker if I also know that
 
08:30:35.228 --> 08:30:35.238 align:start position:0%
overzealous regulatory edicts can
 
08:30:38.030 --> 08:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
directly affect a generator's financial
 
08:30:42.708 --> 08:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
viability and might Force its premature
 
08:30:45.070 --> 08:30:45.080 align:start position:0%

08:30:47.190 --> 08:30:47.200 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker and
 
08:34:22.670 --> 08:34:22.680 align:start position:0%

08:34:25.750 --> 08:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill began Life as a good
 
08:34:29.350 --> 08:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
faith effort to clarify and even to be a
 
08:34:29.360 --> 08:34:30.990 align:start position:0%
faith effort to clarify and even to be a
housekeeping

08:34:30.990 --> 08:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
08:34:34.628 --> 08:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
Bill uh that non-citizens could and how
 
08:34:36.308 --> 08:34:36.318 align:start position:0%
they would obtain and when they could
 
08:34:38.350 --> 08:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
obtain a driver's
 
08:34:42.228 --> 08:34:42.238 align:start position:0%
license uh those folks include people
 
08:34:44.430 --> 08:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
who come to work here
 
08:34:47.708 --> 08:34:47.718 align:start position:0%
here and they include folks who come to
 
08:34:51.750 --> 08:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
young people who come to study here and
 
08:34:54.548 --> 08:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
all of my comments today will be related
 
08:34:58.830 --> 08:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
to uh people who are here legally in in
 
08:34:58.840 --> 08:35:01.110 align:start position:0%
to uh people who are here legally in in
all

08:35:01.110 --> 08:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
08:35:01.120 --> 08:35:02.708 align:start position:0%
all
circumstances

08:35:02.708 --> 08:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
08:35:05.388 --> 08:35:05.398 align:start position:0%
instead an amendment has been
 
08:35:07.948 --> 08:35:07.958 align:start position:0%
introduced and for the moment I'm going
 
08:35:12.308 --> 08:35:12.318 align:start position:0%
to keep my remarks to the amendment
 
08:35:15.190 --> 08:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
itself the Amendment included language
 
08:35:18.628 --> 08:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
that completely contradicts current DMV
 
08:35:20.670 --> 08:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
rules and
 
08:35:23.788 --> 08:35:23.798 align:start position:0%
practices So currently
 
08:35:27.388 --> 08:35:27.398 align:start position:0%
ases who are here legally in the
 
08:35:29.350 --> 08:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
country will
 
08:35:33.228 --> 08:35:33.238 align:start position:0%
wait to hear have their hearing in some
 
08:35:36.190 --> 08:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
cases those hearings determining their
 
08:35:40.110 --> 08:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
permanent status can be delayed in fact
 
08:35:41.948 --> 08:35:41.958 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
08:35:44.190 --> 08:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
delayed 10
 
08:35:48.308 --> 08:35:48.318 align:start position:0%
12 years even more in the meantime the
 
08:35:52.228 --> 08:35:52.238 align:start position:0%
federal government has made it a is part
 
08:35:55.670 --> 08:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the federal government to say if you
 
08:35:59.150 --> 08:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
do not hear have your hearing within one
 
08:36:03.670 --> 08:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
year of uh the time that you apply for
 
08:36:07.228 --> 08:36:07.238 align:start position:0%
Asylum then you will be given a work
 
08:36:10.350 --> 08:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
permit and then the DMV under its
 
08:36:13.590 --> 08:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
current practice would say well you're
 
08:36:17.110 --> 08:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
here legally you have a work permit you
 
08:36:19.948 --> 08:36:19.958 align:start position:0%
should be able to drive and by the way
 
08:36:22.150 --> 08:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
you can as long as you come down and you
 
08:36:25.228 --> 08:36:25.238 align:start position:0%
take the written exam you take the
 
08:36:27.590 --> 08:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
Practical exam and you prove that you
 
08:36:32.670 --> 08:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:36:35.190 --> 08:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
driver the
 
08:36:38.150 --> 08:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
amendment changes all of
 
08:36:41.548 --> 08:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
that um what's really unfortunate about
 
08:36:45.990 --> 08:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment also is unclear
 
08:36:48.468 --> 08:36:48.478 align:start position:0%
about whether people who have already
 
08:36:50.788 --> 08:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
obtained their driver's license in this
 
08:36:53.590 --> 08:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
manner will be able to renew that
 
08:36:56.030 --> 08:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
driver's license and I want to tell a
 
08:36:59.070 --> 08:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
very brief story about how as an example
 
08:37:00.670 --> 08:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
how this works
 
08:37:03.628 --> 08:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
practically we have a young person
 
08:37:05.110 --> 08:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
living in the city of
 
08:37:08.830 --> 08:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
Lebanon arrived here more than 10 years
 
08:37:12.070 --> 08:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
ago his son began
 
08:37:16.308 --> 08:37:16.318 align:start position:0%
School in in first grade I believe he's
 
08:37:20.548 --> 08:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
in high school now his young daughter is
 
08:37:24.868 --> 08:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
in the elementary school still he
 
08:37:29.388 --> 08:37:29.398 align:start position:0%
volunteers his time with uh a couple of
 
08:37:31.948 --> 08:37:31.958 align:start position:0%
the city's commissions so where resident
 
08:37:35.150 --> 08:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
input is important and he works
 
08:37:37.590 --> 08:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
full-time and supports his family he
 
08:37:40.548 --> 08:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
works for a nonprofit agency that
 
08:37:44.350 --> 08:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
provides services to the less needy
 
08:37:47.030 --> 08:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
he pays more
 
08:37:47.040 --> 08:37:48.670 align:start position:0%
he pays more
than

08:37:48.670 --> 08:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
08:37:53.030 --> 08:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
40% maybe even 45% of his income for
 
08:37:56.548 --> 08:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
rent so it's not an easy Row for him to
 
08:37:59.788 --> 08:37:59.798 align:start position:0%
hoe but he's doing this and he's doing
 
08:38:03.510 --> 08:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
well and he's thriving he has a driver's
 
08:38:06.388 --> 08:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
license what happens when he renews next
 
08:38:12.308 --> 08:38:12.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:12.318 --> 08:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

08:38:15.750 --> 08:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:17.948 --> 08:38:17.958 align:start position:0%
the second part the second part of the
 
08:38:21.070 --> 08:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that is problematic from my
 
08:38:23.788 --> 08:38:23.798 align:start position:0%
perspective is that it
 
08:38:23.798 --> 08:38:25.830 align:start position:0%
perspective is that it
will

08:38:25.830 --> 08:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
08:38:28.750 --> 08:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
take it will require all
 
08:38:32.670 --> 08:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
non-citizens to have their license
 
08:38:36.548 --> 08:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
marked marked them as a
 
08:38:40.270 --> 08:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
non-citizen now here's why this is in my
 
08:38:43.868 --> 08:38:43.878 align:start position:0%
mind an anti-business measure because
 
08:38:46.468 --> 08:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
right now there are lots of people who
 
08:38:49.910 --> 08:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
come to work in businesses who have
 
08:38:51.388 --> 08:38:51.398 align:start position:0%
skills who are
 
08:38:55.270 --> 08:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
non-residents and they are able to do so
 
08:38:56.830 --> 08:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
because they can get their driver's
 
08:38:58.628 --> 08:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
license and they can get around and do
 
08:39:02.030 --> 08:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
the work that needs to be done we
 
08:39:05.628 --> 08:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
have institutions of Higher Learning who
 
08:39:08.270 --> 08:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
are providing education to students who
 
08:39:10.468 --> 08:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
come and they also receive a driver's
 
08:39:13.868 --> 08:39:13.878 align:start position:0%
license under this mechanism they are
 
08:39:15.590 --> 08:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
now going to have to go through
 
08:39:18.308 --> 08:39:18.318 align:start position:0%
additional steps in order and put
 
08:39:20.868 --> 08:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
citizenship on their driver's license I
 
08:39:24.990 --> 08:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
would like to remind the house that we
 
08:39:28.548 --> 08:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
have voted consistently over the
 
08:39:32.788 --> 08:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
years not to accept the concept that
 
08:39:35.190 --> 08:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
there should be a citizenship marker on
 
08:39:37.910 --> 08:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses we have done so
 
08:39:40.990 --> 08:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
consistently because of concerns privacy
 
08:39:44.510 --> 08:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
concerns and so I would urge all of you
 
08:39:49.030 --> 08:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
to um first off Mr Speaker I'll request
 
08:39:51.228 --> 08:39:51.238 align:start position:0%
a division vote on this and I would urge
 
08:39:55.510 --> 08:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
all of my colleagues to uh press the the
 
08:40:00.228 --> 08:40:00.238 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:02.388 --> 08:40:02.398 align:start position:0%
amendment the question before the house
 
08:40:05.150 --> 08:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
is on the adoption of amendment
 
08:40:07.670 --> 08:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
0637 the chair recognizes representative
 
08:40:11.590 --> 08:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:13.708 --> 08:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr
 
08:40:17.190 --> 08:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
speaker uh where to begin uh I'll start
 
08:40:18.708 --> 08:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
up by saying that the previous speaker
 
08:40:21.628 --> 08:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
was correct on what this amendment does
 
08:40:24.110 --> 08:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh and that's the problem that's why we
 
08:40:27.388 --> 08:40:27.398 align:start position:0%
have an amendment because the DMV is
 
08:40:30.190 --> 08:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
actually giving um temporary work
 
08:40:32.190 --> 08:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
authorizations to people with pending
 
08:40:34.948 --> 08:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
Asylum and Refugee cases in spite of the
 
08:40:36.430 --> 08:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
fact that they told me for months that
 
08:40:41.110 --> 08:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
they were not now the bill does uh and
 
08:40:45.030 --> 08:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
I'll get the actual words say that no
 
08:40:49.510 --> 08:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
longer will these work authorizations be
 
08:40:52.868 --> 08:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
recognized now why would we do this well
 
08:40:56.228 --> 08:40:56.238 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe it's me maybe it's
 
08:40:57.830 --> 08:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
got something to do with the millions
 
08:41:01.628 --> 08:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
and millions of people claiming Refugee
 
08:41:03.388 --> 08:41:03.398 align:start position:0%
that are coming across our borders which
 
08:41:05.548 --> 08:41:05.558 align:start position:0%
is going to be equivalent to tens of
 
08:41:07.510 --> 08:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
thousands in the state of New
 
08:41:09.830 --> 08:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maybe it's got something to do
 
08:41:10.910 --> 08:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
with the fact that the current
 
08:41:13.910 --> 08:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
Administration is ignoring uh treaties
 
08:41:16.070 --> 08:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
and agreements we've been in since the
 
08:41:18.030 --> 08:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
at least 50 years called the third safe
 
08:41:20.308 --> 08:41:20.318 align:start position:0%
country agreement which means that only
 
08:41:22.708 --> 08:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
a buding countries are we responsible
 
08:41:25.468 --> 08:41:25.478 align:start position:0%
for accepting refugees you can't jump
 
08:41:27.910 --> 08:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
six you can't get on a plane and fly
 
08:41:29.990 --> 08:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
across the ocean to Mexico and then come
 
08:41:31.868 --> 08:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
here and claim Asylum it's against our
 
08:41:31.878 --> 08:41:32.708 align:start position:0%
here and claim Asylum it's against our
own

08:41:32.708 --> 08:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
own
 
08:41:35.270 --> 08:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
laws maybe it's because because of
 
08:41:37.868 --> 08:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
ignoring our third country agreement
 
08:41:40.670 --> 08:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's reported that over 71% of the
 
08:41:43.670 --> 08:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
refugee claims are not from even from
 
08:41:47.190 --> 08:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
eligible countries of the 29% that are
 
08:41:48.910 --> 08:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
maybe from eligible countries such as
 
08:41:51.910 --> 08:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
Mexico they still need to prove either
 
08:41:55.110 --> 08:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
religious or or or uh political
 
08:41:57.948 --> 08:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
persecution to come here just to seek a
 
08:42:01.030 --> 08:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
better life is not legitimate reason to
 
08:42:03.190 --> 08:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
claim Asylum it's just not there are
 
08:42:05.868 --> 08:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
other avenues for that to
 
08:42:07.948 --> 08:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
happen I'll give you one more reason
 
08:42:10.430 --> 08:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
that might might sway your opinion on
 
08:42:13.270 --> 08:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
why we should be doing this on the
 
08:42:15.510 --> 08:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
southern side of the Mexican border
 
08:42:17.788 --> 08:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
there are tens and tens of thousands of
 
08:42:17.798 --> 08:42:19.308 align:start position:0%
there are tens and tens of thousands of
identities

08:42:19.308 --> 08:42:19.318 align:start position:0%
identities
 
08:42:21.830 --> 08:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
identifications visas passports and
 
08:42:23.990 --> 08:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
currency from right now they're Counting
 
08:42:26.388 --> 08:42:26.398 align:start position:0%
about 180 countries from around the
 
08:42:28.628 --> 08:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
planet why are these people leaving
 
08:42:30.388 --> 08:42:30.398 align:start position:0%
their stuff in Mexico before they come
 
08:42:32.548 --> 08:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
here because they don't want us to know
 
08:42:33.548 --> 08:42:33.558 align:start position:0%
who they
 
08:42:37.110 --> 08:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
are the bottom line is I'm not going to
 
08:42:38.308 --> 08:42:38.318 align:start position:0%
get into the rest of the amendment
 
08:42:39.750 --> 08:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
because this is the Comm the
 
08:42:41.708 --> 08:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
controversial part of it but if you
 
08:42:44.150 --> 08:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
truly believe the driving on our ways is
 
08:42:46.708 --> 08:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
defined as a privilege and a privilege
 
08:42:48.868 --> 08:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
reserved for our low abiding citizens
 
08:42:51.628 --> 08:42:51.638 align:start position:0%
and the visitors or in this case the
 
08:42:53.948 --> 08:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
people that actually are
 
08:42:56.750 --> 08:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
completely uh vetted and adjudicated
 
08:42:59.468 --> 08:42:59.478 align:start position:0%
through the Asylum courts please thank

08:45:46.910 --> 08:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment if I further know that the
 
08:45:48.388 --> 08:45:48.398 align:start position:0%
majority of Asylum claims are from
 
08:45:50.388 --> 08:45:50.398 align:start position:0%
ineligible countries and based on the
 
08:45:52.548 --> 08:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
volume of discarded IDs and currencies
 
08:45:54.510 --> 08:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
at the border that all claims should be
 
08:45:57.110 --> 08:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
adjudicated before P privileges are
 
08:45:59.308 --> 08:45:59.318 align:start position:0%
given if I believe that work
 
08:46:01.030 --> 08:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
authorizations are the way around to the
 
08:46:03.670 --> 08:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
Asylum process which is overwhelming
 
08:46:05.190 --> 08:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
which is overwhelmed by the millions of
 
08:46:07.628 --> 08:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
claims then would I now press the green

08:49:10.030 --> 08:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
going to repeat them but I will bring up
 
08:49:12.750 --> 08:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
one final and additional point relative
 
08:49:15.910 --> 08:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
to the bill as a
 
08:49:20.750 --> 08:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
whole within the Bill's original
 
08:49:24.708 --> 08:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
language I'm sorry he's speaking on the
 
08:49:28.830 --> 08:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
bill I I get to speak that's fine you're
 
08:49:30.910 --> 08:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
fine speak you're speaking on the motion
 
08:49:34.948 --> 08:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
to AO pass as amended yes you're good
 
08:49:37.430 --> 08:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
08:49:40.308 --> 08:49:40.318 align:start position:0%
Speaker so again I'm not going to repeat
 
08:49:43.628 --> 08:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
the previous uh debate on the amendment
 
08:49:45.228 --> 08:49:45.238 align:start position:0%
but I do want to point out that the
 
08:49:48.628 --> 08:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
original bill in its original language
 
08:49:53.308 --> 08:49:53.318 align:start position:0%
did have also a requirement that changed
 
08:49:56.190 --> 08:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
some of the language of how the DMV
 
08:49:56.200 --> 08:49:57.430 align:start position:0%
some of the language of how the DMV
would

08:49:57.430 --> 08:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
08:50:02.150 --> 08:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
process um requests for non-residents to
 
08:50:04.228 --> 08:50:04.238 align:start position:0%
to get their driver's licenses and they
 
08:50:08.948 --> 08:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
changed the language from May to shall
 
08:50:10.910 --> 08:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I would point out that during
 
08:50:12.990 --> 08:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
testimony for that
 
08:50:13.000 --> 08:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
testimony for that
we

08:50:14.150 --> 08:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
08:50:16.868 --> 08:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
heard very
 
08:50:19.548 --> 08:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
determined very
 
08:50:22.628 --> 08:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
forceful language and testimony from the
 
08:50:25.228 --> 08:50:25.238 align:start position:0%
DMV of the problems that that would
 
08:50:28.430 --> 08:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
create for them in administering that
 
08:50:30.590 --> 08:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason alone I would
 
08:50:34.270 --> 08:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
urge the co my colleagues to again I
 
08:50:36.308 --> 08:50:36.318 align:start position:0%
request a division vote and that they
 
08:50:39.468 --> 08:50:39.478 align:start position:0%
would push the red button the question
 
08:50:42.228 --> 08:50:42.238 align:start position:0%
before the house is on the passage as a
 
08:50:44.708 --> 08:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
amended of House Bill 11118 the chair
 
08:50:47.350 --> 08:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Smith uh to
 
08:50:52.228 --> 08:50:52.238 align:start position:0%
 
08:50:54.788 --> 08:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr Speaker this is
 
08:50:58.628 --> 08:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:01.308 --> 08:51:01.318 align:start position:0%
now so what I don't know why I put these
 
08:51:04.270 --> 08:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
on I have nothing to read so here's what
 
08:51:06.590 --> 08:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
happened somebody asked me a question
 
08:51:08.150 --> 08:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
and I looked up a statute unless you
 
08:51:10.990 --> 08:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
have an hour on your hands never do that
 
08:51:13.150 --> 08:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
so I looked at the statute that provides
 
08:51:15.670 --> 08:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
for licenses for people who are here
 
08:51:18.388 --> 08:51:18.398 align:start position:0%
temporarily but legally and there was
 
08:51:21.468 --> 08:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
some problems so it com is comprised
 
08:51:23.110 --> 08:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much of three things one
 
08:51:26.190 --> 08:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
identifying the people it applies to two
 
08:51:28.830 --> 08:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
specific things that DMV should do to
 
08:51:30.190 --> 08:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that they actually know how to
 
08:51:33.190 --> 08:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
drive before we give them a license and
 
08:51:38.228 --> 08:51:38.238 align:start position:0%
three the uh the terms so first these
 
08:51:39.910 --> 08:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
were like if you took these things and
 
08:51:41.868 --> 08:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
put them in a shredder and then pasted
 
08:51:43.350 --> 08:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
them back together out of order they
 
08:51:44.990 --> 08:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
were all over the place you'd have
 
08:51:46.590 --> 08:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
something to identifi the person the
 
08:51:48.468 --> 08:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
next one oh and by the way see if they
 
08:51:50.150 --> 08:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
have a document that shows they know how
 
08:51:52.110 --> 08:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
to drive by the way this applies to
 
08:51:54.590 --> 08:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
people a mess I don't know how it
 
08:51:57.388 --> 08:51:57.398 align:start position:0%
happened but we're going to fix it so
 
08:51:59.708 --> 08:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
what I did was I went through this and
 
08:52:01.750 --> 08:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh the stuff for identifying the people
 
08:52:04.030 --> 08:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
that was easy goes in the first section
 
08:52:05.430 --> 08:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
now we' kind of like to know they know
 
08:52:07.708 --> 08:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
how to drive right how does a director
 
08:52:09.868 --> 08:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
do that well previous legislature went
 
08:52:11.388 --> 08:52:11.398 align:start position:0%
through the trouble to identify like
 
08:52:12.628 --> 08:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
five different things things that the
 
08:52:15.670 --> 08:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
director may look at doesn't say he
 
08:52:17.228 --> 08:52:17.238 align:start position:0%
actually has to do any of them so he
 
08:52:19.030 --> 08:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
took the time to identify these five
 
08:52:20.670 --> 08:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
things and then the director can look at
 
08:52:23.190 --> 08:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
it and go nah to much trouble and move
 
08:52:26.270 --> 08:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
on not good enough so now it does say
 
08:52:28.350 --> 08:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
that they have to do at least one of
 
08:52:31.110 --> 08:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
these things now the DMV director was
 
08:52:33.750 --> 08:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that some nefarious director
 
08:52:35.830 --> 08:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
would pick the hardest of these five
 
08:52:37.830 --> 08:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
things you know to kind of make it
 
08:52:39.110 --> 08:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
really hard for these folks to get
 
08:52:43.150 --> 08:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
licenses he can do that now matter fact
 
08:52:46.190 --> 08:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
this is it's the way it's uh labeled he
 
08:52:48.830 --> 08:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
may do all five of them now he can only
 
08:52:52.788 --> 08:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
do one that's better not worse so we
 
08:52:56.150 --> 08:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
reorganized the statute um some of these
 
08:52:58.190 --> 08:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
folks who are here legally might not
 
08:53:00.270 --> 08:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
have a Social Security number there was
 
08:53:01.948 --> 08:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
no carve out for the statute that
 
08:53:04.990 --> 08:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
explicitly requires one that's been
 
08:53:07.830 --> 08:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
fixed they're here temporarily I know a
 
08:53:09.430 --> 08:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
tech company that I worked for we would
 
08:53:12.628 --> 08:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
get engineers in from overseas like two
 
08:53:14.708 --> 08:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
years why would you want them to have an
 
08:53:17.228 --> 08:53:17.238 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license well because our
 
08:53:18.750 --> 08:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company on the company
 
08:53:20.590 --> 08:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
Vehicles was a lot happier if they had
 
08:53:23.628 --> 08:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licenses so it makes good
 
08:53:26.228 --> 08:53:26.238 align:start position:0%
business sense to do this the bill also
 
08:53:29.110 --> 08:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
now requires that if they show a 2-year
 
08:53:31.830 --> 08:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
Visa their New Hampshire license going
 
08:53:33.628 --> 08:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
to be good for two years the director
 
08:53:35.910 --> 08:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
has to sync up the duration of the New
 
08:53:37.548 --> 08:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license with the duration of
 
08:53:40.150 --> 08:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
their stay so it cleans it up it just
 
08:53:41.468 --> 08:53:41.478 align:start position:0%
makes good sense and I hope you can
 
08:53:43.228 --> 08:53:43.238 align:start position:0%
support it thank you Mr
 
08:53:46.070 --> 08:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker the question before the house is
 
08:53:47.948 --> 08:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
on the motion of ought to pass as
 
08:53:49.830 --> 08:53:49.840 align:start position:0%

faith effort to try and clean up the

about the efforts that he was making but

I also know that two very difficult and
 
08:55:20.990 --> 08:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
for me problematic amendments were added
 
08:55:24.628 --> 08:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
to that bill that go into all of the
 
08:55:27.510 --> 08:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
things that I talked about where uh a

pilot of the
 
09:05:51.070 --> 09:05:51.080 align:start position:0%

09:05:53.830 --> 09:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
Dover um I didn't think I knew Jack
 
09:05:57.070 --> 09:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
Casey and indeed I didn't but I know his
 
09:06:00.708 --> 09:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
father and his sorry his uncle and his

obituary which I cleared with his
 
09:06:10.310 --> 09:06:10.320 align:start position:0%

09:06:13.228 --> 09:06:13.238 align:start position:0%
appreciate being done
