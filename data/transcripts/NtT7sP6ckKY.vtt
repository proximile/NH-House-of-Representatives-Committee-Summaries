three Parcels of state-owned land to 36

Hors Point Road in the town of Belmont
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
we're asking that the committee um allow
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
us to Grant this easement uh at no cost
 
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
to the grantee and to wave the $1,100
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
administrative fee the purpose of which
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
is this is really housekeeping item back
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the 70s the department started to
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
acquire property uh to build the
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
Franklin Laconia
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
bypass um abing this land and from the
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
grante predecessor and interest the
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
apartment the department acquired
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
property which then severed the subject
 
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
parcel or the grante parcel from Route
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
three uh to remedy this we allowed the
 
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh the property owner to to still use an
 
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
existing gravel driveway across the
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
corridor and this this um permission was
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
immortalized in the late 90s with I
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
believe what was an access agreement or
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
an encroachment agreement which was
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
subsequently recorded in the bellnap
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
County registry of
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
deeds and uh the intent of that was at a
 
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
later point when the road was built if
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
this would grant them um we would grant
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
them a permanent access easement and
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
this was in the encroachment agreement
 
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
we would grant them a permanent access
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
easement onto the new Corridor and at
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
any point in the future if the town
 
00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919 align:start position:0%
built the beach access road which it has
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
since which it since has at the
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
Department's expense we would um build
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
an access road to the beach access road
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
from the grantees parcel uh and that was
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
to um make the property owner whole from
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
having to go through the time and
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
expense of building an access point to
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the new road um and for the safety of
 
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
the traveling public moving that the
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
department would incur that so because
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
the road was never built the property
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
owner never had to go through that time
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
and expense but now they're asking for
 
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
the um access to be to the beach Road
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
and that's best and that best serves the
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
traveling public at that point that's
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
why we're asking to Grant it at no cost
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's just basically cleaning up the
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork removing this will this will
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
void the temporary encroachment and
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
access agreement and inl give the uh
 
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.240 align:start position:0%

improved when the department purchased
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
them back in the early 80s um the two
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
the two Parcels together uh combined are

limited access um although they are
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
considered uh independently marketable
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
we thought that they would probably it
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
was a broader Market if we combined the
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%

to build the north south local Road
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%

$396,500

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
$396,500
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
uh since we have uh submitted this item
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
um the town has shown some interest in
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
the parcel
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%

believe uh this parcel will be sold
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's to the town of Conway or
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Housing Authority we
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
doubt that it will actually reach the
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
open market the New Hampshire Housing
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
to use or Express that it wants to use
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
the property for affordable housing uh
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire uh the town of Conway has
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
um expressed that they have some other
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
uses for it as well or some interest in
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
other uses for it as well so I can
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
answer any other
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
questions question before are you going
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
to call for a motion no question yes
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
please so so that right now it's your
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
request is in either or either the town
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
or New Hampshire Finance Authority if it
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to either of those will you
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
be back here to put it on the open
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
market or is this also a motion to put
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
it on the open market if those two fall
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
through well that's a good that's a good
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
question that that I'll be C that I
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
haven't considered yet I would think we
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
would have to come back to get approval
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the realtor we use on the open
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
you um further
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
questions repres please Chet from the
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
LBA I'm not sure they would necessarily
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
have to come back what the committee is
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
doing is providing the department the
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
authority to dispose of the land the
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
first step is to see if the city or town
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the land's located in would want it
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
then they would move forward with the
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
how they would go about a disposal they
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
also go through governor and counsel
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
through that process so I I'm not sure
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
that they would have to come back they
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
could come back as an informational just
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
to let you know that
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
um what they hadn't told you might
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
happen isn't actually going to happen
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's something else that you know
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to put it through a
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
realtor and then sell it that way but I
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that because what
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
you're providing Authority for is to
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
dispose of the property not how they
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
dispose of it because in the statute it
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
has the the mechanism that they're to
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
follow yep followup Senator well again
 
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
my question was because I know on 25 we
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
just approved it was specific to a
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
realtor that was in in in The Proposal
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
about disposing of the land in conquer
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I was asking a
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
question where this is like no we're g
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
to give it to it's going to be sold
 
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to the town but they don't
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
re that's all I was that's why I was
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
asking well the the approval you made on
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
that previous item is is again to
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
dispose of the land what the department
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
has provided is additional information
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
as to how they were going to go about
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
that process they're going to use a
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
realtor because they don't have somebody
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
that was going to buy it right off you
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
know already decided they didn't have
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody that wanted to purchase it but
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
they do know they want to get rid of the
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
property but again I just wanted to
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that the authority of the
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee is just to allow the the
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
agency to dispose of the property the
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
other information is there for the
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee to as they make their decision
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
on whether they want to let the dispose
 
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
on whether they want to let the dispose
the

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%

want to make sure that's a real value
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
and that we haven't cut the value for
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
that property so how this would work is
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
again if it went that route we're
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
probably talking a year or two away from
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
now so what we would end up doing is we
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
would go to we would put out requesting
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
market analysis with the Realtors from
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
that region they would come in with
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
various numbers uh we would would
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
analyze those numbers internally and
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
pick our realtor based not always on the
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
highest number but what we think is the
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
most realistic so it's a chance that
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
number would change meaning likely it's
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
GNA only go up right but um is's a
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
chance that number would change but go
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
up so okay Senator fine with that yeah
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that again I know I know
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
Conway's in desperate need of housing
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
right now so I'm completely okay with
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
this and if you're ready for a motion
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'll make yes I am move to approve uh
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%

purchased um and used to build the north
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%

buildings um two existing condo
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
buildings were in much better shape plus
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
there were other buildings that were
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
raised to make room for the north south
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
road so that's why you're seeing a
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
different we we were buying improved
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
land where now we have two buildings
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
that I I don't believe uh necessarily
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
give much value to the property um so
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
that's why you're seeing the difference
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%

followup or clarify yes please so the
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
difference between the 1.3 that we
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
bought it at and the 1.04 we're selling
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
it at is a there was some land shaved
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
off to make way for the roadway in
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
addition there were additional roads
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
that were on there so it's a little bit
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
smaller parcel and there's less
 
00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039 align:start position:0%

value to I believe what is three part
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
what is three Butters so when it became
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
when it was valued um it was valued as
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
part of a larger parcel method um it
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
really has no value on the open market
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
because it has no access to any internal
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%

following the first 10 years there will

be a lesie option for two more 5-year
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
lease agreements at which point the
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
state would then own the cell tower so
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
Federal Hill right now all the equipment
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
is on the fire tower so the antennas and
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
then we have an older concrete
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
Communications building at the bottom of
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
the tower housing all of us so that
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
would all get cleaned up the towers will
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
the antennas will come off of the fire
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
tower which is slated to get rehab next
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
year and the fenced in area will then
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
contain all the equipment on concrete
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
paths so it cleans up the area for
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
people hiking up there puts it in one
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
section the fire tower goes back to
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
normal so we feel it's a a good deal for
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
the for the state for dncr if if I could
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
on these these pay schedules for X
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
number of years yes is that similar to
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
other locations you've done previously
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
yes currently they're a tenant there now
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
so this next fiscal year would kick off
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
their 3% increase for what they're
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
currently paying now but this does
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
mirror what we're doing in other
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
with a garage um the Riverside Drive
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
property is um has been used it's a old
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
cap has been used for uh storage mostly
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
um when it references uh in the document
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
attached garage it's actually just the
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
foundation Remains the other part is
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
fallen down and we've taken care of that
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
both properties uh are in dire need of
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
um um work and uh this would help the
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
college by disposing of the property and
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
not have to to maintain these
 
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
properties we we request the commission
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
to sell this property thank you Mr Moore
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
questions yes Senator just to be clear
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
that it looks like both these Parcels
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
were acquired by the community college
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
but no cost as a grant from a private
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
individual that was given to the
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
Community College and now we're
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
disposing of them because you have no
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
use for them that is correct that's
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
correct right now it's uh it's really an
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
upkeep of you know we don't want to
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
throw good money at bad both the proper
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
properties are are in disarray we're
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
using them as cold storage we no longer
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
have that need and they were a gift to
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
the college thank you Senator before I
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%

government we understand where that
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
