both agencies should have been punished
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%

but the whole situation was
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized by legislators who
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
defeated it
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
we need to make amendments for the
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%

i i think that might have been uh why
yeah

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm representative norman silber i'm
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
from belknap district 2
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
which are the towns of meredith and
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
guilford meredith was the epicenter of
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
this fraud
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the whole lakes region as well as
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
other parts of the state
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
saw lots of their citizens suffer as a
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
result of this fraud it was the biggest
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
financial fraud in the history of new
 
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.470 align:start position:0%
financial fraud in the history of new
hampshire

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
estimated to be a losses of about 80
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to look back and
 
00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to look back and
see

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
who lost money were these investors
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
sophisticated investors the clear answer
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
is no
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
they were the average mom and pop who
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
thought that they were solicited
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
to make safe investments and when they
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
checked with the government agencies in
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
who were responsible for regulating frm
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
constantly assured and reassured that
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
this was a legitimate
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh honest enterprise and that their
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
investments would probably be just fine
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
as it turned out that was not the case
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
so we had basically three
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
departments involved in this oversight
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
uh its operation that turned out to be a
 
00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:43.910 align:start position:0%
uh its operation that turned out to be a
fraud

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
the banking department the bureau of
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
securities regulation and the attorney
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
to characterize any of them or each of
 
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.189 align:start position:0%
to characterize any of them or each of
them

00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
as toothless tigers would be an insult
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
to tigers they either through
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
incompetence inattention negligence
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
or collusion allow this fraud to go on
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
for many many years to the detriment of
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
lots of our citizens
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
these people lost lots of money in many
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
cases their life savings
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
the citizens of our state i believe have
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
a right to rely
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
on regulations of highly regulated
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
industries such as frm
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
if if you're investing money and putting
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
money into a highly regulated state
 
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.470 align:start position:0%
money into a highly regulated state
regulated

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
agency uh enterprise i think it's
 
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.790 align:start position:0%
agency uh enterprise i think it's
reasonable

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
to assume that these agencies are doing
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
and these agencies were not doing their
 
00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:44.230 align:start position:0%
and these agencies were not doing their
jobs

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
so basically a lot of people lost their
 
00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
so basically a lot of people lost their
money

00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
some people were able to only as far as
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
i know only one person went to jail
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
one person was permitted to take a
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
retirement probably getting a retirement
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
pension to to this day there were
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
all sorts of allegations of collusion
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
family relationships leading to some of
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
the highest
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
officers and officials in the state
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
so this is a really a black stain on new
 
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.350 align:start position:0%
so this is a really a black stain on new
hampshire's

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
financial history and on the history of
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire government
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
the the bill seeks 10 million dollars
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
which will not make people whole
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
it will give them a little bit of
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
something the legislature passed
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
the statute establishing this recovery
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
fund which of course has never been
 
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:34.950 align:start position:0%
fund which of course has never been
funded

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
and this is an effort to fund that i
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
have a suggestion of where can we get
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollars
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
let's take it from the budgets of the
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
banking department and the bureau of
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
securities regulation
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
because they clearly
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
do not know how to utilize their funding
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
anywhere that they have used taxpayer
 
00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:57.909 align:start position:0%
anywhere that they have used taxpayer
dollars

00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the victims of the ponzi
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
scheme i am not aware of that no
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
well neither am i and as far as i know
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
none of the 600 in the last decade or
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
the hundreds before that have ever used
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes mike my question is um
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
is this as sponsor
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
is this the only time that you're going
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
to ask for money
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
or is this just the beginning of
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
uh requesting money from
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
the um the state i believe this is the
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
only time i'm not aware of any
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
plans for any subsequent requests
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the legislation establishing the
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
recovery fund limits the recovery
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
to 50 cents on the dollar i don't think
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
this 10 million dollars will even cover
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
50 cents on the dollar
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
but i do i'm not aware of any subsequent
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
any plans for any subsequent requests
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
if if let me just add if this
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh operation the frm had been audited
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being audited by the state
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
agencies had been audited by a reputable
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
cpa firm
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the the cpa firm did not catch the
 
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.789 align:start position:0%
and the the cpa firm did not catch the
fraud

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
the cpa firm would have been sued in a
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
class action on behalf of all the
 
00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:21.909 align:start position:0%
class action on behalf of all the
investors

00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
investors
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
their insurance would have come forth
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
with a payment far in excess probably
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
closer to
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
you know 80 90 cents maybe even 100
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
cents on the dollar but this is not
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's not the case that would they were
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
not audited by far as i know by a
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
reputable cpa firm they were supposedly
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
audited by our state agencies
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh no that's fine thank you thank you
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative leishman you have your

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony sir
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh there were a number of court cases
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
involving this uh
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
if you will scandal have all of them
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
been settled or dispensed with
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
or you know the status i do not know the
 
00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:02.710 align:start position:0%
or you know the status i do not know the
status

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thanks thanks madam chair
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative hatch you
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
were next
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair thank
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
and thanks for the testimony and i think
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
part of my query and concern was just
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
brought out by the fact that
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh the last testifier stated that had
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
there been a reputable cpr audit firm
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
to go through the books of this firm
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
um the and allowed to exist and go on
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
they would have been held liable now
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
that goes back
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
to my um thought that i've heard several
 
00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.230 align:start position:0%
to my um thought that i've heard several
times

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
how everybody did their due diligence
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you're you're taking a risk
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
when you invest something and part of
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
that risk to mitigate it are
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
part of what you need to do to mitigate
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
that risk is take a deep dive
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
into what's going on within a firm and i
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody really
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
exhibited in my mind anyways
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
due diligence because that in fact
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
as just stated was not done
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
now many of us at this table
 
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.950 align:start position:0%
now many of us at this table
representative

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
many of us aren't sophisticated
 
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
many of us aren't sophisticated
investors

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
investors
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
but i'll tell you what um before i
 
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:30.789 align:start position:0%
but i'll tell you what um before i
invest

00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
invest
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
that's part of what i do so i i just i'm
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
sorry i just need to
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
answer or hear
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
what else was done in terms of due
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
diligence were profiles looked at
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
by clients what was going on clients
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
et cetera thank you madam chair what was
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
done as far as due diligence was
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
they the investors many times contacted
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
these different state agencies
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
to either inquire or to raise complaints
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
and they were constantly reassured
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
that everything was okay with them and
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
there's a long history going back
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
many years over the course of this fraud
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
that they did contact state agencies
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
that was the only way that they could do
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
due diligence was to contact the state
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
agencies because they were
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
investing in a company that was
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
supposedly in a highly regulated
 
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.029 align:start position:0%
supposedly in a highly regulated
industry

00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up question
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative hatch well
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
i i again i i think my question wasn't
 
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:26.950 align:start position:0%
i i again i i think my question wasn't
answered

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
i asked um did the people look at the
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
profiles of the clients
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
and and let me put this in perspective
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
there there are a lot of
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
investment opportunities that aren't
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
insured by the fdic
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
that are similar to what happened here
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
in this ponzi scheme
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
that are legitimate i had a minor in a
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
minor way participate in one
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
but the information i needed to do my
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
due diligence
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
was available and had it not been
 
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
was available and had it not been
available

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
had i looked at this similar
 
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.350 align:start position:0%
had i looked at this similar
circumstance

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe i would have been
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
doing my due diligence
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
and that's a bad on me not a bad on the
 
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
and that's a bad on me not a bad on the
state

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
and again to just rely on a state agency
 
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.630 align:start position:0%
and again to just rely on a state agency
alone

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
tells me that that wasn't done if there
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
was suspicion there
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
there were other venues other things
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
that needed to be done
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
by the investors to protect themselves
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
when you invest
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
you have to protect yourself
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't done thank you madam
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
chair all right i can't hear where that
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
was done
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
like and i'm sorry to take up so much
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
time but i think this is important
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
i asked what were some of the clients
 
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
i asked what were some of the clients
profiles

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
profiles
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
people that invest in something like
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
that get that information
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
before they invest and i haven't heard
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
from one person
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
and all the testimonies and i feel bad
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
for these people
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
but i haven't heard from one that this
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
activity took place
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
and so i'm sorry investor beware thank
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%

the question was what was the profile of
 
00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:10.630 align:start position:0%
the question was what was the profile of
the

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
different people that uh borrowed these
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
funds that's part of due diligence
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
what were their ficas what were their
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
history uh what was what was a payment
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
schedule by this company
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh when i invested in has a less than
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
one percent default rate
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
having uh having experienced personally
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
in my family
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
my father lost money in a mortgage fraud
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
not frm but in another mortgage fraud
 
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
not frm but in another mortgage fraud
scheme

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
scheme
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i also represented a a judge who
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
lost money in a mortgage fraud scheme
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
these things happen with some degree of
 
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.390 align:start position:0%
these things happen with some degree of
regularity

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
regularity
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
and it's usually people who are not very
 
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.390 align:start position:0%
and it's usually people who are not very
sophisticated

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
sophisticated
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh they don't they rely upon the state
 
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.830 align:start position:0%
uh they don't they rely upon the state
regulators

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
regulators
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
and each of these in each of those cases
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
the mortgage companies with whom they
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
place their money as
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
investments were in a highly regulated
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
industry by the state
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
and they relied on the state regulation
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
and auditing
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that these these
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
operations were being run
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
legitimately and were not frauds and
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
they completely in this case
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%

one two three one question
representative

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
can you hear me you've been called on to
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
testify representative
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
can you okay so i can't tell if you can
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%

um i'll go ahead edwards just in case
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
you don't know when you're unmuted we
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
can hear you so we've been hearing you
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know how mute and unmute work on
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
this microphone madam chair
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
so that's why i was asking i'm going to
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
assume you can hear me and this is
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question and a follow-up
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
the question uh stipulates for the
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of the question
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the investors relied
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
materially upon the attestations
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
of senior government employees
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
that the fund was legitimate so so with
 
00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
that the fund was legitimate so so with
that

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
context uh representative silber
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
um i want to ask you about sovereign
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
immunity if
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
if our state actors had been merely
 
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.269 align:start position:0%
if our state actors had been merely
incompetent

00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
incompetent
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
would we have a reasonable
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
argument to rely on sovereign immunity
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
to save the taxpayer the 10 million
 
00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
to save the taxpayer the 10 million
dollars

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i don't know the
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
i've never explored the concept of
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity in the case of this
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
egregious fraud
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay may i ask a follow-up man i'm sure
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh and then uh on the other side of the
 
00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:12.230 align:start position:0%
uh and then uh on the other side of the
coin

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
coin
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
would the ethics of the state relying on
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
shift if it were
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
believed that the senior state actors
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
had intentionally acted in a corrupt
 
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.870 align:start position:0%
had intentionally acted in a corrupt
manner

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and intentionally misled the public
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
would would the ethics
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
of relying on sovereign immunity shift
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
to where it would be unethical to hide
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
behind that shield
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think from
 
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.549 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think from
a

00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a moralistic and a
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
philosophical perspective
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
of course the ethics would shift but i
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
in sovereign immunity ethics plays much
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
of a role
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
i think that either there's sovereign
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
immunity or there's not i haven't
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
explored the case law in a situation
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
but the the actions that i've read about
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
and and have done the research on as far
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
as what took place
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
by these departments involved and we're
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
so egregious that
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
to hide behind the shield of sovereign
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
immunity if that's what they want to try
 
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:13.990 align:start position:0%
immunity if that's what they want to try
to

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
play that card is is an insult to this
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answers thank you
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%

director of
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
charitable trust at the attorney
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
general's office and thank you members
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
of the committee for allowing me to
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
um the attorney general's office is not
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill one way
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
um but my position the director of
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
charitable trust
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
is named in the underlying statute
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
to appoint a
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
a person to administer the fund it's
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
it would be my responsibility to hire
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
the person
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
and to provide supervision in that
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
regard so i have some familiarity with
 
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.669 align:start position:0%
regard so i have some familiarity with
it

00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
um this uh statute
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
rsa 359 p
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
passed in 2016 and pursuant to that i
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
went out
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
and tried to find an administrator
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
i advertised in business and legal
 
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.389 align:start position:0%
i advertised in business and legal
publications

00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
publications
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
got a couple of nibbles uh interviewed a
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
couple of people and i thought i had one
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
person on the hook
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the end that person declined
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
because part of the responsibility of
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
the administrator was
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
to refine the money to raise the money
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
that that administrator would then use
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
distribute in accordance with the
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
formula in the statute
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
um and then the administrator would only
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
be paid no more than 10 percent of
 
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
be paid no more than 10 percent of
whatever

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
he or she was able to raise that
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
financial arrangement
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
was not appetizing um
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
to anyone and so that was the end of it
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
um so i i understand again not taking
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
position that this is an attempt to
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
provide the funding
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
um that perhaps would make it uh more
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
attractive to
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
find an administrator who would be
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
compensated from the fund
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
i want to point out though that there is
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
a section in the current statute
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
that says the administrator can only be
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
compensated from
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
private dollars that go into the fund
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
if the if the legislature makes an
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's public dollars
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't solve the problem
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
of uh finding money um that the
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
that the administrator from which the
 
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
that the administrator from which the
legislator

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
sure could be paid so you need to
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
um i i believe the other issue
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh is and um i think
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative umberger asked a
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
question if there were any other
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislation relating to uh finding
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh money for this fund i note that sb
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
127 that's one of those omnibus bills
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
over in the senate
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
has a provision that the fund
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be um uh
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
compensated would receive up to five
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
dollars a year from the investors
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
education fund
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
which i think is a fund that um comes
 
00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
which i think is a fund that um comes
from

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
fines that the uh securities bureau
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
wages uh raises um and so
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's an alternative and you you have
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
how these two bills would um
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh marry up to each other so those are
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
those are my only comments
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
and and i cannot speak if in case people
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
have questions about
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
the underlying um unfortunate
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances with the investors i i
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that i
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't at the attorney general's office
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm in charitable trust we are not
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
involved with
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh securities or consumer protection we
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
we've we're in our own niche and
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
um um somehow
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh our our bureau was uh tasked to
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with the administrator so i
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
can't i can't answer the specifics of
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
on on any of that stuff but happy to
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
mr donovan thank you for testifying this
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
morning i was in finance in 2016 when
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
that bill passed
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
we were told at the time and i know you
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
weren't in the
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
hearings when we had it but we were told
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
at the time that the bill sponsors
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
who were no longer in the legislature
 
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
who were no longer in the legislature
had

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
private dollars ready to step forward to
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
fill that fund
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
which of course as you just testified
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
did not happen so we passed that
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
legislation in good faith
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for reminding us that
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
the payment is only from private dollars
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that i was aware
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%

and this funding of this very important
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
state and local partnership will
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
continue to apply well into
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
the future hb 398 is a
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
as a step forward a step toward

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
um no i do not see him
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the list online we may come up again
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
on 4
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
12. we have a lot of people that wanted
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
to testify on both
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
bills or sent us letters concerning both
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
um let's see if he's down here yes he's
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
down here also
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the next bill next bill
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
412 this one is on drinking water the
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
next one is on waste water
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
so a lot of these kind of go together
 
00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:04.950 align:start position:0%
so a lot of these kind of go together
and

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
trying to keep everything healthy
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
so going over the list again
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
and i read it wrong i apologize it did
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
show that there were a total to testify
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
of three
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
that there was support 21 in support and
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
zero opposed on
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
house bill excuse me 398.
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that will be looked at in the budget
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think that the reason the money got
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
left out last time was something that
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
happened in the senate i'm pretty sure
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
put money in those rotating uh
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
revolving funds when it left the house
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
but they obviously didn't get put in
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
so we've got a few more minutes to uh
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
before we have the 10 o'clock
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you all uh
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
we will probably exact these bills
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
next tuesday uh 10 o'clock look okay for
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
everybody to do another one of these
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
zoom meetings i can't see driving up
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
there for a
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
short meeting but if we can all
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
be together again at 10 o'clock next
 
00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:20.470 align:start position:0%
be together again at 10 o'clock next
tuesday

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to execute these bills
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
what we've done in the past on the
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
we'll have a bunch of bills that come to
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
us before we finish the budget
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
if they're supported by the committee
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
we'll try to work them into the budget
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
and obviously these
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
drinking water and wastewater bills have
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
been supported in the past and i expect
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
they will be again
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
be a matter where we fit them in the
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
the frm we previous budget we put that
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
in as well
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
and subsequently it was removed by
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
others but
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens that's uh that's
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
the way we do it with
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
with bills that come before us before we
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
finally get to the budget
 
00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:11.750 align:start position:0%
finally get to the budget
and

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
that is the likely outcome but if we're
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
going to do that we have to have a
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
meeting we have to exact we have to
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh mark these bills as retained
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
then if we get them in the budget all
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
retained bills come up later after our
 
00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:27.030 align:start position:0%
retained bills come up later after our
session

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then the retained bills if they've
 
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.150 align:start position:0%
and then the retained bills if they've
been

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the budget the
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
original bill becomes mutant we just in
 
00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.630 align:start position:0%
original bill becomes mutant we just in
expedient

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
expedient
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
the bill after we've taken care of that
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
i see a hand up from
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative hatch representative
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
hatch you're recognized
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead non-mute yourself i i'm sorry
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair i
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
i didn't mean to do that oh
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
no problem we still got a few minutes to
 
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
no problem we still got a few minutes to
uh

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about things if uh there's
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
anybody has anything that
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to see if jess edwards is
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
still in
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
the big room yes there he is hello hello
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
what are you viewing from your position
 
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.630 align:start position:0%
what are you viewing from your position
there

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
um i i see
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
long tables all the way down on both
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
sides this could easily sit
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
13 people with social distancing there's
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
three of these um they're not hvac
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
literally but they're the air
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
handling systems to handle uh a
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
decon of the air um
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a beautiful day with the
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
sun streaming through the big windows
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
and uh i wish there were people here to
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
to visit with
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
but uh it's it's i think it's a nice
 
00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:47.510 align:start position:0%
but uh it's it's i think it's a nice
setup

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
setup
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
for a division meeting certainly it
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
would be easy to get seven people in
 
00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:52.470 align:start position:0%
would be easy to get seven people in
here

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
where everyone could be comfortable do
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
you see anything on screens
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah no the screen is approximately uh
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
20 feet away from me they have some
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
physical uh
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
cabling issues that keep it from being
 
00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.150 align:start position:0%
cabling issues that keep it from being
brought

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
forward more but it's it's about 20
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
feet from me i see the same zoom
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
stuff that you see on your home monitor
 
00:56:17.359 --> 00:56:17.829 align:start position:0%
stuff that you see on your home monitor
the

00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh i don't have a keyboard with me to to
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
do the mute and unmute
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the mute and unmute are controlled
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
from uh the microphone which
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's just not intuitive you have to
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
press red
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
to talk usually red means don't but
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
so um so with a little bit of training i
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
think it's easy to use the microphone
 
00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:41.109 align:start position:0%
think it's easy to use the microphone
too

00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
well we look forward at some point to uh
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
either being in that room for
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
divisions or i guess they're working out
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
some kinks over in rep's hall that for
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
the full committee to meet there there's
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
enough separation
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
i noticed they have some desks involved
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
with mics by each desk
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
that they when they had the senate there
 
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:02.789 align:start position:0%
that they when they had the senate there
so

00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
reps hall is a possibility for us to
 
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.309 align:start position:0%
reps hall is a possibility for us to
meet

00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm still hearing there's problems
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
working out with the
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
sound system so there are many
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
committees that will probably meet there
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll find out how they
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
they work that out and i'm sitting in
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
your chair it's very comfortable
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
i won't get used to it though
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
all right very good um so
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
at some point we'll be uh meeting in
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
that room for divisions
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
and later on we'll be in the reps hall
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
for the full committee i hope we all can
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
make it and
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
if we have enough bills and obviously
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
there for the uh for the some of the
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
budget hearings
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
we hear from everybody but most of that
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
work will be done in divisions
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
so we've only got a couple of minutes to
 
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.589 align:start position:0%
so we've only got a couple of minutes to
go

00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
and does anybody else have anything to
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
add as far as these sessions or
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
the bills we have before us we're going
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
to have 412 next
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
and we could be getting in position for
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
that and again that's uh representative
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
bucco will be presenting that as the
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the same people we may see
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
mr hansel on this one
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess we have uh let's see
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
four people to testify
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
and we'll hope that we see them all some
 
00:58:31.839 --> 00:58:33.349 align:start position:0%
and we'll hope that we see them all some
uh

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
becky benvenuto will see it benvenuti
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we'll see a bill hansel this
 
00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:42.150 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we'll see a bill hansel this
time

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
so another minute we'll get started on
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative this is mike kane uh from
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%

uh so you see an example of rep edwards
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
in division three
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
so for division start yes so for
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%

have access to a very uh hopefully short
 
01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:39.829 align:start position:0%
have access to a very uh hopefully short
concise

01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
concise
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh letter of testimony that we submitted

late yesterday
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to do is take a couple
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
minutes just briefly to maybe put this
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
concept into perspectives that we can
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand you know this concept of
 
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.470 align:start position:0%
understand you know this concept of
funding

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
our drinking water funding our waste
 
01:02:56.799 --> 01:02:59.349 align:start position:0%
our drinking water funding our waste
water

01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
by the way you've heard from becky
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from her again and if you
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
hear from bill
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
you'll get more details and expertise
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
than i can bring to the table but this
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
is what i wanted to share with you
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
um water of course is essential
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
i think anybody that's lost power or
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
been without water for more than a day
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
or so
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
realizes that um
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
however because we have such a
 
01:03:24.079 --> 01:03:25.109 align:start position:0%
however because we have such a
dependable

01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
dependable
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
public drinking water system and such
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
amazing people
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
that operate these systems we we take
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
water for granted
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
um to one degree or another but most of
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
us just turn on the tap and it's there
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
and it's always there
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
um again that's because we have
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
remarkable people
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh teams of professionals treating and
 
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.390 align:start position:0%
uh teams of professionals treating and
distributing

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
distributing
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
our drinking water the costs
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
for this clean water for the service
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we take for granted
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
really are not well understood
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
i live in concord uh my combined water
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
sewer bill
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
is 25 bucks a month that includes
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
administrative costs i think five bucks
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
for water 10 bucks for sewer
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
i would bet most of us spend more than
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
that on coffee or a cocktail
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
but what goes into delivering that clean
 
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.109 align:start position:0%
but what goes into delivering that clean
water

01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
are large multi-million dollar projects
 
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
are large multi-million dollar projects
of

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
treatment plants water supply protection
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
miles of pipe to distribute it
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of tests a year to make sure
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's safe
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
ongoing training to make sure that as
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
these new standards like pfas or
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
manganese or arsenic
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
now lead copper is coming up all these
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
standards that evolve
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
we treat our water again so people take
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
water for granted it's delivered
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
pretty much flawlessly but most of us
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
don't understand where it comes from or
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
what it costs
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're hidden systems uh the state aid
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
grant which is
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
what this legislation supports refunding
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know re uh re-uh
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
don't mean refund you know what i mean
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
allocating funds
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
to uh truly does leverage on other
 
01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
to uh truly does leverage on other
funding

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this primary
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
primarily helps
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
with debt service which is a huge part
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
of a multi-million dollar multi-year
 
01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.190 align:start position:0%
of a multi-million dollar multi-year
project

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
being able to count on it and i just
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
heard this from
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
a colleague that runs the water system
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
in concord
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
my city put in a multi-million dollar
 
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
my city put in a multi-million dollar
project

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
expecting support from the state a grant
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
12 years ago and as i believe hasn't
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
received anything yet
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
so the point that this is statutorily
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
called for
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
and pledged and yet the fact it has not
 
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.670 align:start position:0%
and pledged and yet the fact it has not
been

01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh funded to me is
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
is an issue that this this group can
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
address and this legislation can address
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
um so to sort of sum things up
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
i think again we know this but i want to
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
remind us that this is what
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're working on is clean water
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
and properly treated waste water are all
 
01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:08.870 align:start position:0%
and properly treated waste water are all
about

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
human health as one of our guys once
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
said uh in the industry
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
um our product goes in people's mouths
 
01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:16.470 align:start position:0%
um our product goes in people's mouths
it's

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's very much health related it's very
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
much economic
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh a driver and it's a priority to
 
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.150 align:start position:0%
uh a driver and it's a priority to
invest

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
invest
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
invest not hand out but invest wisely
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
for effective resilient and sustainable
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
and wastewater infrastructure so
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
our bottom line is we fully support
 
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.670 align:start position:0%
our bottom line is we fully support
governmental

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
governmental
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
at the state national level investment
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
in critical infrastructure and drinking
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
water and wastewater
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
are all of that we urge you to support
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
and our association and our many members
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%

have public and private partnerships to
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%

or later if i have to research them and
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
i look forward to working

representative edwards has a question
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
sir representative edwards
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you mr chair and um i
 
01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:43.829 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you mr chair and um i
have

01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
historically lived where there's been
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
public uh
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
water supplies and it it's only been
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
since moving to new hampshire it's made
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
me want to ask someone the question
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
of if there's a community that is really
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
living off of its wells and all three of
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
my towns do auburn chester and sandown
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
no public water there what
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
is the rationale for the citizens of
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
auburn chester and sandown
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
to contributing to public water
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh projects that they get no benefit
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
from and
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and and plus they're getting double
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
dipped because they have to pay for
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
their own wells
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
too so i i i don't have an
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh a predisposed answer i'm looking for
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
it's just been a question i've had
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
kicking around in my head is
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know how does how should the donor
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
system work
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
is that i'm sorry sir is that a question
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
to me or
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh i hope so he's looking for
 
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.149 align:start position:0%
uh i hope so he's looking for
justification

01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
justification
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
why public funds should go to uh
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
to help support water systems that
 
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.430 align:start position:0%
to help support water systems that
perhaps

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of people in new hampshire
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
do not get to utilize and i thank you
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for for the
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
question and i'll uh
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
i will give you i think it's a more as
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
much a philosophical answer
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
as an economic answer um
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
and roughly half of our population is
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
served by
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
wells private wells and half by public
 
01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
wells private wells and half by public
water

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
um i think of the benefit of public
 
01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
um i think of the benefit of public
water

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh goes beyond the same myself
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
at the tab uh say in the city of concord
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
where we have public water
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
it supports businesses that uh
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know state of course is a big one
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
the hospital uh
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
the schools in the area and my
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is roughly
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
40 000 people almost the population of
 
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.550 align:start position:0%
40 000 people almost the population of
concord

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
migrates in to work in the city
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
so there's a broad economic benefit that
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
comes from public water
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
um i think of the resort communities
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh i know north conway is an example
 
01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:12.310 align:start position:0%
uh i know north conway is an example
that

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
you may have seen testimony from
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many hundreds of
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
thousands of people go up to north
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
conway that
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
you don't even live in the state but
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
they spend
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars uh in the state that
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
then spreads out to
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of people i'm surely including
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
folks that aren't on the public water
 
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.950 align:start position:0%
folks that aren't on the public water
system

01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
and if there wasn't public water up
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
there you couldn't do it
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
um the other corollary i think of is
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
generally and maybe this is
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
is this question of of public and
 
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.709 align:start position:0%
is this question of of public and
government

01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
service um you know my kids
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
are out of public school uh they have
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
been for a while
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
and yet uh we still pay taxes for public
 
01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.470 align:start position:0%
and yet uh we still pay taxes for public
school

01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
um there's roads in the state i'll never
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
drive on
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
but uh my taxes or you know your taxes
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
help support that uh there's things like
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
medicare there's there's
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's military there's you know
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
government services of all the
 
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.350 align:start position:0%
government services of all the
departments

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
and i may not be using that
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
myself but the fact that my neighbor can
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
or a visitor can
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
often has value so that's
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the best i can do with that one sir but
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate your perspective
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you that answer your question
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
represent edwards
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh it it does i don't think it's a
 
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh it it does i don't think it's a
question

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
that has a clear answer i i mean as as i
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
was listening sir i was
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
i was thinking about snow plows
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh every town pays for their own snow
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
plowing because
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
they need their roads clear and it
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
benefits them but benefits everyone but
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
auburn isn't paying for concord's
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
snow plowing so so i i don't know that
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's an answer to this just a
 
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.430 align:start position:0%
there's an answer to this just a
discussion

01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative amberger is
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh sorry ken this is not really a
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
question but
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh bill hounsell was not able to
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
initially get on to zoom for the
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%

list was again
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
becky benvenuti from the new hampshire
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
can we bring her up mike or nixie

welcome good morning again thank you
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee um again for the record becky
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
benvenuti government finance advisor for
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
the nhma
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
and of course i am here today to speak
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
in strong support of hb 412.
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the bill which provides 500 000
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
in both fiscal year 2022 and 2023 for
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
public water supply projects
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
is extremely important bill and as
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
noted in their fiscal note
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
using these monies to pay back the 20 to
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
25 percent of the
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
annual loan amortization amounts set
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
forth in rsa 48
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
486 a could generate a very positive
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
environmental impact
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
from a significant number of water
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
system improvement projects
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
and what that statute does it provides
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
an incentive
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it creates affordability for
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
municipal and community water
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
systems including the planning and
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
construction of systems and
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
partnering with other water systems
 
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.790 align:start position:0%
partnering with other water systems
interconnection

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
to increase capacity mitigate water
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
supply emergencies
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
and provide high quality clean water for
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
their residents
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
while the again it's consolidating and
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
connecting water systems
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
is something that's strongly advised and
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
encouraged by state and federal agencies
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
the difficulty is that forging these
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
types of quality partnerships
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
can be extremely difficult at the local
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
level without the direct assistance from
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
either the state or the local government
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
um i i won't go into you know
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
specifically what rsa 486a
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
states but i just think it's important
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
to you know reiterate recognize that it
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
does state that
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
it shall pay shall be eligible um for
 
01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.070 align:start position:0%
it shall pay shall be eligible um for
these

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
for these um state aid grants but
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's been a moratorium
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
on new public water systems state aid
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
grants since 2008.
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the program did receive some
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
funding and governor and executive
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
council approved drinking water projects
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
that were retroactive back until
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
2007 but since that time the program has
 
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
2007 but since that time the program has
remained

01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
remained
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
unfunded while more than 15 currently
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
eligible drinking water interconnection
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
projects await grant approval
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
and to speak to the earlier question
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
as the state strives for clean drinking
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
water consolidation
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
some of the benefits that do reach all
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire residents whether i'm
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
on a private well as well but whether
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
we're on a private well or public water
 
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
we're on a private well or public water
system

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
is it addresses source water
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
contamination issues it addresses fire
 
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
contamination issues it addresses fire
suppression

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
suppression
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh redundant source distribution to many
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
public water systems
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
and it achieves a lower health risk and
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
cost to the general population
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
from drinking this water the the annual
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
principal and interest payments
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
by the state to help construct these
 
01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:01.910 align:start position:0%
by the state to help construct these
projects

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
is less than the amount of money that
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
will come back into the state general
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
fund which again benefits all of us from
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
the enhancement of economic development
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday there was a large meals and
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
rooms tax bill and i think that's a
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
great example that
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
that boyd gave speaking about north
 
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:19.990 align:start position:0%
that boyd gave speaking about north
conway

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
conway
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the vibrant um
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
the the vibrant tourist industry that's
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
up there the meals and rooms taxes
 
01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
up there the meals and rooms taxes
generated

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
generated
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
from those entities would not be
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
possible without
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
the expansion of these
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
quality and quantity of the water
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
interconnection projects
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
so the funding for this state aid grant
 
01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:42.709 align:start position:0%
so the funding for this state aid grant
program

01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
would allow municipalities to construct
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
now while the interest rates are low
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
and before the costs increase more but
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
it it does help meet both
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
local and state goals and we ask you to
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
please vote to pass

he's hearing us
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%

01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know what i don't know what the
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
problem is i just know that

he wants to testify so
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
well and i think
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
nancy there is a way he can he can go

01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
as a phone number which i don't yet
 
01:19:54.719 --> 01:20:00.390 align:start position:0%
as a phone number which i don't yet
see

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
audio i need to update my computer
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
all right we're hearing you
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
okay i apologize for the delay
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
if i could speak uh to uh hp 398 i would
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
so that i congratulate the committee on
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
what they did last session to
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
to bring us up to current on the
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
projects that would do and deserving of
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
principal interest payments
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
it is now in position to
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
keep us current and the list of projects
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
on the 2022 list are projects that
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
are making payments now and so this is
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
an important
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
thing to recognize as we look at this
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
budget and send it to division one
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
for review and and always say that the
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
same bill is being heard on the senate
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
finance side at the same time so
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
the way we did it last time seemed to
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
work pretty well and i'm hoping that
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
this this bill will uh at least tom
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
bucco and karen's bill will
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
will raise this issue to the level of
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
priority to give it the credence it's
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
deserving of
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
these these federal regulatory drivers
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
that force the
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the state new hampshire department of
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
of course are the ones that oversee the
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
federal clean water act
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
are the are driving the communities to
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
do what needs to be done to keep our
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
waterways clean and also
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
to treat the the water the drinking
 
01:22:15.679 --> 01:22:16.629 align:start position:0%
to treat the the water the drinking
water

01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
that it comes back out in order to
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
protect our aquifers and source of
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's no more project no more
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
partnership and funding is
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
that it's as vital as this state aid
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
it was this particular bill was put in
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
place in 1993
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
to address the surface water treatment
 
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
to address the surface water treatment
rule

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
and it also uh was in
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
combination with with the need of
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
wastewater to clean up
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
the drinking water so before we had
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
cultures of two different
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
different breeds if you will drinking
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
water was one culture wastewater was
 
01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.830 align:start position:0%
water was one culture wastewater was
another

01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
in recent years we've come to understand
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
that they're one they're one in the same
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
we in order to protect the source of our
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
drinking water we have to build these
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
plants to treat our water as we put it
 
01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
plants to treat our water as we put it
back

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
into the ground so so
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
as we talk about the wastewater aspect
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
it also links in with 412 which is the
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
drinking water aspect
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
the wastewater aspect really happens
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
because the communities at the local
 
01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:28.390 align:start position:0%
because the communities at the local
level

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
trust that that partnership is reliable
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the state put this partnership in
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
place in law
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be to be a funding partner and to pay
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
annual principal and interest portions
 
01:23:42.239 --> 01:23:42.790 align:start position:0%
annual principal and interest portions
between

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
20 and 30 percent on projects that are
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh deserving of uh of
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
the affordability index and that that's
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
based on rates
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh 20 is for a normal race but stress
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
rates get 30 percent
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
and some of the bonds are 20 years long
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
some are 30 years long so these
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
projections that you see before you
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
are based on the department of
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
environmental service staff
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
projections which are pretty accurate
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
i think if we can budget for the total
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
view that we're looking at instead of
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
part of the view
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
we would we would come to a more flat
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
line and we've talked about this in past
 
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:25.750 align:start position:0%
line and we've talked about this in past
years

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
a more flatline way of funding these
 
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
a more flatline way of funding these
programs

01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
to give a reassurance and trust and
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
reliable confidence when they pass the
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
bonds at the local level
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
that this partnership is reliable is
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
dependable and that
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
our legislators understand it and and
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
take a position to to support and fight
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
for that uh
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
consistent funding program um
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
i i think that's what i would like to
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
say about the wastewater
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
and then i would uh if you if you don't
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
mind i would shift gears and go into the
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
the bill that's before you now house
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
hospital 412 is
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
is a new new view of what we haven't
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
been doing
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
we have been so concentrated on
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
getting all those projects that were
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
paying bond debts at the local level on
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
the wastewater side
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's a moratorium that went on to the
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
drinking water side
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
in 2008 kind of laid in limbo without
 
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.550 align:start position:0%
in 2008 kind of laid in limbo without
any

01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
again when i when when that was put in
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
it was the bill was put in
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
i wrote the bill in in the early 90s
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
to address the surface water treatment
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
rule which was
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
a federal rule that said that if you had
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
an open source of water you had to
 
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.110 align:start position:0%
an open source of water you had to
either

01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
build a filtration plant or cover your
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
water storage
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
tanks and it was again that for federal
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory drivers was imposing greater
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
consequences of cost on the
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities to comply with the
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
federal drivers
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
so that law when we would put it in
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
place all of a sudden all of the
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
communities that hadn't been taking
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
action came forward and started doing
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
building these
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
these systems and that partnership made
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
it affordable so they could see at the
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
local level
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
a reason uh to do it and not
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
they've always wanted to do it at the
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
local level but
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
as you well know most bonds will not
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
be passed unless the people are very
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
confident when they put their
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
property up as collateral against those
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
bonds that they can make those payments
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
they have that confidence when the state
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
with within a partnership in grants that
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
makes it affordable by the state's
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
state and federal government's own
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
formulas of affordability
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
so it's not a giveaway program it's a
 
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
program that that makes things happen
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't happen
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise and i i believe that's where
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
we are now we've completed the surface
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
water treatment rule
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
but in later years we added the
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
interconnection grant program
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
the interconnection grant program has
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
been in limbo since 2008 and that's why
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to resuscitate this
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
500 000 would start
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh supporting the 16 million worth of
 
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh supporting the 16 million worth of
projects

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that are on the list now and i i've
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
given a list
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
some of those projects on the written
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
comments that i gave you
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
five five five hundred thousand would
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
support some of the des staff that's
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to oversee this but it also
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
would support the
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
four hundred and twelve thousand dollar
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
a year payments on those 16 million
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of local debt
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh to to do this consolidation
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh here here is a tremendous bang for
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
your buck
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
because when you start to interconnect
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
those systems
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
you start to pick up a lot of the little
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
water systems along the way there
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
that are stressed or drinking naturally
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
contaminated water a lot of which
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
the people don't know about i could cite
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
to you for instance attitude mountain
 
01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:17.189 align:start position:0%
to you for instance attitude mountain
between

01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
lower bartlett and bartlett village
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
which has
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
on their peak many many people coming
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
down skiing and stopping in a little
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant and bar
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
area and drinking the water that is has
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
natural contaminants in it
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
without even knowing it and they don't
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
know it because
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it's it's a transient system
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's not regulated by the federal
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
drivers and
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
that gives them deficiency reports but
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
we know it we know it at the local level
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
and the state's aware of it
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
and we need to treat those people that
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
come into our state and drink that water
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
as if they were our own citizens and a
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
project like the connection between
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
lower bartlett and bartlett village
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
starts to handle those
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
types of issues as an example it also
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
would allow for economic growth that
 
01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.350 align:start position:0%
would allow for economic growth that
would

01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
occur as a result of the quality and
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
quantity of water that would be provided
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
up there
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
and it gives redundancy for instance the
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
bartlett village by interconnecting
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
a lower bartlett village to to water
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
system to
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
bartlett village water system we have by
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
the use of this program
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
connected conway village fire district
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
to north conway village prior
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
to north conway water precinct the use
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
of these grants we made it affordable
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
those bonds pass
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that has happened think of the
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
marvelous accomplishment when you
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
connect uh a water systems
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
sub governments they keep their own
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
autonomy their own entities they control
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
their own destinies
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
but they link to each other and
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
consolidate the sources
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
if something should happen to one source
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
a truck skill or a
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
rollover fuel getting into it or
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
something along those
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
the aquifer they can shut down that well
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
and draw water from other sources
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
along the with the length of mount
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
washington valley
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
that is exactly exactly the kind of
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
system that supports
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
the regional opportunities for the kind
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
of people that
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
the quantity of people that come into
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
that valley
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
i would tell you that north conway
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
bartlett jackson that whole valley has a
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
seasonal population of 15
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
000 but overnight on a friday night of
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
good skiing and in the summer when the
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
weather is
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
beautiful and this hiking is what the
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
people and being in the river is what
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
the people desire
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
they they come in to the quantity of
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
about 34 000.
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's the size of the city of
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
rochester so
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at these small systems and
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
you look at these little village
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
districts you've got you have to realize
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
the tremendous economic value it has to
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
for uh for the investment that the state
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
puts into annual principal interest
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
payments to support this amazing amazing
 
01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.070 align:start position:0%
payments to support this amazing amazing
debt

01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
at the local level 10 million dollars
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
flat line budget on on these kinds of
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
programs on on the sag programs
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
accommodates hundreds of millions of
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
dollars of local debt
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
i i i won't go on any anymore because
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
i i know uh becky's covered marvelously
 
01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:27.350 align:start position:0%
i i know uh becky's covered marvelously
and

01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
and and as as boyd smith the the other
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
backgrounds of health and economic
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
activity and growth and
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
um and all of the issues that uh they so
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
are so well verbalized but
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a key battle it's a
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
priority battle for the budget
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
if there's anything that helps help
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of health and human
 
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.189 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of health and human
services

01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's investment in water infrastructure
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
every dollar you put into this sag
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
program will yield much more back into
 
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
than you invest in it it's really really
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer to be doing what we're
 
01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.310 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer to be doing what we're
doing

01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for listening to me
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr householder any of the
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
on house bill 412
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
i have uh four people to testify and
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
i have 17 in support zero opposed
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
in essence of time i won't read all the
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
names again
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
but most of them when i did uh
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
398 a lot of the same people so
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
you've heard uh the talk on both
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
wastewater and drinking water
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
and that will be discussed and hopefully
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
we will be able to fit it into the
 
01:32:56.239 --> 01:32:56.709 align:start position:0%
we will be able to fit it into the
budget

01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge amount
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's no questions for any of the
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
people on that i will close the hearing
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
on house bill 412
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
and we will move on to the 10 30
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
bill which 623
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll recognize this is an education
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill will recognize the prime sponsor
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%

but um but a unifying theme throughout
the

01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
school funding commission's work is
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
based on the data
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
that we that were reviewed and the
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony and comment
 
01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:34.870 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony and comment
received

01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
is that education funding policy should
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
be guided by
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
the fundamental concept that any
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
solutions must focus
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
on all of our students funding policies
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
must be student-centered
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
and designed to create equal opportunity
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
in order to narrow the achievement gaps
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
associated with poverty and other forms
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
of social disadvantage
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
closing those gaps for all students
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of their needs or where they
 
01:34:58.960 --> 01:34:59.590 align:start position:0%
regardless of their needs or where they
live

01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
became the shared vision among
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
commission members
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to fiscal policy the
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
commission found that new hampshire's
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
current system of funding fails to
 
01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.270 align:start position:0%
current system of funding fails to
direct

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
direct
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
aid to more needy communities in a
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
meaningful manner
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
and inequities manifest themselves in
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
more needy districts
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
through lower student outcomes and
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
higher property tax burdens
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think we're probably all familiar with
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
that key findings from the school
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
funding commission
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
center on student outcomes a combination
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
of student performance on statewide
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
assessment tests
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and attendance rate
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
overall new hampshire students perform
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
very well
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
and in fact rank among the best in the
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
country but we also found that in
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
districts with higher incidences
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
of poverty student outcomes are well
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
below state average
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
and these uh school districts spend less
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
on education
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
than do districts serving more affluent
 
01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.270 align:start position:0%
than do districts serving more affluent
communities

01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
the commission looked at 10 years of
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
data from new hampshire schools
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
specifically student and community
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
characteristics student outcomes
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
and how money is spent and developed a
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
formula to estimate the cost for every
 
01:36:07.119 --> 01:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
formula to estimate the cost for every
district

01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
to educate students to a statewide
 
01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.830 align:start position:0%
to educate students to a statewide
outcome

01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
and we developed a funding formula using
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
local taxes
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then the limited state funds that we
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that every student has
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
access to the resources they need
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't break the bank and it doesn't
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
require new taxes
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
so what what i'd like to do um mr chair
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
is um is is talk specifically about uh
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 623
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is directed to stabilize state
 
01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:38.629 align:start position:0%
which is directed to stabilize state
funding

01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
for fiscal years 22 and 23
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
the the coming biennium and fy 22
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
is the is the school uh budgets
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
that school boards and budget committees
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
around the state are all
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh are all working on right now and will
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
be a subject of um
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh annual district annual meetings
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
coming up in the next months
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
so so the uh the reason to uh to
 
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.550 align:start position:0%
so so the uh the reason to uh to
stabilize

01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
stabilize
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
um school fun state funding for these
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
two years is really
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of three things number one
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
and um and it also um restores
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
the need-based funding that was um
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
so important uh in the in the
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee's commission's recommendations
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
that what was included uh for school
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
districts in the fy 21 budget
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh the need based funding is uh is
 
01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.350 align:start position:0%
uh uh the need based funding is uh is
certainly

01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's a key recommendation from the
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
commission the um
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
state grants to schools are calculated
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
in rsa 198
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
40 and 41 and the adequacy grant
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
is calculated based on the prior year
 
01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.709 align:start position:0%
is calculated based on the prior year
enrollment

01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
so for fy 22 the enrollment or the adma
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
which is the average daily
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
daily membership and attendance is based
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
on students counts reported to the new
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of education
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
back on october 1st 2020. so
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so these adma numbers
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
are um are there
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's quite a quite a huge dramatic
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
difference from from what we saw
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
on on october 1st 2020 to what
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
um what we saw on october 1st on 2019.
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
so uh 2019 the adma and this is from the
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
from the department spreadsheets was
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
about 167
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
000 well it was exactly 167 298 students
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
and um and a year later um the the
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
enrollment that we would be basing
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
school funding on for the coming year
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
is uh is is almost is more than seven
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
thousand less
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh 160 191 um
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
that um that disparity
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
is uh is further um uh uh
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
amplified in the free and reduced price
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
lunch count um uh uh students and and uh
 
01:39:04.239 --> 01:39:04.550 align:start position:0%
lunch count um uh uh students and and uh
and

01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
i think we all recognize that uh that
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
free and reduced
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
price lunch is a is a key component of
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
the differentiated aid
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
calculation that specifically helps
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
school districts serving um more
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
more impoverished populations
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
and that count dropped from five
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred eighty six
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
to thirty four thousand um six hundred
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
twenty eight
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
so uh so a huge huge drop there what is
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
it what does it do as far as
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
as far as um adequacy fund or or the
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
state grants to school districts is
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
concerned well
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
it um it reduces base adequacy this is
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
for all districts by more than 12
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
it reduces the free and reduced price
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
lunch differential aid
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
by almost 24 how much would i say 12
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars in base
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced price lunch
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
by nearly 24 million dollars the um
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then the uh the need-based um grants
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
for fiscal disparity
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
which go away in fy 22 amount to another
 
01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:13.430 align:start position:0%
which go away in fy 22 amount to another
12

01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars and the um
 
01:40:16.159 --> 01:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars and the um
the

01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
need-based grant for free and reduced
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
price lunch
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
which also disappears in fy 22 is nearly
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh nearly 50 million dollars actually i
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
had those two numbers back
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
the disparity is 50 million and free and
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch is another 12
 
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.189 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch is another 12
million

01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
um what um what that means for
 
01:40:34.159 --> 01:40:35.270 align:start position:0%
um what um what that means for
manchester

01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
is really eye-opening um uh just in the
 
01:40:38.639 --> 01:40:39.590 align:start position:0%
is really eye-opening um uh just in the
adequacy

01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh component alone um
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
manchester state adequacy grant would
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
fall from 14 and a half million dollars
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
to just under 10 million dollars and the
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
um the need-based um grants for
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
for fiscal disparity and free and
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
would fall by over seven million dollars
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's just to manchester
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
and you know that's the largest school
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
district in the state
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
serving nearly thirteen thousand
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
students and um
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh and and students that that on average
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
are underperforming state um uh state
 
01:41:16.719 --> 01:41:17.669 align:start position:0%
are underperforming state um uh state
outcomes

01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh significantly so um statewide
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's a 90 million dollar um uh
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
loss in funding and uh and i think the
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
the report that
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
that uh that the um that the committee
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
will receive from the lba
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh bears that out on a on a town by town
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
and district by district
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
basis um so so that's the
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's the the number one thing that
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 623 does the
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
the second thing is um is is not as
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
big a dollar amount but it's still an
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
important factor
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and it's actually got to do with
 
01:41:55.199 --> 01:41:55.830 align:start position:0%
and uh and it's actually got to do with
um

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
with full day kindergarten startup
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
grants which
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
which were were certainly uh certainly
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
an important uh
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
consideration back when full-day
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten funding was
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh was was was brought on board several
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and um and uh what we had noticed
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
last year and i had introduced the bill
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1691
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh that um that apparently when
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
when changes were made to the full-day
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
kindergarten program
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
the startup grant element of it was
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
inadvertently dropped
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
and what the startup grant means is that
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
on the first year
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
a um a district offers full day
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
kindergarten that
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
those full um the st
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
all the students in that in that class
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
on october 1st
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
are counted towards their adequacy grant
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
and because you know like we were just
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant um trails by one year
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
so so we didn't want to we didn't want
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
to penalize uh school districts in the
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
first year
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
or disincentivize them from from
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
implementing full day kindergarten
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
so um so unfortunately 1691 which
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
cleared the house education committee
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing and then went to your
 
01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.350 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing and then went to your
committee

01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh back in march ended up dying at the
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
end of uh
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the session that bill was rolled in
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
to the education omnibus bill house bill
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
1558 in section 2
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
which which adopted the language from um
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
from from house bill 1691 but
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
in uh in that flurry of activity at the
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
end of last session
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
the effective date was uh was not
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
amended so
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
in order to uh to capture school
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
districts that
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
that implemented uh full-day
 
01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:45.830 align:start position:0%
that implemented uh full-day
kindergarten

01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh during during fy20 you need to have
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
an effective date that's also in fy 20
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and unfortunately the effective
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
date on that um
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
missed that by uh by 29 days so house
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
bill 623
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
rectifies that effective date problem
 
01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:03.109 align:start position:0%
rectifies that effective date problem
and

01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh what you can see in the um
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the fiscal note for um
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
for 623 is
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
um is this on the last page of the
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the fiscal year 2020 first year
 
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.070 align:start position:0%
the uh the fiscal year 2020 first year
programs

01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
it affects the districts of chester
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
salem and windham
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's a total of eight hundred and forty
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
that that they all fully expected to
 
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.550 align:start position:0%
that that they all fully expected to
receive

01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh and didn't receive
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
due to um due to you know
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
just due to our own legislative uh
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh issues and uh the fiscal mode also
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
goes on to
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
show fy 2021 first year programs
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
but that's already in the law so so
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's nothing
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's nothing new there so with that
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
conclude my my introductory remarks
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%

01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
the as i understand it
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
in 2021 there was
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
additional money provided to the
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
school districts for them to
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
improve some infrastructure work i'm
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't know what that dollar
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
value was
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
but are you excluding that
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
from the um from the bill
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much thank you very
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
much for the uh for the question yeah
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's not uh that's not part of this
 
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.229 align:start position:0%
that's not uh that's not part of this
bill

01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
that's the uh the i think it was called
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the capital infrastructure grants
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
and um uh and they were they were they
 
01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.070 align:start position:0%
and um uh and they were they were they
were

01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
they were specifically designed to i
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
think improve safety and security
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
within uh within public school buildings
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe that program has uh
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
has wrapped up now but no that's got
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any of the numbers in
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
okay but when when i read the bill
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
it says it won't be less than
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
what was provided in the past pri
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the prior year it doesn't say that it
 
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.149 align:start position:0%
in the prior year it doesn't say that it
excludes

01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
excludes
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
the um infrastructure grants
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
and so that was a concern that i had
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
and so what you're telling us is
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
actually to go back well to look at
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
2021 excluding
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure grant is that correct
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh representative
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
bumberger and um
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
and you know the the language in the
 
01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
and you know the the language in the
bill

01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
in in item e it talks about the total
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
education grant
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
so so that is that is something that um
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
the lba has that uh uh uh
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
defined very accurately i believe in
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
their in their fiscal note
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
to be the the combination of the
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant the fiscal disparity um
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
grant the enhanced free and reduced
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
lunch grant the stabilization grant
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
and the excess swept grant um and the
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the swept grant
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
that that is uh that is provide
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much to um through the
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
state to school districts
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath for a
 
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath for a
question

01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um thank you
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative luno uh
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
i think we all realize what our local
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
school districts are going
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
through right now it's a tough time
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
the intent of your bill i believe
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong is to really
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
make school districts whole at this
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
for the losses that they will incur from
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
extreme drops in enrollment
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
and also in terms of the free and
 
01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:54.470 align:start position:0%
and also in terms of the free and
reduced

01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
lunch funds that they would have gotten
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that children are
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
not attending schools am i correct
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
no that's that's that's completely
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
the the the first part when we talk
 
01:49:08.719 --> 01:49:09.270 align:start position:0%
the the the first part when we talk
about

01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
holding them harmless to the the drop of
 
01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
holding them harmless to the the drop of
enrollment

01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's of no fault of school districts i
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
mean that is completely pandemic related
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
um uh enrollment um um
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
decline that is totally uh just
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
with a disconnect of of from the from
 
01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:28.149 align:start position:0%
with a disconnect of of from the from
the

01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
sort of annual 1 ish decline that we've
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
been seeing so
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know this is enormous declines you
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
know 25
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
decline in free and reduced price lunch
 
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:39.270 align:start position:0%
decline in free and reduced price lunch
8

01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
8
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
i think decline in in total enrollment
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
so so uh so that that's not that's not
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
sort of the normal course the other two
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
are um
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
are are not pandemic related but but
 
01:49:52.239 --> 01:49:53.189 align:start position:0%
are are not pandemic related but but
clearly

01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
our our student equity and taxpayer
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
equity related
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
which i think during a pandemic sort of
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
cert certainly have a
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
a bearing given the additional cost that
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
school districts are facing
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the additional stress that um that
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
that all
 
01:50:11.589 --> 01:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
students are um are under so um so
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's why um that's why this
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill includes
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
um those two uh grants as well
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%

this house bill 623 i am in favor
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
of this house bill as a
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of new hampshire and
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
currently a school board representative
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
for my local district
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
we are on the front lines of watching
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
our community be pit against each other
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
as we battle appropriate adequate
 
01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
as we battle appropriate adequate
education

01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
and the balance of our property taxes
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
in the last five years that i've sat on
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
the school board locally
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
i have seen uh fluctuations in
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated revenue from the state
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
jump and reduce our overall property tax
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
by several dollars every year
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
when you say several dollars that
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of money until you start
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
multiplying that by
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
of course uh your your property values
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
and you realize that your revenues and
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
what you might be responsible for
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
offsetting through taxation
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
can change hundreds of thousands of
 
01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.870 align:start position:0%
can change hundreds of thousands of
dollars

01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
last year what happened in our local
 
01:52:30.239 --> 01:52:31.350 align:start position:0%
last year what happened in our local
district

01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
with this reduction in overall revenues
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
anticipated from the state
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
and having to make that up from our
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
was i would say nothing short of a
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
revolt by multiple
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and ultimately a reduction of
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
one point six million dollars
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
to our budget to be very clear
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
out of that one point six million that
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
was reduced
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
over nine hundred thousand dollars of
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
our increased budget was
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
strictly tuition based so
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
what that means is while our contractual
 
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
what that means is while our contractual
obligations

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
to our teachers to the bus company
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
to um you know the state of new
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement for our teachers to
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
the pension
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
while all of that remains the same we
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
are tasked with reducing a significant
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
input and impacting a significant amount
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
that meant that we had to take away
 
01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:30.709 align:start position:0%
that meant that we had to take away
busing

01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
busing
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
to our high schoolers so our parents are
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
made responsible for transporting their
 
01:53:36.159 --> 01:53:37.030 align:start position:0%
made responsible for transporting their
students

01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
to our into our matriculating district
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
which is 25 minutes from us
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
we also reduced staff by 23 staff
 
01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.390 align:start position:0%
we also reduced staff by 23 staff
members

01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
coming into a pandemic you can imagine
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
that has placed
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of burden in addition to this
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic on our parents
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
on our students concerned about
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
transportation to high school
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
and on our local elementary and middle
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
school as that staff
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
grapples with trying to provide
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
excellent remote education and on-site
 
01:54:06.239 --> 01:54:07.189 align:start position:0%
excellent remote education and on-site
education

01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
reduced by 23 staff i think it's really
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
important that the state of new
 
01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:14.229 align:start position:0%
important that the state of new
hampshire

01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
not just continue to put forward a stop
 
01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.629 align:start position:0%
not just continue to put forward a stop
gap

01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
gap
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
in funding but also develop appropriate
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
funding for us moving forward but in the
 
01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.149 align:start position:0%
funding for us moving forward but in the
interim

01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
interim
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
this bill in ensuring that for at least
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
the immediate future
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
our residents our students and our staff
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%

have stability in what they can expect
for

01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%

or is it all remote our school district
 
01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:33.430 align:start position:0%
or is it all remote our school district
is

01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
currently all remote but only due to the

immediate area
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
our plan is to head back into our hybrid
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
if i might follow up please follow up
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that you were doing
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
face-to-face learning and then
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
stopped we were doing face-to-face
 
01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:03.030 align:start position:0%
stopped we were doing face-to-face
learning

01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
learning
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
in a hybrid model with most of our
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
students on campus two days a week
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and then rotating through two days a
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
week up until
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh november so yes we had been doing
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
face to face
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
and we do continue to even through uh
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
the pandemic where we've been
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
shut down to most face to face
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
we of course continue to offer all of
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
the students
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
testify this morning on house bill 623
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is jeff mcclinch
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm the project director of the new
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire school funding fairness
 
01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:25.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire school funding fairness
project

01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
the aim of house bill 623 is clear
 
01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:28.950 align:start position:0%
the aim of house bill 623 is clear
simple

01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
and essential it seeks to put a floor
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
under the education aid that the state
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
provides to cities and towns
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
and ensure that for each of the next two
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
years every community
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
receives at least the same amount of
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
education aid that they receive at
 
01:57:41.599 --> 01:57:42.629 align:start position:0%
education aid that they receive at
present

01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
given the long-standing problems that
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
plague new hampshire's school funding
 
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.070 align:start position:0%
plague new hampshire's school funding
system

01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
as well as the new challenges students
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
families and schools face
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
i cannot urge the committee strongly
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
enough to recommend house bill 623 as
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
moreover as communities across new
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire are already weighing difficult
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
budgetary decisions for the coming year
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
i would similarly urge the committee to
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
act on 623 as quickly as possible
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i just want to underscore a couple
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
of points that are made to date
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh in setting uh education aid at for 22
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
and 23
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
um at no less than what it receives in
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
the current year the bill would achieve
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
two important ends
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
first it would preserve the progress
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the legislature made under the
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
in bolstering state education aid and
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
targeting it to those cities and towns
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
most in need
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
as representative luna explained um the
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
budget agreement added two elements to
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
the funding formula for fiscal 21
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
additional aid which is intended to
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
assist cities and towns
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
with higher concentrations of low-income
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
students and fiscal capacity disparity
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
aid which is designed to help you miss
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities with comparatively low
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
property values
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
as these two forms of aid begin to take
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
steps toward addressing two of the flaws
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
inherent in new hampshire's current
 
01:58:52.719 --> 01:58:53.510 align:start position:0%
inherent in new hampshire's current
approach

01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
to funding in schools they should be
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
extended and maintained until more
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reforms are adopted
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
second the bill would help to protect
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
against the pandemic's possible
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
impact on school finances and uh
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative luna detailed these to
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
some degree
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
um as it stands right now i believe the
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
data from the department of education uh
 
01:59:12.159 --> 01:59:13.030 align:start position:0%
data from the department of education uh
indicate

01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
a roughly four percent decline in adm
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
overall and a nearly 25 decline in free
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
adm um you know and the vast majority of
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
school districts have seen these numbers
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
decline in one form or to one degree or
 
01:59:28.639 --> 01:59:29.510 align:start position:0%
decline in one form or to one degree or
another

01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
now both sets of numbers almost surely
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
rebound as the pandemic wayne's
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
and his school resume in person classes
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
full time
 
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
during the 21 22 academic year but again
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
because of the time lag
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's baked into the formula those
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
temporary lower numbers will be used to
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
decide the amount of eight districts
 
01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.350 align:start position:0%
decide the amount of eight districts
receive

01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the coming academic year even as
 
01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.430 align:start position:0%
uh in the coming academic year even as
attendance

01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
slowly climbs back toward normal levels
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
the bill recognizes that the student
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
counts we're seeing now that those
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
estimates we're seeing now
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
are not likely to reflect the situation
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
schools will face this fall
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
and thus sets fiscal 21 funding amounts
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
as a reasonable floor
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
without action along the lines of house
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
bill 623
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
state education age is expected to fall
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
by some 90 million dollars between the
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
current year and next
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
such a drop would force many cities and
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
towns to turn to significant property
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
tax increases
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
or severe spending cuts as they set
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
their school budgets for the next year
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
the scale of such property tax increases
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
could drive the bills homeowners face up
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
by hundreds of dollars for instance if
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
property tax rates um
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
were the mechanisms cities and towns
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
were to use to address those gaps
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
more than 20 of them would have to
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
resort to rate increases in excess of
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
two dollars per thousand of assessed
 
02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.189 align:start position:0%
two dollars per thousand of assessed
value

02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
value
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
just to give another example in an area
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
like farmington for instance
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
a family with a home worth two hundred
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars could see their
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
property tax bill go up by more than
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
four hundred dollars
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
to close that gap if the town were to
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
turn solely to property tax increases
 
02:00:56.709 --> 02:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
to conclude i once again urge the
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend house bill 623 is
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
out to pass
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
and to do so as expeditiously as
 
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:03.109 align:start position:0%
and to do so as expeditiously as
possible

02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
i and the organization new hampshire
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
school funding fairness project
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
look forward to working with the members
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee to try to address these
 
02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:09.669 align:start position:0%
of the committee to try to address these
issues

02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
you may have this morning
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mcclinch any questions from
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative heath has a question
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr mc lynch for your
 
02:01:25.119 --> 02:01:26.149 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr mc lynch for your
testimony

02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
um i just want to go back to your um
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
request that we fast track this bill
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
um and the need to do that could you
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
just reiterate again
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
um the um essential uh need to
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
um move this bill along please
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes um as uh the sponsor of the bill
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
alluded cities and towns are already in
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
the process of setting their budgets for
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
the coming year
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
so um waiting until uh the state budget
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
as a whole is passed
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
would not be as effective if it were to
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
be acted upon quickly
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
it would help help shape the decisions
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're making now
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i know because of the pandemic
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's some fluidity this year
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
to to that budget setting process um
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh towns are are going to approve their
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
budgets more quickly but there are
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
others that may be waiting until may or
 
02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.030 align:start position:0%
others that may be waiting until may or
so

02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
to do so so acting now would be in
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
everyone's best interest
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative weiler
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
um mr mclynch can you expand
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit on the um issue around the
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
free and reduced
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
did i thought i understood
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
that there was uh federal regulations
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
that had been um actually
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
loosened up during the pandemic around
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
the applications and so that's part of
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
why we're having the free and reduced
 
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.149 align:start position:0%
why we're having the free and reduced
issue

02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct there is a federal
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
initiative again due to the pandemic
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
to try to uh ease the process of
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
providing food assistance to families
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
that does not require them to complete
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that they would normally
 
02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:09.669 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that they would normally
use

02:03:09.669 --> 02:03:09.679 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
and that paperwork in turn is normally
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
used to provide accounts of free and
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
reduced price large students for schools
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
so even though um you know hunger issues
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
may be every bit
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
as biting or even worse in the pandemic
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
the number of free reduced price alleged
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
students has declined precipitously
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
not because they're better off because
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're no longer hungry but because the
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
federal government is using a different
 
02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:33.990 align:start position:0%
federal government is using a different
approach

02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
to providing that assistance that
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
assistance i believe has been extended
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
through the end of the school year
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it's going to continue
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
um beyond
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
the current school year so that come
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
this fall you could see that rebound
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
in uh free reduced price lunch
 
02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:50.390 align:start position:0%
in uh free reduced price lunch
enrollments

02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
enrollments
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
just as the lower aid is beginning to
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
take hold
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
if we don't do something
 
02:03:59.190 --> 02:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you any follow-up
 
02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:02.069 align:start position:0%
thank you any follow-up
[Music]

02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%

school administrators association
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman thank you very
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
much for taking my testimony for the
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
record my name is carl latt i'm the
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
school administrators association
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not going to take up a lot of
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
your time this morning you heard
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
mr mc lynch's testimony and we would
 
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.310 align:start position:0%
mr mc lynch's testimony and we would
echo

02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
echo
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
the sentiments raised by mr mc lynch
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
we do know that school districts are
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
faced with
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
a significant fiscal impact
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
in both in the next fiscal year as well
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
as the one following
 
02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we know that a lot of this had
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
school districts providing a high
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
quality education to their children
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
it is all coveted related and while the
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
enrollments may be going down right now
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
and we know that there has been a
 
02:05:13.599 --> 02:05:14.550 align:start position:0%
and we know that there has been a
traditional

02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
unless we hold districts harmless for
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
or two years uh it's going to be
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine whether that
 
02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:26.470 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine whether that
enrollment

02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh is merely uh that enrollment
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh drop is merely a blip or whether it
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
continue districts need to be able to
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
make plans
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
and be able to budget appropriately and
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
school districts and taxpayers need to
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
have the understanding of what their tax
 
02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:45.589 align:start position:0%
have the understanding of what their tax
bills

02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
are going to look like moving forward
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
i did just want to mention very briefly
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
lunch that representative heath brought
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
up and mr mcclinch
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
answered it was definitely a um
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
a gift from the usda um
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic first began that
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the requirements for free lunch
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
were eliminated and essentially all
 
02:06:17.119 --> 02:06:17.669 align:start position:0%
were eliminated and essentially all
students

02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh qualified for free and reduced lunch
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
the problem with that now is that we
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
have a number of
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
families who have not submitted free and
 
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
families who have not submitted free and
reduced

02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
applications and trying to get those uh
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
at this point is
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh incredibly difficult so it was a
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
double-edged sword
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh very helpful especially during the
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
beginning stages of the pandemic
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
but less so now that we're trying to
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
deal with funding
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
so i would just request
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
that that the committee consider
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
moving this bill very very quickly we
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
have deliberative sessions
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
on annual meetings that are already
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
gearing up and getting ready
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions have already
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
occurred where districts have put
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
forward significant budget cuts
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
to deal with the expected decrease
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
in finance for the upcoming fiscal year
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
and we would strongly urge you to
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
vote this bill through and i'll be glad
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
at this time thank you mr chairman thank
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:31.189 align:start position:0%

02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands up so appreciate
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
barrett christina from the new hampshire
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman weiler thank you
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
of barrett christina executive director
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire school boards
 
02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:00.069 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire school boards
association

02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh just as the preceding speakers have
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
said were in
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
full support of this bill most of the
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
points that nhsba was going to make
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
relative to house bill 623 have already
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
been made by the
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
by the previous speakers but if i could
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
just reiterate again that
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
um passing this bill is going to be a
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
significant relief to local property
 
02:08:19.679 --> 02:08:21.270 align:start position:0%
significant relief to local property
taxpayers

02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
we know that our enrollment numbers are
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
very skewed this year
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic i'm sure as
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee knows
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
that school funding in new hampshire is
 
02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:31.750 align:start position:0%
that school funding in new hampshire is
based

02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
based
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
um primarily on on our enrollment
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
numbers there's a lag
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
in getting those for for obvious
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
budgetary reasons
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
um you know we're educating kids this
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
year perhaps with fewer kids in the
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
building or fewer kids enrolled
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
within our school districts based on
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
last year's uh
 
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers and we certainly know
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
that when enrollment numbers are
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
submitted by local school districts to
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
um in the fall of 2021 they're going to
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
be artificially lower
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
um so then funding in subsequent years
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
through state funding in subsequent
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
years is going to
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
um reflect those artificial numbers i
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
would like to make one other aspect
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced uh free and reduced
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh lunch numbers
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
um representative heath you certainly
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
know this and representative petry you
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
certainly know this um
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
with um you know your background in in
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
working for school districts and mr
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
petrie your work on the
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
the farmington school board for a number
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
of years our free and reduced lunch
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
numbers are
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
lower than what they actually are in
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
normal circumstances
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
many parents don't want to fill out that
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
paperwork either
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
because of the stigma or because of uh
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're proud they're too
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
too too proudful to want to accept that
 
02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:48.950 align:start position:0%
too too proudful to want to accept that
help

02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
so our free and reduced lumber numbers
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we report to the state are actually
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
lower than the numbers that were act of
 
02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
of the food that were actually
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the kids that were actually serving
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
um so because of the the waivers um
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
with the the usda and and relaxation of
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
some of the regulations of the um
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
from the federal government while it's
 
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
helpful because it's still putting food
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
in kids mobs it's
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's not helpful from a state funding um
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
perspective relative to the system that
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
we have in new hampshire
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
um you know under the the differentiated
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
aid for the number of kids on free and
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
so um i don't have anything new to add
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
other than i certainly want to thank ms
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
picard from the winchester
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
school board for highlighting the
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
challenges that are going to be going on
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
i'm in winchester with their current
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
budget crisis but um more than anything
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
nhsb again would just like to reiterate
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be a very very
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
helpful bill for local property
 
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.189 align:start position:0%
helpful bill for local property
taxpayers

02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
especially school districts are moving
 
02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
through their budget season right now
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
um as it's been previously mentioned uh
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
nothing else to add with that i'm happy
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%

entertaining me um i'm going to
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
reinforce what some of the other
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
speakers have said i of course the mayor
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
of nashua and i
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking on behalf of our school
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
district which has 11 000 students
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
i can focus on our numbers not because
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're different or more important than
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
someone else's but just because i can
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
give you because i know them but we we
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
would suffer a multi-million dollar loss
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
in school aid
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
causing either a cut in educational
 
02:12:16.719 --> 02:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
causing either a cut in educational
services

02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
or you know teachers probably or
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
a major increase in property taxes in
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
our case the
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
increase is approaches five million
 
02:12:26.639 --> 02:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
increase is approaches five million
dollars

02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
and the such a cut comes right at the
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
long time
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
we are remote right now but we are we
 
02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.109 align:start position:0%
we are remote right now but we are we
are

02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
there the school district is scheduled
 
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
to go back to
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
um reinstituting hybrid learning
 
02:12:41.599 --> 02:12:42.390 align:start position:0%
um reinstituting hybrid learning
starting

02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
starting
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
next week and comes at the wrong time
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
because we know
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
across the state we're suffering serious
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
learning loss among kids who've been
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
trying to learn remotely
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe haven't been successful in
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
or who are not even able to connect
 
02:13:00.239 --> 02:13:01.270 align:start position:0%
or who are not even able to connect
remotely

02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
that's true in some cases and we
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
we need to help these help these kids
 
02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
and get them back to their grade levels
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
if at all possible
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
but the reductions in school aid as
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
you've already heard are caused
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
principally by the lower
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
population numbers the lower census
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
numbers and the lower free and reduced
 
02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
numbers and the lower free and reduced
lunch

02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
numbers these are artificially low right
 
02:13:26.639 --> 02:13:27.510 align:start position:0%
numbers these are artificially low right
now

02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to free and reduced lunch
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
usda the federal government basically
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
made lunches free for anybody any kid
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
which is good great i mean now
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
maybe kids who are on the margins or
 
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
maybe kids who are on the margins or
need

02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
need help otherwise maybe don't qualify
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
get get the free meals but
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
the incentive for free and reduced lunch
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
qualifying families uh there's no
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
incentive anymore to fill out the
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
paperwork because they can get
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch without doing
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
in our case the school district has got
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
maybe two-thirds of the kids to sign up
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
or families to sign up but uh not
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
all of them and so the very precipitous
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
decline is not based on less kids but
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
this uh inability to get paperwork done
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
we may have more free and reduced kids
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
than we had before because
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
some of the service lower income workers
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
laid off as part of the pandemic number
 
02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:32.149 align:start position:0%
laid off as part of the pandemic number
two

02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair the are the
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
there's the reduction in census total
 
02:14:38.719 --> 02:14:39.589 align:start position:0%
there's the reduction in census total
census

02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
census
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
now in our case the school district
 
02:14:43.589 --> 02:14:43.599 align:start position:0%
reports that
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the loss and census
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
is among the kindergarten and
 
02:14:49.199 --> 02:14:50.870 align:start position:0%
is among the kindergarten and
pre-kindergarten

02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
groups of parents and they believe
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
that those kids are going to come back
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
as soon as school is open but for a
 
02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
as soon as school is open but for a
kindergartner

02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
kindergartner
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know to try to learn remotely
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
just or pre-kindergarten is you know
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
just not
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
going to work so a lot of or not work
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
very well
 
02:15:11.589 --> 02:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
so a lot of parents just haven't signed
 
02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
up so
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the end the vast majority of the kids
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
in our case the loss is about 200
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me about 800 would will come back
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the school district
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons i hope mr chair
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the committee will consider
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
recommending the bill for to pass
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
because school districts across the
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
state are facing the same
 
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
problem you've heard about it from small
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
towns now from a larger city
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
we're all facing the same problem and we
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
want to maintain educational quality
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mayor any questions from the
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none i appreciate you coming and
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%

all the the wonderful testimony that has
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
been shared already
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
i too am in support of this bill
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to give you a little bit of
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
perspective from kearsarge's point of
 
02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:01.429 align:start position:0%
perspective from kearsarge's point of
view

02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
view
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
if i could hirsarge is a is a school
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
district that's made up of seven towns
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
we have an enrollment of about eighteen
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty students
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
who are in our school district and i
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let you know that um
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
just some some information about how our
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
year is played out
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
um for us someone uh i believe it was
 
02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
um for us someone uh i believe it was
representative

02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
umberger had asked the question had we
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
been in school or school has your school
 
02:17:27.519 --> 02:17:27.910 align:start position:0%
been in school or school has your school
been

02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
in session throughout the year in person
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
and the answer for us has been yes
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've maintained a schedule since the
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
the start of the school year in which
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
we've created
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
um basically a synchronized learning
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
model in which we have three one-hour
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
blocks of instruction
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
that are offered to our parents
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the day
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
for them to have remote at home learning
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
and that is synchronized with our
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
in-person learning services and so
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
we we knew from the get-go in august
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we were going to have some families
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
that were going to take us up on that
 
02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
that offer um to give you some
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of how our enrollment
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
shifted a little bit
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
in october of 2019 we had 126
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
home-schooled students
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
at october of 2020 that number
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
shifted and was up to an additional 90
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
students who had enrolled in home school
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
based on their inability for the most
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
part to
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
work within the unpredictability
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
of potentially having to shut down the
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
school district for periods of up to 14
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
days to deal with
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
quarantining needs in their classrooms
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
we've been very fortunate
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
that the whole district has only shut
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
down twice i do believe for extended
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
periods around vacation schedules
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
for up to 14 days but we have had a
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
number of parents impacted by the fact
 
02:18:46.479 --> 02:18:47.270 align:start position:0%
number of parents impacted by the fact
that

02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
we've had to quarantine classrooms and
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
that's with six foot distancing
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
teachers wearing the best ppe that we
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
could afford to purchase can 95 masks
 
02:18:55.599 --> 02:18:56.469 align:start position:0%
could afford to purchase can 95 masks
religiously

02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
religiously
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
we've done our jobs we have had zero
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
transmission of student to staff in
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
relative to covent but all of those
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
impacts aside
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
we've watched those homeschooling
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
numbers shift in october from 90
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
up to 106 homeschooling students because
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
of the unpredictability
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the situation that they're having to
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
contend with they opted for
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
um knowing exactly what things would be
 
02:19:18.559 --> 02:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
um knowing exactly what things would be
over

02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
over the conditions that we were trying
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
that said when we talked to all of those
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
homeschooling students we know that
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
by far the 106 additional homeschoolers
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
that we see now
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
and compared to the 90 that we had in
 
02:19:33.439 --> 02:19:35.190 align:start position:0%
and compared to the 90 that we had in
october

02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
october
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
we know that in talking with them
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to return back to our
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
school full they've told us flat out
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
it's a question that we ask them when
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
they inform us they are telling us that
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
they want to come back but they want the
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
security of covid and the vaccinations
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be in play before they do so
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're one to take a look at the impact
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
of those financials
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
just on that pool alone as we start to
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
look at adequacy aid
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
alone all things being equal moving into
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
next year
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking at about a three hundred
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar impact on that
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
population of students
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
alone on the adequacy monies that are
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
assigned to them so
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
i just wanted you to have that number
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
and had three hundred thousand dollars
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
based on that shift of 106 students to
 
02:20:15.359 --> 02:20:15.990 align:start position:0%
based on that shift of 106 students to
homeschooling

02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
alone if you compound that a little bit
 
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
you realize that about five out of our
 
02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:20.950 align:start position:0%
you realize that about five out of our
seven

02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
towns that make up our school district
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
receive those adequacy funds in order to
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
offset the property taxes and such so
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think there's a substantial community
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
impact that's related to that
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
that represents by the way about nine
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
percent of our
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
overall 2.9 million dollars
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's assigned to adequacy funds to
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
impact our student learning
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
i think the only thing i would also add
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
to this is that sometimes we look at
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
these things in isolation but
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
i would hope that you would also
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
consider that right now there's a very
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
strong push that's going on
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
in legislation right now for house bill
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
20 which
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
will substantially impact again monies
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
that are going to be coming into the
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy a polls not only at the local
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
level but at the state level
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know as you start to look at these
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
numbers of home schoolers we're all 226
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
of our homeschooling students um to take
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
the 5 000
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
that is offered to them through that
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity that's being presented in hb
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a loss of oh somewhere
 
02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the order of 1.13 million dollars
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
from kearsarge alone which is not a
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
large school district
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
to the adequacy pool that local number
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
as you start to play around with a
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
little bit is is
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
substantial for us let's just leave it
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
at that so you're not just talking about
 
02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
at that so you're not just talking about
necessarily

02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
stabilizing our budget moving forward
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
you're also stabilizing our budget in
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
the potential face of a massive
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
loss of adequacy funds to the state
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
coffers and
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
substantial increases to the local
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
property tax so
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
if i can answer any questions i'd be
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
happy to do so
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you assistant returning any
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none appreciate your testimony
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
and some detail thank you
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
you make sure that weiler i think
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative umberger and
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative heath have their hands
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
just thank you all right who was first
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
we'll go to representative heath this
 
02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:11.429 align:start position:0%
we'll go to representative heath this
time

02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and and thank you
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
mickey for noticing me
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask a question in
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
regard with regard to the need to move
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
this through if possible legislatively
 
02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
in a rapid fashion um could you
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry is the question of me uh
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative heath i apologize
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes it is um just um in terms of your
 
02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:46.550 align:start position:0%
yes it is um just um in terms of your
budget

02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that these funds would be
 
02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:51.110 align:start position:0%
knowing that these funds would be
available

02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
in what timeline would be the best for
 
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:57.910 align:start position:0%
in what timeline would be the best for
you

02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
obviously as expeditiously as possible
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
um you know as we face all these
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
these these concerns that are coming up
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
with covid right now we've expended
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
just about every single dollar that's
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
come to us from the federal government
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
creating safe conditions within the
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
schools so every dollar lost
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
is representative of the existing budget
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
that we had already proposed
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
so it's not like we can turn around and
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
say that we're going to share these
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
investor dollars and other dollars you
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
know to offset um
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
offset costs that are associated with
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
students moving in and out
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's also important to realize
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
that delay that you're looking at right
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
there you know is a year out
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
and so if those students are coming back
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're kind of seeing a two
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
a twofold hit for us and and i've tried
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
to explain this to people before and
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
they don't really understand this that
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
that when students come back and forth
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
from homeschooling environments the
 
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies that are related with
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
their educational experience create
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
substantial difficulties for school
 
02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:51.349 align:start position:0%
substantial difficulties for school
districts

02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
who are trying to align their
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
educational experiences
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
with state curriculum state mandated
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
curricular around competency development
 
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:00.870 align:start position:0%
curricular around competency development
etc

02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
etc
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
so what happens is you get a twofold
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
increase you get them back so you have
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
to actually service their needs without
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
those adequacy funds in place for them
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
but you also have additional associated
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
costs because we have to recover those
 
02:24:12.399 --> 02:24:13.030 align:start position:0%
costs because we have to recover those
students

02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
and bring them back up to the standards
 
02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
of competency that the state requires
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
so and believe me when i tell you this
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
the majority of the experiences i've
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
worked as a school principal
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
for 15 years prior to my being an
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent for the last
 
02:24:25.359 --> 02:24:26.309 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent for the last
four

02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
in every circumstance that i've ever
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
been in in four districts from the state
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
um some in the southern tier some up
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
here uh in here in southwestern's
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
every single time that i've encountered
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
this homeschooling equation it's always
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
there is a substantial portion of that
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
return that costs us
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
huge amounts of resource times to
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
recover those students because they just
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't get
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
the consistent instructional experience
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
that we would expect of them under the
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
state standards
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank thank you thank you
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.270 --> 02:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah mike thank you very much for uh for
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
my question is uh are the uh
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
school districts required to
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
provide the uh number of homeschoolers
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
to the uh the state that
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
i guess i should say the new
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers to the
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
state so uh in answer to that um
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative hamburger i i don't
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
believe that they're required to
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
represent the the new students they're
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
required to represent the total students
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
through the adma
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
numbers that are uh requested of us or
 
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
demanded of us i should say
 
02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh in october october 1st um and so that
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
sets the values
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the that's the nature
 
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
of this game is that it's
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's a year out in which you you realize
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
and so this is going to impact us but
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be well over a year down
 
02:25:57.429 --> 02:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
the road
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
in that respect if i might follow up
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
follow up so if we
 
02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
took the homeschool figure from
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
2020 and
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh subtracted that out from the total
 
02:26:20.190 --> 02:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers that we have in
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
2021 that would give us some sort of
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
idea as to the
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
number of students that might in fact
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
come back
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
to the school when you meet
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
it it's a difficult prospect because i
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
think every district faces different
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
numbers in different ways and i'll give
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
you another example that's been talked
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
about regionally
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
so we've seen a a number of students
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
since october who've moved in
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
to our school district to take advantage
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
of fall and
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
summer housing uh on in lake properties
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we had uh i looked at my
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
numbers earlier today about 26 students
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
move into the district after october
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
first and we know for a fact that
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
they're living in communities
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
that were summer homes because what
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
happens is
 
02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
under covet is is that communities in
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
manchester who have you know residents
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
there who have summer homes
 
02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
are moving here because of the stability
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
of our educational system
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the low numbers relative to covid in
 
02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
comparison with their homes
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
um where they normally reside and many
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
of those are now indicating to us that
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
they want to stay great we're doing a
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
hell of a job excuse my
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
conversation but but you know it does
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
have a real impact on us because all of
 
02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:29.990 align:start position:0%
have a real impact on us because all of
those

02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
numbers are after the edm numbers have
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
been already figured out
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know the exact way to express
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
that to
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative von berger as to how to
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
give you the most stable numbers
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you this if you do look
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
at those comparisons you are going to
 
02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
at those comparisons you are going to
see

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
students who are returning to our fold
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
who are either going to be students who
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
are going to be move-ins to our
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
community because of our stability
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
or returning home school students and
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
frankly we need those funds
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any further
 
02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:03.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any further
questions

02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%

attendance list that

weren't here at the first call
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%

appreciate you all attending
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
as i said i'll plan to do the exec a
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
week from
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh today at ten o'clock uh we'll do a
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
zoom session again
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh since it'll be a fairly short meeting
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
it isn't worth
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
making a trek if we're gonna have a
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
quick meeting
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
um so we'll have to do that because i
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
i failed to put executive session may
 
02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:25.030 align:start position:0%
i failed to put executive session may
follow

02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll deal with that next week and
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
it'll be a warm-up for hearing the uh
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
peace and the governor's and i know that
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
some of you

02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
they don't come to the whole committee
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%

02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
you for pointing that out i didn't
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know i didn't i didn't think you
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to take the time for me to read
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
237 names so representative weiler i
 
02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
have my hand up i don't think you can
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
see it
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
ah sorry about that no that's all right
 
02:32:50.399 --> 02:32:50.790 align:start position:0%
ah sorry about that no that's all right
uh

02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
i you know from my perspective i i would
 
02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
i you know from my perspective i i would
be

02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
hoping that there'd be a more systemic
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
way of handling the sign-in sheets
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
rather than uh the workaround of having
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
the committee chairs email each
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill's lists out it it seems like
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative walner's brought a a good
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
point and it'd be
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
nice if there was um just a smooth
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
systematic way to have those available
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the public and the committee that
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
would be my request
 
02:33:23.429 --> 02:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
well normally the blue sheet isn't isn't
 
02:33:25.510 --> 02:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
made public if it's very extensive
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's page after page of it
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
um you know sometimes they don't even
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
count them up with the computer counting
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
them up for me
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
so uh but i will i will send all those
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
those forms out that i got that you can
 
02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:40.309 align:start position:0%
those forms out that i got that you can
see

02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh the people that signed up and and how
 
02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:43.670 align:start position:0%
uh the people that signed up and and how
much

02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
how many uh gave how many minutes they
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
were going to speak and so on
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
so yes that's a public thing there's no
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
reason you should all have it
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
should no reason you shouldn't all have
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
it so
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
i will do that and as i said i will
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
talk to janet and put in the uh a
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
