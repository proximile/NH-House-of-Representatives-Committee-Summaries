00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
Podiatry uh so there are two proposals
 
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
from the board of P Podiatry today the
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
first is 2022
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
233 the only comment that we had on this
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
particular uh rule is that the rules are
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
expired um number of them have been
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
expir or actually excuse me all of them
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
have been expired since April of
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
2019 and they include sections such as
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
application and supporting documents
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
timeliness of
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
credentials um type of examination and
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
also fees um so there is a question of
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
whether the board hasn't been enforcing
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
any of these sections in violation of R
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
541 a22 while they've been expired um
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
specifically if they were collecting
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
fees during this
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
time and additionally the new PLC rules
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
that were adopted back in July 2023 do
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
have the fees for this board so it would
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
really be a question of whether or not
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
fees were collected between April of
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
2019 and July of
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
2023 there's also um two notes to the
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
committee one about uh the feed On The
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
Board website uh once again when we were
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
looking at the fee compared to the PLC
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
rule there was a bit of a discrepancy
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
however upon further investigation it's
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
due to that mandatory professional
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
health program fee of
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
$28 uh the other informational note is
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
um once again on the PLC fee rules um
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
and finally on page two there is a edit
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
unclear comment it was made unclear just
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
because it was new and was not
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
um on the final proposal because this
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
was a conditional approval and um there
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
was some additional language that was
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
inserted in there that uh just made it
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
unclear as written so just wanted to
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
bring that to the committee's
 
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.389 align:start position:0%
bring that to the committee's
attention

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
Okay good morning Tina Kelly with the
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
office of professional life insurance
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
certification um with regards to both
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
the 300s and the 500s I went back and
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
looked at the board's previous
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions and there has been
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
no disciplinary action taken for any of
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
the expired
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
rules um as far as the fees go I'm going
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
to have to look into that I do not know
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
if oplc collected fees during that time
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
so I can let you know whether or not
 
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
they did
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
that um I think we addressed the
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
difference in the fees and that was due
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
to the fact that um oplc on the website
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
combines the um fee for the application
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
fee and the um professional health
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
program fee all into one so that people
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
confused and I'm not sure where where
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
was the unclear comment that I need to
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
address um it's in the it's the very
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
last section um of the 300s or the the
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
this is the 300's proposal um so it's
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
33 we we will delete that that is um we
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
should have deleted that so that can
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
come out I have no problem with
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
that are there any other issues I
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
addressed I believe that was it for this
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
proposal representa thank you so in
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
light of House Bill 409 where oplc now
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
is is responsible for licensing and Nic
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
ing renewals does do these rules reflect
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
that because in some cases I think they
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
refer to the board where they should be
 
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
oplc so we've tried to address that but
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
these were back before that all so I'm
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
trying to catch those things as they go
 
00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
trying to catch those things as they go
forward

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
um so I can't guarantee you that I
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
haven't caught every single instance but
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
we are trying to catch them all and if
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
we don't when they come back again we'll
 
00:12:59.069 --> 00:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
we'll finish cleaning them off think 10
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
wait and just for the record uh this
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
particular proposal was filed back in
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
2022 and that's why it's the bill was
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
time so how does this and so how does
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
how do we address that the fact that we
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
have legislation now that conflicts that
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts with rules and we don't really
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
we don't want that and um there's also
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
the um discipline AR components of fines
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
which are also part of oplc now so I'm
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
trying to how do we is this something
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
can we is there something that we can
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
fix between now and next month so that
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
we can give a conditional approval
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
knowing that with the understanding that
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
these things will be
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
addressed um so this could certainly be
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
postponed to give the board an
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look and see if there's
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
anything that needs to be changed and
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
then they could submit a revised amended
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
conditional approval to address that if
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
the board is willing to do
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
that we need to do that we
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
can't I mean we change the law and we
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
can't adopt a rule that's going to be
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
valid for 10
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
years that's based on the previous law
 
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
so I hate to make you do it but it needs
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
to be gone over and updated and also we
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
would want a report on what happened
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
with the fees for the two plus years
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
this was not enforced
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
I I I'll accept your uh your word that
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
there were no disciplinary actions but
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
the I'm I'm more concerned about the
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and Madam chair if we're
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
going to postpone this this will need a
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
waiver second those in favor of asking
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
for a waiver I opposed all right thank
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
you we we will request a waiver and
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
request some a lot of cleanup work on
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
part of oplc so mam J the motion was to
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
postpone till next month and allow the
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
agency time wave any any time
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
constraints and allow the agency to
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
adjust correct right thank
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
you uh so this next one is also the
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
board of P Podiatry it's 2023 118 sorry
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
I only did
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
one um this uh particular proposal only
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
includes one uh section and that has to
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
do on the code of ethics um so the only
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
comment I had on this was that this rule
 
00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:34.839 align:start position:0%
has also been expired and this one was
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
expired since December 15
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
2022 Miss Kelly already reported that
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
there were no disciplinary actions in
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
the period of
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
expiration but uh wonder how we managed
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
to let this sort of important rule
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
expire without anybody worrying about it
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
so to explain that back back um a few
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
months ago we had reported to the
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee that we were working on
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
cleaning up all of the um expired rules
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
so now last month this month maybe even
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
next month you're going to see them
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
getting to the point where they're
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
coming through and getting to that final
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay part of
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
approve any
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.509 align:start position:0%
approve any

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
opposed all right so postpone here and
 
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.430 align:start position:0%

that

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
on excuse me uh Landscape Architects
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval that was
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
filed um however was filed after the
 
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
deadline so the committee is going to
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
have to vote on whether or not to accept
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%

was any
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing any those in favor
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%

care of all the substantive comments so
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
the only um two remaining comments on
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
this proposal are two notes to jail car

about um the board statute um that
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
authorizes the board to set fees is
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
still technically in effect but as we're

comments uh on this particular
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
proposal um the only is the agency may
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
need to pursue a legislative carveout
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
exemption for this program from the
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
requirements of our safe
 
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.870 align:start position:0%
requirements of our safe
541a

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
um um could you explain that for someone
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I'm reading her notes um
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
as attorney Reeves is not here this
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
morning unfortunately she's not feeling
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
well um I I can speak to her if you
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
would like if you would mind thank you
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
um so actually first off uh attorney
 
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
reev did submit some additional comments
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
that I actually spoke with the
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
administrator of the program about we
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
think we can actually make all of them
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
however uh to attorney reichard's Point
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
regarding attorney Reeves notes um this
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
program is the radiological health
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
section for Department of Health and
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
Human Services and they are kind of
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
their hands are tied for lack of a
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
better phrase with regard to certain
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
passages the way the rule is written
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
because it has to be adopted completely
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
as is with respect to abiding by and
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
being um in compliance with the nuclear
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.870 align:start position:0%
being um in compliance with the nuclear
regulatory

00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee or commission's uh rulings so
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
certain passages have to be adopted
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
completely as is um so that is sort of I
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
think what they're speaking about with
 
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
regard to potentially having a carve out
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
legislatively where this might be exempt
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
or something because it has to be
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
regul all right so we've got another
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
program wrapped up in federal red tape
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we can't
 
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.029 align:start position:0%
that we can't
properly

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
control uh would you I think what we
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
should do is ask the program
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
to get some legislation going on that so
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
we can debate whether it should be done
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
you okay nothing further nothing else
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay move to approve and is so long as
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
the department will seek legislative uh
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
assistance from one of the the the board
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
members yes we'll we'll discuss it and
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
see what um is most appropriate with

Lyn
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
opposed all
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
right and Board of
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
Nursing also needs to be postponed yes
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
the board has asked that this be
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
postponed to November and the committee
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
does not need waiver for this one move
 
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.669 align:start position:0%
does not need waiver for this one move
to

00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:32.549 align:start position:0%
to

postpone
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
second any
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
discussion those in post
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
post okay well postponed all right
 
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.630 align:start position:0%
post okay well postponed all right
physical

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
therapist all right so this is another
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
one where there was an amended
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
conditional approval filed um after the
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
conditional approval deadline and I just
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
want to make clear that the conditional
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
approve approval was filed before the
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
deadline but this is the amended
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and we are now
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
asking the committee vote to accept
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
those if they're filed after the
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval deadline move to
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
accept second any discussion those in
 
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.350 align:start position:0%
accept second any discussion those in
favor

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
sosed all right thank thank you for
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
getting it in
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
you uh so this proposal has to do with
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
continued status it's a very long
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
proposal as it includes pretty much the
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
entire 400 chapters
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
a number of the sections are expired um
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
there was 11 sections in total um that
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
have been expired that deal with things
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
such as license subject to reinstatement
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance of continuance and
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
competency uh direct supervision of
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
physical therapists or physical
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
therapist assistant student um so all of
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
those have been expired some since 20
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
December 2021 and others since October
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.909 align:start position:0%
December 2021 and others since October
2022

00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
there's also that informational note
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
about the PLC rules um on pages
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
315 16 of the amended conditional
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
approval with the final note found after
 
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.470 align:start position:0%
approval with the final note found after
the

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
appendix the next comment is on page 11
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
of the amended conditional approval it's
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
an unclear Authority legislative intent
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
comment because the board is imposing an
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
administrative fine if the line does not
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
submit documentation of continuing
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
education within the deadline set by the
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
board when they're being
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
audited the board has set a $50 fee if
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
they are 30 days past their deadline and
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
a $100 fee if they are more than 30 days
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
but less than 60 days past their
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
deadline in the appendix the board cites
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
this Authority as RSA
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
31012 1e which does Grant the board the
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
authority to assess administrative fines
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
for professional misconduct
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
however there is a question of whether
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
or not this particular conduct would
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
fall within the legislative meaning of
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct um there was
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
nothing found within the other statutes
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
that Define what professional misconduct
 
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.269 align:start position:0%
that Define what professional misconduct
would

00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
be so there was a little bit of a
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not the board
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
actually had the authority to set these
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
fines uh the board does say that they
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
have the authority because they are able
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
to establish rules establishing
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
administrative fines and the allocation
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
of disciplinary sanctions um of
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
misconduct by lenses and certified
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and they also argue that
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
within this particular proposal
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
specifically um phy
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
45.0 K they Define misconduct as a
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
violation of any provision of R 329 328
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
F RSA 328a and any rule adopted by the
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
board or any state or federal law
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
however ever defining misconduct within
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
the rules still does not address the
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not it's statutorily
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
allowed so I just wanted the committee
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
to be aware if they had any questions on
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
that I have a question what's the
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
penalty if they never submit this
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
information Tina Kelly office of
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
professional liur and
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
certification um the penalty would be
 
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.669 align:start position:0%
certification um the penalty would be
under

00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
c c which is if they do not sub they go
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
straight to a
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
hearing and or if the they report that
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of continued education they
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
received is less than required the same
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
thing the same thing yes and the board's
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
the board's um the way the board looked
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
at doing it this way was that this gives
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
the um leny the opportunity to decide I
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
want to pay the fine without having to
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
go through the um time and I'm sure
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
expense from missing work of having a
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
hearing as opposed to and if they
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
say I didn't get a notice and I don't
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
think this is fair or they say I was
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
sick then they can request a hearing and
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
they you know that would go before the
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
board so it gives the leny more
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility as to whether or not they
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
want to go before the board and it
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
limits the number of hearings the board
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
would have to have if every single
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
so that implies that that a substantial
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
number of physical therapists either
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't get their uh uh continuing
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
education or don't respond
 
00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:45.470 align:start position:0%
education or don't respond
promptly

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
promptly
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
it and I can speak I can only speak from
 
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
lot 10 to 15 during a licensing period
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
but enough
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
create a lot of um a lot of work to
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
down yes representing and then Senator
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
so um oplc now is having a has is
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
implementing a new online system
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
correct that is my understanding yes so
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
all of these issues
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
will be addressed because the licensing
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
renewals and Licensing is going to come
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
under that system eventually correct
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
they will go through that system to
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
submit continuing education yes okay so
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's my so I think that's an important
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
fact for everyone to know and then
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
number two I'm going to go back to these
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
rules that need to be cleaned up a
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
little bit because on page eight it
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
the board receiving the documents for
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
licensed renewals when in fact it's oplc
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and throughout that whole page it says
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
board rather than
 
00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:12.350 align:start position:0%
board rather than
oplc

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we have to adopt
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
these today but I'd like to put this
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
under the same umbrella as the board of
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
Podiatry and U postpone it until next
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
month to give you a chance to look into
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
this online system and um also um the
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
rules do we need to vote on that it
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't um it's within our deadline uh
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
correct a waiver would not be needed if
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
this is going to be
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
postponed okay so you're you you're
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
moving making a mo I'm moving a motion
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
to postpone with the with the hopes that
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
all this will be cleaned up by next
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
month and we can approve it then second
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor I iOS
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
osed yes please Senator um excuse me I
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
should have pulled on you that's okay um
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
I just want to I'm trying to understand
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
this SP to document the process there so
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
you have a fine if they don't file
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
within 30 days so is that the first fine
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
notice that goes out to them and then
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
you have another fine that if they don't
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
file within 30 to one to 60 there's a
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
second fine notice that goes out and
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
then if they don't do any of that then
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're automatically scheduled for a
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
hearing to um as to why they didn't
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
submit documentation is that the process
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
that would be the process but it's not
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
compounded fine so the fine would be $50
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
for the for and then $100 not $150 after
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
the just to clear up
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
that okay sen uh I also want to ask the
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
department to seek the legislative uh
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
solution to the comment on page 11 to
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that the Authority for the is
 
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:56.230 align:start position:0%
make sure that the Authority for the is
H

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.870 align:start position:0%
 
clear

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion okay we'
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
already voted to postpone it
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
month all
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
right that's the last of these all right
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
management Madam chair I'm going to pick
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
this up Kim um as you're aware this was
 
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.110 align:start position:0%
this up Kim um as you're aware this was
postponed

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
postponed
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh after lengthy discussion about this
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting uh there was
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
considerable concern about the uh um
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
expired rules for hazardous waste fines
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
um ultimately committee um had a concern
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the department
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
indicated that the
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
proposed not the proposed fines but the
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh specified fines in the rules were
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
subject change by hearing officer um in
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
response to that the department has gone
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
in and for every fine they have changed
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
it to proposed so it's a proposed fine
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that they have given
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
us a draft initial proposal in which
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
they amend another rule to specify the
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
criteria by which uh they would
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
determine whether the fine needed to be
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
adjusted from the proposed
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.190 align:start position:0%
adjusted from the proposed
amount

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay Pam Monroe for the Department of
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services attorney moral
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
has correctly represented uh what we've
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
done here the actual procedural rules
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
that he referenced we filed the uh
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
request for fiscal impact statement last
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
evening so those rules will be um moving
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
forward and I've met with him to discuss
 
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.110 align:start position:0%
forward and I've met with him to discuss
our

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
approach okay represent Bara
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
so the words proposed rules seem
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
nebulous to me what does that mean a
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
proposed rule I mean proposed fine I'm
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
sorry prop it is the starting point for
 
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
sorry prop it is the starting point for
their

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
because hazardous waste management is
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are people and
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
organizations of all sizes who are
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with this and I'm concerned that
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
you would get your naive or firsttime
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
user getting in charge okay you violated
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
the rules here's your here's your $3,000
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
a day fine for 10 days and just you know
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
say oh God I'm stuck and pay it whereas
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
a more experienced person would know
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
that's just the starting
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
point and so it's
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
easily uh subject
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
to what we call informal Ru making and
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
you know some people get a better deal
 
00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
you know some people get a better deal
than

00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
others well so the proposed F would be
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
in a notice and we would have a hearing
 
00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
and there would be a decision rendered
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
that the hearing is is mandatory you
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't just let somebody mail in a check
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
and avoid the
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
hassle if they were going to go through
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
the adjudicative process correct there
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
could be U settlement agreements that
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
take place Madam chair repres BR what if
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
we were to say that rather than proposed
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
fines we have up to ,000 or up to
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
whatever the fine is because proposed is
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
rather I I just think I think that's
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
just too
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh that's just doesn't mean anything to
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
me if I were to get
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
that I would say something more
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
something more people are accustomed is
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
the word up to up to $1,500 or up to
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
3,000 I mean how does that sit with you
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
well the statute does provide the
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
department with authority up to $2,000
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
per violation and the statute requires
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
that we adopt rules to establish a
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
schedule of administrative fines that's
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
what these are and so there's been an
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation from the Department staff as
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
propose director Boral um
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
in response to representative groda it
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
just to clarify it's not that the fine
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
itself is proposed which would mean well
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
are you going to do a fine or not it's a
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
specific amount that is proposed and
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
then there is a variation on that
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances that
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
would be in uh the draft initial
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
proposal which by the way is a part of
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request meeting
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
packet it's at the end of it if you wish
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
to look at it
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
yeses lying so again yeah I'm looking at
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
that last page of the conditional
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
approval page 12 and it does have like a
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
range so it explains like what the
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
default is giving given just a charge of
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
a uh of a minor potential for harm as
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
well as a minor deviation it says the
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
default 250 but then there's a range of
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
100 to 500 so the more you know the the
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
nuanced piece of that can be adjusted
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
and dealt with and that's true for all
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
of these and I'm assuming there' have to
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
be a determination in the adjudicated
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
process what is a that this is a minor
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
deviation and has minor potential for
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
harm and therefore it's a
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
$250 um default fine and adjusted from
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
there but I guess they did put structure
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
around it um and they do Define above um
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
what a major deviation of the
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
requirement is what a um moderate
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
potential for harm is they do
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
definitions in there as well so I think
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's they they put sides you know you on
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
on the road for that they can't cross
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
over on either side but left it so it
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
case director uh regarding the language
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
that representative grotus suggested um
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's staff's interpretation of the
 
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
statute that in one place it says up to
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
$2,000 so that would be the maximum but
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
then the statute also specifically
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
requires that the agency adopt a
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
schedule of fund
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
we would interpret that as to mean they
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
need to put fairly specific
 
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
amounts and uh also saying up to $2,000
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
I know we've made comments in the past
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
uh committee hasn't always made a
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
objection on it but if you simply say up
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
to $2,000 then what's the criteria
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
between a $100 fine and a $2,000 fine
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
okay where it appears that they have
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the table they've got from a
 
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
default fine of 250 for a minor
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
potential minor deviation up to $2,000
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
if it's a major deviation and major
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
potential for harm which strikes me as
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
re as that's fine I withdraw my concern
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay Senator uh just a comment I I saw
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
this as a way for the Department to give
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
an indication of what they thought the
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
severity was by either picking the
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
default or picking a higher or lower
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
number so I'm perfectly comfortable with
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
it and I will move the
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
item okay
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
comments yes represent hacken Phillips
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
uh does the um agency believe that the
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
$2,000 threshold is an appropriate
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
amount to
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh you know thwart these
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
types of um
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
um I guess potential for harm yeah I'm
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
just thinking you know $2,000 on the
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
grand scheme of things in my mind just
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering you know if that is
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
really an appropriate amount should we
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
be considering for future legislation
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
maybe a higher threshold to thwart some
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
of these like you know possible
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
hazardous um environmental damage thank
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question I I am aware that
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
there are other statutes that have been
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
changed I think fairly recently to 4,000
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to your
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
question that' be really a policy matter
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
that I think the uh Department would
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
reach out to the legislature if if we
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that we had that Authority I
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
think we um we would absolutely reach
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
out and seek that thank
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
you okay um as I re as I remember from
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
last month these rules have
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
been uh expired for 15 years or so that
 
00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:05.390 align:start position:0%
been uh expired for 15 years or so that
is

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
correct and I did you find out when you
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
got that information from the attorney
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
general that was okay to work without
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
rules I believe it was early on in the
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
process but it you know wasn't in
 
00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.069 align:start position:0%
process but it you know wasn't in
writing

00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
um and as I said we we stopped that this
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner issued in order stopping
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
that practice what we're here today is
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
to is to correct where we are and I
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
think as I represented the last time
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
this is one of the programs there are
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
others that we're working on that will
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
be coming before you which is why we
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
felt it appropriate to adjust our
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
procedural rules to address the concerns
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.230 align:start position:0%
of the
committee

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
okay yes Senator so again representative
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips point just remember some
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
of these fines aren't are per incident
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
fine so you may have five incidents that
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
are rolled up and it'll be a $10,000
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
fine because each incident subject up to
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
$22,000 so it's a cumulative fine not
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
per incident not necessarily a holistic
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
whole F
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
Well I'm particularly concerned that
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
with a program that was operating under
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
verbal instructions from the attorney
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
general that they didn't need a rule
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
when the law was changed to say expire
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
rules cannot be
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
enforced they didn't even bother to get
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that opinion in writing so I understand
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
you have a new commissioner but I think
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
you ought to take that back to the
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
people that were there
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
working obliviously to the law for years
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
I share your concern I could tell you
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
know the department has 133 chapters of
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules I believe I've
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
counted them before and
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
um I can represent to you I I've been in
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
this job for three years and is a
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
priority of the department not to let
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
any of their rules expire this is one of
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
133 and we are here to correct the
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
issues going forward but I I hear your
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
concern I've represented that to the
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the department is well
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
aware that's a con concern of this
 
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.230 align:start position:0%
aware that's a con concern of this
committee

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right do we have any motion Jim
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
already moved it ice second it has been
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
moved all right any further
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
game um this is uh 2023 187 sporting
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
club youth feasant events um Kim
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
indicated that she has no comments on
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
the proposal the only reason it's before
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
the committee is that these rules
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
expired in May of this year um the rules
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
are for annual pheasant hunting events
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh for Youth and generally generally
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
these occur in the fall so it may be
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
that they've not enforced the rule since
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
May but that would be a question for the
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
Department morning yeah good morning um
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
Berg I'm the chief of the wildlife
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
division um that is correct these
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
there's actually only been two of these
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
events uh since
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
2012 um there were there were two
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
different dates of expiration in the
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
rules um and it was it was a mistake by
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
us that we missed we missed the second
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
um you'll notice that section H um was
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
up to date and the rest had expired um
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
there has not been an event since these
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
rules expired in May
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
so figured that but director moral I
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
would note that there is a conditional
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
approval request for this thank you move
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
to conditionally approved
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none those in favor I
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very much
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh so the board of education has an
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
interim rule
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
2023 D6
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
um and they have requested that this be
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
postponed so that they can work on a
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request the jail C
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
deadline is until January 3rd so if the
 
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
committee chooses to postpone there's no
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
issue there okay do we have a motion so
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
moved discussion those in favor I I
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank you very that was
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
easy all right do we have any
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
information on the objection responses
 
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.870 align:start position:0%
information on the objection responses
yet

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
believe um yes for the first one 2020
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
3116 uh from Board of Engineers I
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
believe the agency is going to ask for a
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
revised preliminary objection to address
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
comments so moved um although I I think
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
we should hear from the agency about
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
that okay this is just my understanding
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%

regarding this and there are a few more
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
things that needed to be that we need to
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
work on so that's why we're requesting
 
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.309 align:start position:0%
work on so that's why we're requesting

section in AGR
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
700 uh it that section by itself uh
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
really doesn't work it needs the other
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
rules around it which are also expired
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%

morning hit the button buttons on the on
 
00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:48.829 align:start position:0%
morning hit the button buttons on the on
the

00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%

um again in in our response we apologize
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
to committee for not being represented
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
on um August 17th um new to the position
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
and there was a miscommunication that
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would be here in my
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
stad um so we have corrected some of the
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
concerns and um have initiated uh the
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
full chapter um it's actually supposed
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
to be in the register today so uh we
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on November 15th
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee so I I just Madam chair excuse
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
me represent hacken Phils has a question
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
or comment so I just want to make sure
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this correctly that
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
the rule 700 section really does need
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
the complement of the remaining
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding section to make sense that
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
is correct but today we're just um
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the 700 section just one
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
particular section within 700 okay thank
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
you I have a question about so once
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
we once we get to the approval of these
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
rules does that mean that the Department
 
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture is all up to date with
 
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.670 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture is all up to date with
their

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:23.559 align:start position:0%
rules uh no the department has a number
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
of chapters that are expired
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but I think as far as the 700s U that
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
should take care of
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
this so I guess my comment and I guess
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's to the
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
committee not to ol at all and then and
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
the agencies is that we hear about these
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
expired rules and when they're a year or
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
two you can understand that but this is
 
00:49:56.589 --> 00:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
2008 and previously it was 2009
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
so how is it that this happens I I
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
just there's there yes please um the
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
department has never had to my knowledge
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
any person to do their rulem uh Patricia
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
was hired specifically to do that uh
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
earlier this year and hopefully they are
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to be moving forward with all
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
their expired
 
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.510 align:start position:0%
their expired
rules

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you glad to hear
 
00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
that right so Madam chair I guess my
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
question is we can we can still approve
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
705 this rule knowing that they're
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
coming forward correct yes I move to
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
approve second okay second by Senator
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
gray any
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very much
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
rules uh with regard to the Department
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services the fost
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
family care licensing requirements the
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
department did file their revised
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
objection response I have had an
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at it based on the
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
reasons for the revised objection I did
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
not have any additional comments and I
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
do believe the changes address them uh
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
just to remind the committee the issues
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
that needed to be addressed on the
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
revised objection response were that the
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
department had to make clear that the
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
mandator immunizations were for adult
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
caregivers as it just said all household
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
caregivers so they did make that change
 
00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:35.270 align:start position:0%
caregivers so they did make that change
and

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
additionally they also changed the
 
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
requirement um or the recommendations
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
from those number of agencies from just
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
saying the immunizations to specifying
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's the number of immunization doses
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
dosage route of administration spacing
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
in a age to make it clear that they're
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
not going on the recommendations of
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
which immunizations need to be required
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
just how the ones that are required
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
under the state statutes need to be
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
administered so I would say that this
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
does address that and then additionally
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
they threw in an additional paragraph
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
saying that no additional immunization
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
shall be required for children who are
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
household members of a foster care home
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
other than immunizations that are
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
required for other schoolage children in
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
the state so I would I have no further
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.829 align:start position:0%

business uh this morning you will see in

addition to the agenda at your stations

there's also a package with a number of
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
forms that have been revised by OS these
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
forms have been revised due to the
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
updates to 541a and also
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
91a um and I could very briefly go over
 
00:53:50.789 --> 00:53:50.799 align:start position:0%
the changes um the first one which is
 
00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
the ru making notice form the only two
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
changes were that we are asking agencies
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
to include whether a rule Implement
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
implements a state statute for the first
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
time that is just something that we've
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
done on our own based on conversations
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
that we've been having um with uh other
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
members of the uh committee as well as
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
other staff um for the House of
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives um just to make it
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
easier for people to know whether a rule
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
is either implementing a statute for the
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
first time or as we're
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
seeing needed to be implemented before
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
but is now just starting to be
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
implemented the other change to this
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
form is that we've included information
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
for the agency to put on whether or not
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
a hearing will also be available
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
electronically that is in response to a
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
change to 91a which does allow agencies
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
to have electronic hearings or hybrid
 
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
hearings however that um change I don't
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
believe applies to boards and
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
commissions just
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
yet the next form is the Contin uation
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
of ruem hearing once again just
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
including information should an agency
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
want to do a hearing electronically or a
 
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.829 align:start position:0%
want to do a hearing electronically or a
hybrid

00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
hybrid
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
hearing um the extension of public
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
comment deadline also the same change
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
due to 91a for the electronic
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearings um change in electronic access
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
for virtual hearing or hybrid rulemaking
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
hearing this one is um new in response
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
to 91a to to allow the agency to publish
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
more information for the public so that
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
they can attend a hearing electronically
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
should they wish
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
and next would be the cover sheet for
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
the final proposal this one has a number
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
of new changes due to the uh updates in
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
541a the first is the requirement that
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
an agency has
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
to in addition to the final proposal
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
also submit a report or summary of the
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
public comments received on the initial
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
proposal and explain how those were
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
addressed on the final proposal so just
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
like an incorporation by reference
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
statement that's something that they
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
have to file with the final proposal
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
additionally we are now requiring that
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%

statute there is also a new process with
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
regard to fiscal impact statements the
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
statute was amended to allow an agency
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
to request an amend fiscal impact
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
statement um and so that has also been
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
included on this form whether or not the
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
agency has asked and received an amended
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%

00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
91a any questions from the committee
 
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.400 align:start position:0%

01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
that rule imple
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
implementation in straford County there
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
is a housing project of 76 units and
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
that has a $100,000
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
cost every penny count in
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
this right now the interest rate this
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
morning is
 
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
8.42% so every $10,000 that gets
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
transferred to the
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
consumer to your
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
constituents they'll be paying almost
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
$228,000 by the end of that
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage it counts if we had known from
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
when I contacted New Hampshire Dees I
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
asked if there was an executive summary
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the rule is it because I was given a
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
short window between notification and
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
the public hearing I asked if there was
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
an executive summary available no there
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
was not I asked what happened if a if a
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative or a senator asked for an
 
01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:40.430 align:start position:0%
representative or a senator asked for an
executive

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
summary I was told we'll answer their
 
01:01:43.119 --> 01:01:44.870 align:start position:0%
summary I was told we'll answer their
specific

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
question but don't worry about it it's
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic in nature there's no impact
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
to builders no impact to agencies this
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
not even
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
close and so we're asking Jal car to
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
please consider revisiting that Vote or
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
staying that rule
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
or give us time to work with Dees on
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
this so we fully understand the impact
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
that's only two
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
Builders that's
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
$350,000 on two projects when we need
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
every stick of housing we can get so
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're asking you please consider your
 
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:28.839 align:start position:0%
vote please allow us time to work with
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
Dees and come back to you with a revised
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
rule that works for everyone guess them
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
what they want and helps us keep
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
building houses
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
please director moral um Mr Mayberry
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
could you indicate what particular rule
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
or rules
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh have this problem and what
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
specifically the problem is or how it
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
increases the cost absolutely Madam
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
chair I have to go to fiscal but just
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the Committees it was on the August
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
17th agenda it was item number 2023
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
136 which should help you uh look it up
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
if you need to and I apologize for
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
having to go to Fisco that's that's fine
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
the as I recall that was on consent and
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
I was astonished that that kind of a
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
rule was on consent with no
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
comments but there weren't
 
01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.549 align:start position:0%
comments but there weren't
any

01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
when when anyone tells me it's
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic in nature you can relax I'm
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
going to relax um so sir um what we're
 
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
doing now is Santa gray requested that
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
information we're working with the
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
engineers who are much smarter than I am
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
on what word or words triggered
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
these changes so we're trying to get
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
that that request came in last night I
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
sent it to the engineers that involved
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
in at least of the two project
 
01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
referenced here so we're working on that
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
sir okay any mam yes so my understanding
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
is I don't know that we can necessarily
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
go back and revisit and revote a ruled
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
especially from a month and a half ago
 
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
um however what we could do is petition
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
the agency my understanding is they have
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
not implemented the rule yet um and if
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
they even if they have we can ask them
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
to either Implement an emergency rule
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
due to the fiscal impact of the citizens
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire they'd be allowed to do
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
an emergency rule to address this
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
housing being the critical nature that
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
it is um and the cost of housing being a
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
critical nature of it is I I I'd rather
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
not have a rule that's creating
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
significant impact to our developers and
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
trying to implement housing in the state
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so my motion would be
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
to petition the agency to stay the rule
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
and if they've already implemented the
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
rule to bring forth an emergency rule
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
that may assist um and work with the
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
home builders to get craft that
 
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.230 align:start position:0%
home builders to get craft that
emergency

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
rule mam chair yes uh Pam excuse me Pam
 
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
Monroe from the dep department is here
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
if you wouldd like to ask the department
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
any questions okay thank you Senator
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
chandley I'll withdraw my motion till we
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
here thank you madam chair and and that
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
is partly what concerns me is I am not
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
prepared to act on this in any way even
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
staying a rule um at this point I just
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
feel I this is the very first um I've
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
heard about it I haven't seen any letter
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
I did check my email I'm I'm sorry
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
you're not in my email list so I'm
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
having a little more difficulty that's I
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
am not I'm just saying the nature is
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
that this is really an Abrupt change and
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
that I I think that you know to act on
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
something in such haste could be
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
dangerous and set a very bad precedent
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm totally sympathetic and I I
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
respect what um Senator Lang said about
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
um we we need every stick of housing um
 
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
however let's do this thoughtfully and
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you I tend to get
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
represent BR I agree with what Senator
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
Chanley said and furthermore I'd like to
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
know what the house bill was that
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
prompted this and what the intent of
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
that bill was because this is all you
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
just don't establish rules without
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
legislation correct so I'd like to
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
backtrack it that far it's if it was
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
started as housekeeping updates the the
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain rules might have
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
just come up for review um before they
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
expired I don't remember specifically
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
any but there could be some
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
legislation uh I agree with Senate
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
Chanley myself I would strongly
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that as the home builders are
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
figuring out which which parts are bad
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
they formally write a letter to the
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner and request him to revise
 
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.349 align:start position:0%
commissioner and request him to revise
the

01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
rule that will give the agency 30 days
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with an
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
answer and will it it will at least put
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
them on notice that there are concerns
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
in a bill in a rule that they were
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
advertising as minor technical cleanup
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am but we have projects in the in
 
01:07:29.069 --> 01:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
the pipeline right now that are being
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
delayed well we'll continue it too but
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
in any it it certainly will stake out
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
misinformed director and I think Senator
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
Lang mentioned that uh and for the newer
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
committee members the committee cannot
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
to now uh make a change to a rule that's
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
already been adopted that can only be
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
done in the same committee meeting uh it
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
used to be that you could do that
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
subsequently but it ran into some
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
serious problems in doing that so the
 
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee in its own rules decided that
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
if you were going to make a change to a
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
rule that had been voted on it had to be
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
done at the same meeting okay so Senor l
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
so again my understanding again my my
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
motion for petition for them to seek
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
possible emergency rule making was for
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
that reason was because they'd have to
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
go through all new rule Mak proc process
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
hearings and everything else I guess to
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
adapt change the rule again which will
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
delay six months I think is our process
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
for public hearings and everything else
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
by a petition to ask them to visit in
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
possible emergency rules doesn't mean
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
they have to do that it just is saying
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
that we want you to look at this because
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
that is an impact on the Hampshire
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
housing that was an unintended
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
consequence they doesn't force them to
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
do an emergency rule it just says that
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
we identified an issue that has
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
significant potential cost effect to our
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
citizens which is one of the conditions
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
of an emergency rule is is um financial
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
and it would allow them they can say no
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
we looked at it we don't want to do an
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
emergency Rule and that's fine but it
 
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
just says that the this board would like
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
them to at least review it and look at
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
it and and it makes them respond in a
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and not just ignore a
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
Citizens requests I think that we should
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
put that on the agenda for the next
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
meeting so that we are able to in the
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
meantime look at whatever the initial
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
letter from the home builders and
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever other date
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
they have to show us and also reread the
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
rule may may I just ask can I just ask a
 
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
question Mr maybery the thing I'm I want
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm understanding
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
is are are you saying that the that the
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
department of of Environmental Services
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
has has said in these cases you point
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
out has said
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
listen um we this would have this what
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
you're doing would have been fine under
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
the old rule uh but now the rule has
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
been changed and it's now because of
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
this change that we're saying we're
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
taking a different position than we took
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
before or that's what they're saying so
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
their position is not what you were
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
doing before would have been a problem
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
anyway uh but this now it's now even a
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
clearer problem correct in the um in the
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
letter you'll see a a case from
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley in which the developer
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
went to the state and said are we the
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
beta test on this you know how are we
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
working these um they had been they
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
submitted an
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
application was approved and through
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
that approval
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
process this rule was introduced and
 
01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.510 align:start position:0%
process this rule was introduced and
everything

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
changed and so they had to re-engineer
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
re environmental study and come up with
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
new Retention Ponds that caused a
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
$250,000 increase because of that rule
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
so you're correct sir has that rule gone
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
into effect yes ma'am
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and it applied to a pro a project in
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
process yes ma'am two
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
projects and I've submitted to my 500
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
members please send us if this rule is
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
affecting you please come through
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
because santra I completely agree this
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
is on a short schedule for
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
everyone that we're asking all of our
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
members send us your testimony if this
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
is impacting you please come through and
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
these first two jump in right away
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
saying it's hitting Us in the between
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
the eyes it's in effect right now that's
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
why we're asking for a
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
stay yeah I mean you know the other I
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
guess I I I completely agree with the
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
senator on on this I mean and I think
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're doing because the
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
problem I have is this I you may be
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
completely right but you know I I guess
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see the language I don't
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
know what the language of the old rule
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
was or the language of the new rule was
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
and what exactly the change is and so so
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
without you know you may be completely
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
right but I think before we take any
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
action we ought to have you know we
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
ought to know the whole story so to
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
speak that's and my concern is that I
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
think we don't right now absolutely
 
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.470 align:start position:0%
think we don't right now absolutely
completely

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
agree yes representative
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
grassy yeah I would have to agree of of
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
holding on to this because one of the
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
concerns I have in this is that it's
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
talking it seems to be it's talking
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
about bio retention uh ponds and their
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
construction and uh this is something I
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
have a a little bit of expertise in and
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
the concern that I have about this is if
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
I I want to know how this is going to
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
affect communities because we have storm
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
water management requirements and
 
01:12:33.629 --> 01:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
communities now the federal government
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
has passed down that are very costly to
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of local communities and this may
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
be something that would just
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
transferring a cost from one side to
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
another side that you know that a
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
developer may be able to reduce cost but
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
then the taxpayers are going to have to
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
pick it up on the other side that's the
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
only concern I would have that we take
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
our time before we move move ahead with
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
this to take a look at how it affects
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
both sides of that equation okay Senator
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
and finally I just want to make sure I
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
understand it's I I you uh I don't think
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
you moved it but you suggest we put this
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
on the next agenda um would that be in
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
two weeks or would
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
we you would it be a continued meeting
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
or direct we haven't there's a continued
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
meeting that is scheduled that we have
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
not yet cancelled uh director do we have
 
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
anything else that would be appropriate
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
for that uh no I I think the items we've
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
postponed have all been to the next
 
01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.709 align:start position:0%
postponed have all been to the next
regular

01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
meeting okay so it would probably be in
 
01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:33.390 align:start position:0%
meeting okay so it would probably be in
a

01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
month correct okay unless unless someone
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
moves to make having a continued meeting
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
simply to address that
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
issue all right anyone
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
else okay director I would note that um
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
with Senator Lang's motion or idea to
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
have the agency respond I think it's
 
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
going to be very difficult for them
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
unless they know the rules that uh are
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
problem I would do
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
that okay so the more information you
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
can get us and the sooner the better
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for Mr
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
Mayberry yes ma'am and and we'll also uh
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
petition the uh Commissioner of Dees
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll include that letter
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
for all of you and thank you for your
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
time and your consideration I know you
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
have a lot on your agenda but thank you
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
and if the agency what is here I'd like
 
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
to find out what their side of this is
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
because it uh it's rather
 
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
shocking you on the meeting
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
