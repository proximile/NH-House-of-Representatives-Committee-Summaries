law committee uh I am proud to introduce
 
00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 align:start position:0%
House Bill 115 relative to changing the
 
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
date of the state primary election this
 
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
bill moves the state primary election to
 
00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
the second Tuesday in June the house
 
00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
supported a June primary bill in 2021
 
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
and in 2022 when finalizing the second
 
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
Tuesday in June we meaning myself in the
 
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
sponsorship team wanted to make the
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
primary as late as desirable for the
 
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
sponsorship team while still ensuring it
 
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
would be far earlier than our current
 
00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
September primary September primaries
 
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 align:start position:0%
support the incumbent elected official
 
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
in whatever office that they hold it'll
 
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
only allows for a seven-week general
 
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
election period that detracts from the
 
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
ability of freshly minted party nominees
 
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
and Challengers to campaign in a general
 
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
election environment and a growing
 
00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 align:start position:0%
consensus of both Republicans and
 
00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 align:start position:0%
Democrats are in agreement that
 
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
September primaries are just too late
 
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
for the process of the general election
 
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
to start months deep into the summer
 
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
months deep in the summer for vacation
 
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
should be avoided as well if only to
 
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
ensure the highest level of voter
 
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
engagement and attention is paid towards
 
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
the primary election July and August to
 
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
me are out of the question for such a
 
00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
primary election as Granite Staters are
 
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
out of state and spending time with
 
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
their families and shouldn't be bothered
 
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
with Party politics a June primary
 
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
allows for granite Staters to focus on
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
the preceding two months in April and
 
00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 align:start position:0%
May while voting in June this would
 
00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
allow then both parties and their
 
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
nominees the opportunity to organize and
 
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
unite over the course of the summer
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
months and really get into gear right as
 
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
Labor Day weekend kicks off into the
 
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 align:start position:0%
general election Sprint of the fall this
 
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
will allow the campaigns to communicate
 
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
with granite Staters at large right
 
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
after Labor Day when folks really do
 
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
start to pay attention in Earnest
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
towards our elections we in state
 
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
government should always be looking for
 
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
practical solutions that make our
 
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
current processes and systems more
 
00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
efficient and pragmatic holding our
 
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
state primary on the second Tuesday in
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
June does that and I asked the committee
 
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
for their support of this important
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you and I'll take any
 
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.589 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you and I'll take any
questions

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
well that was unexpected saying no
 
00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
questions um thank you representative
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you very much
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
next up uh we're going to have the
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
representative from the Secretary of
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
State's office a senior deputy secretary
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
of state uh Patricia Lovejoy
 
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you chairman uh I just
 
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to present where the Secretary of
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
State's office sits on this bill
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
our preference would be to move the
 
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
election a couple of weeks earlier than
 
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
what it is right now right now
 
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
there's a there's always an issue of
 
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get the yukava ballots out on
 
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
time and the last um election cycle we
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
added post-election audits that happened
 
00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 align:start position:0%
and immediately after the election so
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on
 
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
um in a very short period of time so our
 
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
preference would be to move it forward a
 
00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 align:start position:0%
few weeks
 
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
but that being said if the decision is
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
to move it to June we will obviously be
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
there to support and make sure that the
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
election is is done well in June that's
 
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.770 align:start position:0%
election is is done well in June that's
all

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Baum
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you question
 
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
aren't there at least 12 other states
 
00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
having their Primary in August
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
I do not know the exact number I know
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is just about at that same
 
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.689 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is just about at that same
time

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
um a couple weeks before ours
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many other states
 
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.570 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many other states
are

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
well look at this we're moving fast
 
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
today seeing none thank you Deputy
 
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
senior Deputy Lovejoy
 
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:05:59.039 --> 00:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
um

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
actually you're a co-sponsor the bills
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
so it's I guess the rules do allow you
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
to be the chair you just can't uh
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
question or participate in the
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
questioning is that correct yeah I'm not
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
familiar but I have no intention of
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
asking questions so good okay well
 
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
your questions are good if uh when the
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
when you ask them but anyway so I'm
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh I I submitted a written
 
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
testimony to the website against both
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
these bills and I'm much more and um
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
I almost thought you were uh introducing
 
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
HB 333 to have a proposal that everyone
 
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
was really going to hate and then
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
somehow this one wouldn't seem as bad
 
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
but I think it's still a bad idea
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
it's notwithstanding what uh the members
 
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
said to Manchester I feel exactly the
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
opposite I think the late primary is
 
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
useful for incumbents it gives them uh
 
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
more time to prepare a campaign more
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
time to make a case and I can speak from
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
personal experience because I had a
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
I had a gentleman uh jumping into the
 
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.469 align:start position:0%
I had a gentleman uh jumping into the
race

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
race
 
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
here in Stratford District 10. I'm
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Horrigan from
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
Stratford tens which is the town of
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
Durham so one of my neighbors jumped at
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
the races June ran a very good campaign
 
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.010 align:start position:0%
the races June ran a very good campaign
and

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.730 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
I only beat him by four votes in the
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
recount so I think that would have been
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
much less likely to happen if he'd had
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
to make the decision if he'd had too
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
fewer months to make to this decision
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
back in April um and um
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
and also like you didn't have all summer
 
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
both of us didn't have all summer to
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
like ramp up our campaign even as it is
 
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
um it feels like we're campaigning the
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
whole time and both of these bills will
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
make that uh much worse um so I I think
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
a later primary is actually beneficial
 
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
to incumbents what the member from
 
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
Manchester may have met is that
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
democratic incumbents
 
00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
except for the governors uh for races
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
the top particular races below the
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
governor have done very very well in the
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
last several Cycles um but I don't think
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's a function of the primary date I
 
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
think that's a function of the quality
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
of candidates who've made it through the
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
Republican primary process they just
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
weren't um
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
they just weren't as strong in the
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
opinion of the uh electorate as the as
 
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
the Democrats and I don't I think if
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
anything that incumbency advantage would
 
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.730 align:start position:0%
anything that incumbency advantage would
be

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
um even even worse with an earlier
 
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.029 align:start position:0%
um even even worse with an earlier
primary

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:23.809 align:start position:0%
primary
um

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
also the current calendar is very good
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
for uh candidates who are members of the
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
legislature because uh the filing window
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
was right about right not is right
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
around the end of the uh end of the
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
session so that's a good time for us to
 
00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
session so that's a good time for us to
decide

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
what we want to do going forward and
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
that applies not just to uh those
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
wrestling running for election but also
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
that those of us who move up to the
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
senate or even those of us who want to
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
run for top of the ticket offices for
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
example uh
 
00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:54.019 align:start position:0%
Senate uh Senate president president
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
Morris the former Senator president uh
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
ran for con uh ran for Congress and fell
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
fell a little short but I think it would
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
have been harder for him to make that uh
 
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.829 align:start position:0%
have been harder for him to make that uh
decision

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
um if he'd still been in the middle of
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
being the Senate President so and he ran
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the U.S Senate I'm sorry if these uh
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
so I think I think just a fair thing to
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
do is to keep the calendar more or less
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
the way it is um as for an August
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
primary I've actually submitted bills in
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
the past for the August primary
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
and it didn't get very far but the idea
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
has a lot of Merit and this bill could
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
possibly use as a vehicle for that um I
 
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.150 align:start position:0%
possibly use as a vehicle for that um I
know

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.050 align:start position:0%
know
um

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
I think Massachusetts still has a
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
September primary I know specifically
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont has a mid-august primary and
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
New York State's primary was August 23rd
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
and I know that because I was a looking
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
at the situation with George Santos
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
because one of the things with primary
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
dates a longer primary and he actually
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
his primaries on August 23rd so he
 
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
actually had a late summer primary and
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
still felt and you know still you know
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
fell through the cracks but the later
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
primary does give us more time to weed
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
out you know extremely bad
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
um candidates such as him while giving
 
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
um candidates such as him while giving
uh

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
well giving like Insurgent candidates
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
more time to prepare their race like the
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
gentleman who nearly beat me in Durham
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
and or to name another example my
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
neighbor Bruce Fenton who ran for the
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
U.S Senate and was totally unknown but
 
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
he um
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
did manage you know he did manage to at
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
least uh you know get on the radar or
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
get in the debates and that probably
 
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
also would not have been the case if
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
he'd had to like uh file like way back
 
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:38.459 align:start position:0%
in uh March as this bill proposes or
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
even earlier is the other one so I think
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we should leave it more
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
though more or less the way it is if you
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
want to move the primary up to late
 
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:48.740 align:start position:0%
August which is not really a problem uh
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
these schools are already uh schools
 
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
already open in August the families
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
maybe Governor sununa family spends the
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
entire uh Summer from Memorial Day
 
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
through Labor Day at the lake or
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
whatever but most families uh you know
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
most families take only relatively brief
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
vacations during the summer and most of
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
them are probably back in their uh
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
fall routines by late August so
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
for so I urge you uh urge you certainly
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
not to pass this bill
 
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.140 align:start position:0%
unless you want to actually extend
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
unless you actually want to have an
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
August primaries otherwise a June
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
primary it's not as ridiculous as the
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
other idea that I'll be talking about in
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
a few minutes but it's still a bad idea
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
thanks are there any questions from the
 
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
committee representative Howard sorry
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
everybody has to be patient with me I'm
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
learning new name so representative
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan being a
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative from Durham uh what
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of your voters are students
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
it's uh well about half of the names in
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
the checklist are are student student
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
voters and that's actually
 
00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.569 align:start position:0%
voters and that's actually
um

00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
one thing with the the current
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
current primary I think is a good thing
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
is that the uh
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
this also affects when people uh have to
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
declare they have to can register for
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
voting and declare their party
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
affiliation right now that fits in
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
pretty well with the student calendar
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they're showing up in August and
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
actually an earlier primary might be
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
problematic from that standpoint but uh
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah so it's uh they they vote
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
they haven't actually been starting to
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
vote with more numbers than the primary
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
and recent recent years so that's uh
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
they've been I think the later
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
generation of the students um including
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
yourself although your father is also
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
State Rep candidates here from a
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
political family but I think young
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
people are more and more recognizing
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
that it's not just the general election
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
that the primaries are also important
 
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:48.260 align:start position:0%
and are participating so
 
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.769 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh thank you representative
 
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.889 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh thank you representative

relative to changing the primary date of
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
the state primary election and adding a
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
runoff election if necessary so we'll be
 
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:48.710 align:start position:0%
yeah
foreign

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.720 --> 00:45:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
um it's 10 45 I'm gonna hold on opening
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
the hearing back up because we don't
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
have our committee assessment again I
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're being live streamed
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
yet so if the committee will indulge me
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll go find our assistant make
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
sure that the good people watching at
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
home can get their Youtube footage so
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go figure out what's going on
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
never mind representative representative
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
Howard has informed me we are streaming
 
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
so I will I will now open up the hearing
 
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh on HB 333 fiscal note relative to
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
changing the date of the state primary
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
election and adding a runoff election if
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
necessary I'll recognize the Bill's
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
sponsor a representative Joe Sweeney of
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
man Salem uh excuse me uh representative
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
Sweeney you are recognized welcome to
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
election law thank you very much acting
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
chairman Barry and the members of the
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
health selection law committee I will
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually be very brief and quick on this
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
bill HB 333 I am proud to introduce it
 
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
today and I'm sure we will hear from my
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
good friend the member from Somersworth
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
later on this bill as well however I am
 
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to retain this
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislation the legislation would set up
 
00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
a primary election on town meeting day
 
00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
in March and then if candidates for U.S
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
Senate Congress in in the governor's
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
office do not reach 50 percent of their
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
primary vote for the nomination a runoff
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
would be had uh between the top two
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
finishers so that a candidate would get
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
50 percent there are a number of bills
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
that deal with this sort of similar sort
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
of vein of thinking of trying to get the
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
candidates that are nominated by a party
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
to be uh 50 plus support from the party
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh different bills with different policy
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
recommendations whether they be runoff
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
elections approval voting rank Choice
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
voting for this bill I would I would
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
just ask the committee to retain it so
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we can continue studying it I think
 
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
we'll see other pieces of legislation
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
that deal with it and I don't want to
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
prematurely have the house take a
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
position on the policy without a
 
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
retention committee subcommittee which
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to serve as a non-member of
 
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
election law on uh but that is that is
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
my hope today is that when you guys do
 
00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
exact this uh this Bill gets retained
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
but I am happy to take any questions on
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
the underlying policy
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:47:59.579 --> 00:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Lane thank you Mr
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Sweeney do you
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
have a preferred alternative to your
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
bill like you mentioned ranked Choice
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
voting are there other things that you
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
would prefer in lieu of this uh thank
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh not without
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
studying all varying options and seeing
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
really what is the best system that
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
other states employ to get nominees from
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
parties that the majority plus of a
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
party support so I'm not willing to
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
commit today to what else I would
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
support but I'm open to have the
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
conversation as legislation should be
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative qualey
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney for talking with
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
us today
 
00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:51.109 align:start position:0%
us today
uh

00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
looking at at the bill on
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
page two down near the bottom line
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
25 if you say that
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
the candidate shall file with the
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate official between the first
 
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
Wednesday in March is that a typo
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
that is a typo and it's a further reason
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
for the retention uh this bill was with
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
the OLS
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
um situation that we dealt with
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
um this Bill had two I I wanted to get
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
two redrafts and I was only able to get
 
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:22.940 align:start position:0%
one redraft in um the original version
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh had those mistakes in it as well as
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
it applied to every candidate which was
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
not my intent imagine a state
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative race uh going to a runoff
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
would be a headache for many
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
um so there are other changes to the
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
bill that I do want to pursue but with
 
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
the situation with OLS and redrafting
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
and just the start of the of the
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
legislative session so far with the
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
addition of this having a fiscal note so
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
it would have to be acted on early is
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
why I'm just asking almost retention so
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we can extend the conversation and
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the work on this process and Bill
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up yes I'd like a
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up please thank you
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
you mentioned just now in your testimony
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
about trying to coordinate the this
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
Primary in March with a town meeting day
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
but not all towns have their meeting so
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
there's that another issue you'd like to
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
look at further the resolve absolutely
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I will say as the starting point of
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
the of the policy in the conversation we
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
felt you know town meeting day would be
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
the earliest we could have our state
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
primary and it's actually a little nod
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
to our presidential primary which
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
started on town meeting day over 100
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
years ago when every town essentially
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
had town meeting day elections they
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
didn't want to open up the town hall
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
twice in the the winter for our
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and then we
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
switched it so it's always just one week
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
before but the actual date for
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
presidential primary in statute is town
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
meeting day unless another state tries
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
to go ahead of us and then we do it a
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
week before so that's just kind of the
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
base point of really we talk about
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
moving the primary up earlier and
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
earlier I would say March is as a big
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
supporter of moving the primary up I'd
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
say the second Tuesday in March is the
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
earliest I'm willing to go for the state
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
primary and really just wanted to and
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
with a runoff system that having a
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
runoff off later in May
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
but it really is just a conversation
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
starter not a you know this is the only
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
acceptable time I would have for it okay
 
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions from
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
the committee

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
state uh Lovejoy uh
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
senior Deputy Lovejoy welcome to
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
um again my name is Patricia Lovejoy I
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
am the senior deputy secretary of state
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I've seen here representing Secretary
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
of State we are opposed to this bill we
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
have several reasons that we are opposed
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the first regarding the date in March
 
00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.650 align:start position:0%
um the first regarding the date in March
um

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
we believe that doubling up with
 
00:52:12.609 --> 00:52:12.619 align:start position:0%
Municipal and state elections
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
would create a lot of a lot of problems
 
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
I think that your local issues somebody
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
running for school board or you have a
 
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:24.020 align:start position:0%
town that's trying to do
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
a new police station a fire station
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
Library whatever it is that those local
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
issues will get drowned out in a primary
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
you have the primary for U.S Senate for
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
congress for governor those issues will
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
basically suck all the auction oxygen
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
out of the room I don't we don't think
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's fair for the local issues to be
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
caught up at the same time as the
 
00:52:50.819 --> 00:52:52.329 align:start position:0%
caught up at the same time as the
primaries

00:52:52.329 --> 00:52:52.339 align:start position:0%
primaries
 
00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:54.170 align:start position:0%
primaries
also

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:54.770 align:start position:0%
also
um

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
your the number of ballots that somebody
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
may be having to vote on currently in
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
like my town in March you get three
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
ballots you get one for your local
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
school district then we're part of a
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school district and our town
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
ballot now you'll be adding
 
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:15.740 align:start position:0%
um a fourth ballot
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
in in some Village districts you could
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
be talking as many as five ballots
 
00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
also we have we have concerns regarding
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
um people receiving their absentee
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
ballots the you will call the rules of
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
needing to get ballots out 45 days ahead
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
of time does not apply to Municipal
 
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.770 align:start position:0%
of time does not apply to Municipal
elections

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
so the yukava ballots would be going out
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
45 days ahead of time we also get the
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots to the towns shortly
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
after that so you could have a town
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
having its primary ballots going out say
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
40 days
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
35 40 40 days before the election
 
00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
your town ballots
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
would go out generally later we had
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
issues last year
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
um where several of the school districts
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
did not have their ballots to the towns
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
when the towns were ready to send out
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballots so then the town
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
sent out their Town their Municipal
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
level election
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and then when they got
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
the ones from the school districts then
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
they sent those out so you could be
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
looking at a possibility of Voters
 
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
receiving absentee ballots in three
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
different mailings which I think could
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
be very confusing
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
we also believe
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
in the the issue about a runoff is is
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
one that concerns us in our constitution
 
00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:03.140 align:start position:0%
uh in article two I think it's um
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
sections 33 34 and 42. they all refer to
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
elections being decided by a plurality
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
of votes and in 1912 there was an
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
amendment that specifically changed the
 
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
language from a majority of votes to a
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
plurality of votes so we believe that
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
there is a constitutional issue with
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
this runoff this is something that you
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
will hear me saying this afternoon when
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
we were when we do ranked Choice voting
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
um you know as a general rule the
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is opposed
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
to any legislation where we would not
 
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
know the outcome of election on Election
 
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.849 align:start position:0%
know the outcome of election on Election
night

00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
and one other little wrinkle on this one
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
is the state runs any state level
 
00:56:00.049 --> 00:56:00.059 align:start position:0%
election so the primaries are run by the
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
and the municipalities are responsible
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
for the local elections so you have a
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know a possibility of having two
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
different authorities running these
 
00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:14.390 align:start position:0%
different authorities running these
elections

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
so those are the basic reasons why we uh
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill I'd be willing to take
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lane
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you um Miss
 
00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:33.230 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you um Miss
Lovejoy

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
Lovejoy
 
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:33.950 align:start position:0%
Lovejoy
um

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it and I just want to make
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
sure I heard you right you were that you
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to any change that
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
would delay the results Beyond election
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
night did I hear that correctly yes
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
could you explain follow-up follow-up of
 
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
course could you explain why uh
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
we we have a real history here in New
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of always having those um
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
election results available uh when you
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
are talking about a runoff election and
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
um you're going to end up with those
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
ballots all having to come to Concord to
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
be able to appropriately do a runoff a
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
runoff election if you're talking at the
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
U.S Senate Governor you name it level
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
um it will the delay in finding out
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
who is is elected will take or who's
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
going to be on the ballot will take
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
quite a while and if you're looking at a
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
presidential primary I can't remember if
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically I know when the
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon ones specifically talks about
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
presidential election uh not knowing the
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
results of New Hampshire's first in the
 
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.589 align:start position:0%
results of New Hampshire's first in the
nation

00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
presidential primary on Election night
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
would I think be a pretty significant
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
issue for the state
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up sibling you know so
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative Muirhead thank you Mr
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
um on the on the matter of plurality and
 
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.730 align:start position:0%
um on the on the matter of plurality and
majority

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
um I understand from your testimony the
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
believes it would be unconstitutional
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to require a
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
majority even though a majority is also
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
a plurality
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
um has the Secretary of State's office
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
received a legal opinion to that effect
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
or is it just the legal Judgment of the
 
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.670 align:start position:0%
or is it just the legal Judgment of the
office

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
we are just stating that we believe
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
there may be a constitutional issue
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
uh because the Constitution was
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
specifically changed in 1912 to go from
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
a majority to a plurality we believe
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
that this is an issue that needs to be
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration in any bills
 
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
regarding runoffs we are not making we
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
are not stating a legal opinion we just
 
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
believe that there is a constitutional
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
issue follow-up
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
sorry just to confirm the Secretary of
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
State's office has not consulted with uh
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
with a with the attorney general or with
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
a law firm about this it's just the so
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's no legal analysis behind this is
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
that correct correct we believe that
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
there's our reading is that there may be
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
a constitutional issue we think this is
 
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:21.559 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature needs to
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
further further investigate we wanted to
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
bring up the issue
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
um I do have
 
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
um two questions I am it's further
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
disclosure I am a sponsor on this bill
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so if I step out of line I think
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative lingle give me uh well
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
let me know but I don't think I'm going
 
00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:40.549 align:start position:0%
let me know but I don't think I'm going
to

00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you raised in your testimony um you
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
didn't want Municipal elections to be
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
drowned out by state issues
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
um uh couldn't the same argument be made
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
of we hold our state elections and our
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
federal elections at the same time so we
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't want our state issues to be
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
oh that's a valid point but we are
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about the local elections they
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
just have a much smaller
 
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:07.930 align:start position:0%
just have a much smaller
um

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:07.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
geographic area that they are dealing
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
with and in a town who's trying if
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
you've ever been involved in an issue in
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
your town where you're trying to get
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
whether it's a new library I mean
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
several towns it takes some multiple
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
elections and to have that issue drowned
 
01:00:29.289 --> 01:00:29.299 align:start position:0%
out by
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
primaries for U.S Senate Congress we
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair for those local
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
local issues I'll save my debate for
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
that uh for the executive session
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to get in the back
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
and forth I do have one more
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
um this is just more of a point of
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
intrigue than necessarily the bill
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
it stems from the municipal and state
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
kind of vein representative Sweeney said
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
that our state law says that the First
 
01:00:59.569 --> 01:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
Nation primary will fall on the
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
municipal town meeting day
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
um if it's not if we're not a week in
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
front of everybody that's what he says
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
the default you said that the Municipal
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
elections are run by the municipality
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
and state and federal run by the state
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
so how would the Secretary of State's
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
office uh do that if if we did if for
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
some reason every other state decided to
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
stop jumping in front of us how would we
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
I would have to get back to you on that
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
we haven't had the uh primary the
 
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
presidential primary on
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
um town meeting day I think for a very
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I it was just a point of
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
curiosity it was this these are the
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
things I go through my mind in case
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
anybody's wondering uh any other
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you uh
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
senior Deputy a Lovejoy it's always a
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
pleasure uh next up is representative
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's some written testimony around
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
first which actually applies to both
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
bills but I I mostly talked about this
 
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could give it straight
 
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
steam the testimony is is theoretically
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's duplicative because I submitted it
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
through the submit testimony thing in
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
the website but I I'm at least in my
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
mind I'm totally unclear where it goes
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
or how anybody can actually see what's
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
submitted to it apparently some people
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
can see it but anyway so I'm resident
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan I'm continue to
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
represent Stratford County District 10
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
which is the uh town of Durham
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether uh
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
and in the previous testimony I did like
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
open the door I did open the door to
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
moving the primary forward a few weeks
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
but I still think it should be late
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
summer so I'm still like uh
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
I feel like maybe there's a bit of a
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
bait and switch going on here which is
 
01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:10.670 align:start position:0%
bait and switch going on here which is
like

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
myself and I'm speaking just for myself
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
probably some other Democrats say well
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to move to primary a
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
little early and then they're going to
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
like say we're going to compromise and
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
move it to June which at least for me
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
personally is not acceptable so I'm uh
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not as smart as I think I
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
am but I'm not planning to fall for that
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
particular baited switch if that's what
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
happens but anyway
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
um actual skip ahead
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
skip ahead to the last issue of my
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
written testimony which was uh
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
redistricting last year's very
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
districting year and the legislature
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
didn't complete the various
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
participating plans to a week before the
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
filing window and in fact the
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
Congressional plan was never really
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
completed with the the federal court had
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
to draw the lines for us um
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
and I don't see
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
if what HB well I don't even see how we
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
can meet the March filing window and
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
vision in HP 115 or this December one
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
which is presumably what this one
 
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
envisions although there's a drafting
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
errors I just
 
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
I just don't see how this process can
 
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
play out that quickly especially since
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
from what I as you shared with me
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
reminded me which I guess I heard at the
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
time Mr chair like we're chatting out in
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
the hallway
 
01:04:25.089 --> 01:04:25.099 align:start position:0%
um the Census Data was delayed in in
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
2020 2021 and that was one of the
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
reasons why the redistricting process
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
took longer
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
then maybe it took a long time in 2022
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
um we joined the district lines way back
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
in so the after the 2030 census we would
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
be joining the district lines in
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
December 2031 and I don't know how
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
realistic that is but that's uh although
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
I guess we have a decade to figure that
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
part of it is
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
um if we pass HB 333 with the March
 
01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.930 align:start position:0%
um if we pass HB 333 with the March
primary

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
um that would lengthen the post primary
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
phase of the campaign from roughly a
 
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
month and a half to almost eight months
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
are you raising your hand are you just
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
holding it up okay no I'm sorry I'm I'm
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
reading and this is how I oh thank you
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
oh no no problem you're doing a fine job
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
and better than me probably anyway so
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
place the nominees in the awkward I'm
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
not sure what a nominee is supposed to
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
do if you have eight months until the
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
general election like or do you either
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
board the elector to death burn out
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
their supporters and uh you know and
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
everything by knocking at door spitting
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
of signs mainly postcards running
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
against putting them signs all those
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
things we do during the primary for
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
basically three quarters of the year
 
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:35.579 align:start position:0%
um actually almost the entire year
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
including the primaries I um
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
one thing I like about the current
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
system it compresses uh both the primary
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
general elections into a few weeks
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
basically in the late summer and early
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
to mid-autumn even though the candidate
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
recruitment process starts in the spring
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
and you know we we're running a little
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
we are running
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
um in the early part of the summer too
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
but basically the whole thing is
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
compressed into like you know about
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh from basically from at least for a
 
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
State Rep candidates mostly can stuff
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
runs from like about August 1st to uh
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
election day in November which is
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
actually I think a good thing rather
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
than just stretching the whole thing out
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
over the entire year
 
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.049 align:start position:0%
over the entire year
um

01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
also that if we have a March primary
 
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
that guarantees the prime campaign is
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
going to hinge on issues which have
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
little or nothing to do with on the
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
voters months eight months later I think
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the name especially dramatic
 
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.049 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the name especially dramatic
example

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
the primary would have happened
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
basically before the pandemic and
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
everything that went along with it and
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
also uh also before the black to George
 
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
Floyd murder of the black lives matter
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh movement and so the issues are in
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
people's minds in November were probably
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
quite different from what they were you
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
know back in March um
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
and even and um and this would happen
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
even in 2022 I gave an example which
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
probably I'll skip over in order not to
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
start a riot but have a certain event
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
that was investigated this year and
 
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
I think some people's view we learned a
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
lot more about what happened in January
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
2021 than we did when this started that
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
may have changed some people's thinking
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that's about that's um so that's
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
that's basically it I think a long post
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
primary campaign is bad I think uh
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know having the primary campaign the
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
winners also I didn't go into that but
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
that's not really a great idea I think
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
it's better to have it in the summer
 
01:07:27.529 --> 01:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
especially for those of us who are in
 
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
the in the legislature
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
um because uh right now the current
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
primary move basically start the
 
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
re-election campaign right after the end
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
of the second year session and that's
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
perfect for us and anything else and
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
this would be we'd be running even
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
before the second year session starts
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
and that's bad
 
01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.309 align:start position:0%
and that's bad
um

01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:48.299 align:start position:0%
oh as for the runoffs although they're
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
sort of like backing off the sponsor to
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor just backed off from that
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
idea that doubles the cost of the
 
01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:56.579 align:start position:0%
election and also
 
01:07:56.579 --> 01:07:57.470 align:start position:0%
election and also
um

01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
and um also uh of course it's
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistent since there's lots of down
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
ticket races which are uh single seat
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
races I mean I see the lodge we're not
 
01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
trying to have a runoff for house race
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
how do you decide what the cutoff is you
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
know that's just
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
um but there are most of the down even
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
some of the State Rep races are single
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
member seats but the state senate and
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners except in my County
 
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
Stratford County where we we have a
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
three-person at-large district so that
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
the uh the runoff election that doubles
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
the cost of the election and I'm not
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
sure if it's a great idea and um I'm not
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
sure if any of this would also improve
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
the quality of a
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
the quality of uh The Challengers and
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
the primaries I know certainly I'll just
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
speak as a Democrats and we've Governor
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
cenuni has beaten us you know four times
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
in a row and um
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
especially this time he did it with the
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
candidate who I thought at least my
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
opinion was a very strong candidate ran
 
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
a very good race and uh you know he's
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
still got uh you know he still fell more
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
than a little short and I guess the
 
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
situation has been reversed the opposite
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
way for the Republicans and the down
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
ticket you know the Congressional and
 
01:09:07.249 --> 01:09:07.259 align:start position:0%
Senate races but I don't think
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
how this procedure helps helps that
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
problem you know that's probably just
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
um that's more sort of an internal
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
problem getting stronger candidates to
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
run but
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is true for the Governor's
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
candidates too but
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
so anyway I uh I mean retaining the bill
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
that uh sounds I mean that's obviously
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
an easy way out of it I would actually
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
probably prefer it yelling the whole
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
thing because I think this whole the
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
runoff election the early primaries I
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
just think those are fundamentally bad
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
ideas and you know the ranked Choice
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
voting can be considered on its own
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
merits but I don't think
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I think the Secretary of State's
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
office is right to be concerned about
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of it especially
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
if in this case we're doing some races
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
with the runoff to guarantee the
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
majority we're doing other races uh
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
other single-seat races
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
was the old traditional plurality of
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
things so that's really inconsistent so
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
um those are my that's why I'm against
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'd be happy to take any
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
Morgan is there any questions from the
 
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.110 align:start position:0%
Morgan is there any questions from the
committee

01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative uh
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
was there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 333 fiscal note
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no other questions uh
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
great news committee members we get to
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
have an early and long lunch I will be
 
01:10:28.209 --> 01:10:28.219 align:start position:0%
closing the hearing on
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
hb33fn we will be in recess until 1pm I
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
will ask the members of the Republican
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
caucus to hang back before you go over
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
and get your lunch so we can have a very
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
brief caucus
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll see you back at one
 
01:10:40.679 --> 01:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll see you back at one
o'clock

01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
could I also ask the Democrats to do the
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
same thing uh Ross where are you going
 
01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.050 align:start position:0%
same thing uh Ross where are you going
okay

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:05:45.110 --> 03:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
all right welcome and we are going to
 
03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:01.490 --> 03:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and honorable members
 
03:06:02.990 --> 03:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
03:06:05.389 --> 03:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed I represent Newmarket and
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
new Fields
 
03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:07.790 align:start position:0%
new Fields
um

03:06:07.790 --> 03:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:11.570 --> 03:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
and I just as a like a preface to these
 
03:06:13.370 --> 03:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
next two hearings
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
um so those of you who've been on the
 
03:06:18.889 --> 03:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
committee before are familiar with RCV
 
03:06:20.809 --> 03:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
hearings going pretty long two to three
 
03:06:24.050 --> 03:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
hours also last year we had the big Bill
 
03:06:26.570 --> 03:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
first what we call the big Bill where we
 
03:06:29.150 --> 03:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
go into great depth on on a lot of
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
issues and then we had the enabling
 
03:06:33.650 --> 03:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
build this year it's reversed so we're
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to try to honor the committee's
 
03:06:38.809 --> 03:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
time as best as possible so there will
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
be some issues that we touch on in the
 
03:06:45.290 --> 03:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
this enabling bill now that we might get
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions to go in depth and the the
 
03:06:48.889 --> 03:06:48.899 align:start position:0%
details aren't necessarily pertinent for
 
03:06:50.210 --> 03:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
the enabling bill but they are for the
 
03:06:52.370 --> 03:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
big bill so we'll probably say can we
 
03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
please just address that in the next
 
03:06:53.880 --> 03:06:55.190 align:start position:0%
please just address that in the next
hearing

03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:06:58.670 --> 03:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
um if you all would honor that I also
 
03:07:00.889 --> 03:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
have asked because in order to honor the
 
03:07:02.769 --> 03:07:02.779 align:start position:0%
committee's time ask that
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
I have not asked people to come and
 
03:07:08.330 --> 03:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
testify those who have come to side that
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted to testify I've asked them
 
03:07:11.809 --> 03:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
to be very brief we're focusing just on
 
03:07:14.090 --> 03:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
a couple of experts to really I think
 
03:07:15.230 --> 03:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
those of you who've been here before
 
03:07:17.090 --> 03:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
know that we can fill this room with
 
03:07:18.769 --> 03:07:18.779 align:start position:0%
with supporters that's not the question
 
03:07:21.349 --> 03:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not our CV's popular is a
 
03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
concept but really to do an educational
 
03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
Deep dive into the issues having said
 
03:07:31.130 --> 03:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
that HB 345 is before you this is an
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
enabling only Bill it does nothing in
 
03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
and of itself other than untie the hands
 
03:07:41.150 --> 03:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
of parties and municipalities
 
03:07:44.090 --> 03:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
um for Municipal elections for
 
03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities it would only be for
 
03:07:48.050 --> 03:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
their Municipal elections you cannot do
 
03:07:49.610 --> 03:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
other elections
 
03:07:51.950 --> 03:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
um with one town doing RCV another one's
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
not so it'd only be for the Municipal
 
03:07:55.969 --> 03:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
elections every town and every party
 
03:07:58.190 --> 03:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
would get to opt in through their own
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
internal procedures for municipalities
 
03:08:02.690 --> 03:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
that means a vote of the town's people
 
03:08:04.269 --> 03:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
through their normal
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
likely warrant process whatever process
 
03:08:10.370 --> 03:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
that that town or city has currently it
 
03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
would be through the normal process
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
as you're aware we're Dylan's rule state
 
03:08:17.389 --> 03:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
which means towns cannot currently do
 
03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
this until we enable them so that is why
 
03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
this is necessary for towns that want to
 
03:08:24.769 --> 03:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
have ranked Choice voting for their
 
03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections and there is a very
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
very good reason why towns would want
 
03:08:31.150 --> 03:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
that which I will touch on in a moment
 
03:08:35.870 --> 03:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
four parties the party would opt in
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
through their own internal procedure as
 
03:08:40.750 --> 03:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
normal how they do every other decision
 
03:08:43.490 --> 03:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
both for municipalities and parties they
 
03:08:45.170 --> 03:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
would notify the Secretary of State 90
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
days in advance at least 90 days in
 
03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:48.370 align:start position:0%
days in advance at least 90 days in
advance

03:08:48.370 --> 03:08:48.380 align:start position:0%
advance
 
03:08:51.410 --> 03:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
any party or municipality May opt in
 
03:08:53.450 --> 03:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
independently to any other party or
 
03:08:55.309 --> 03:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
municipality and they can also opt out
 
03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
at any time so there's no onerous
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
anything nothing binding this only
 
03:09:05.210 --> 03:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
inside their hands and they liberates
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
them to do just what they want
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
um it also allows both municipalities
 
03:09:14.650 --> 03:09:14.660 align:start position:0%
and probably more importantly parties to
 
03:09:17.150 --> 03:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
specify which Races they would like to
 
03:09:19.130 --> 03:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
enable ranked Choice voting for which
 
03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
again I think especially for parties
 
03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
will be very important before I get into
 
03:09:27.230 --> 03:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
more detail because and I don't want to
 
03:09:30.230 --> 03:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
get into too much detail on the concept
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
of ranked Choice voting because we do
 
03:09:33.710 --> 03:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
have the big Bill next but I feel like
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
there's so many new members of this
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee this year that I should
 
03:09:39.469 --> 03:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
probably just do a very brief
 
03:09:43.309 --> 03:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
um overview of why it's good what
 
03:09:45.969 --> 03:09:45.979 align:start position:0%
problem is it solving and how it's done
 
03:09:49.550 --> 03:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
so the way we currently vote is referred
 
03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
to as first pass the post it comes from
 
03:09:55.250 --> 03:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know Antiquity really Mary old
 
03:09:57.530 --> 03:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
England uh when they didn't really have
 
03:10:00.050 --> 03:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated ways of
 
03:10:02.330 --> 03:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
um voting now the problem with first
 
03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
pass the poster one of the biggest
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
problems is that it's fine if you have a
 
03:10:09.050 --> 03:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
single winner election so one seat up
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
for grabs and two people running it
 
03:10:14.090 --> 03:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
works great because whoever wins is
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to have 50 or more of the
 
03:10:18.830 --> 03:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
vote and therefore a mandate from the
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
voters but if you have more than two
 
03:10:23.690 --> 03:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
people running for that seat you may end
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
up with a winner that has what we call a
 
03:10:28.969 --> 03:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
low plurality uh low plurality vote low
 
03:10:31.490 --> 03:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
plurality winner and what that means is
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's possible for the other two
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
supporters of the other two candidates
 
03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
to have combined and preferred one of
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
the other two to the person who won and
 
03:10:43.610 --> 03:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
this ends up with a lot of division
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
because if someone wins with 37 percent
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the vote but the supporters of the
 
03:10:49.730 --> 03:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
other two candidates feel strongly that
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
they're against them they feel like that
 
03:10:54.349 --> 03:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
is an illegitimate election and I think
 
03:10:57.230 --> 03:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
that we've all heard a lot of
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
um saddening stories about how bitterly
 
03:11:01.849 --> 03:11:01.859 align:start position:0%
divided and polarized our society has
 
03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
become because people feel like
 
03:11:06.110 --> 03:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
different elections are illegitimate
 
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
and I would say that on both sides
 
03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:09.950 align:start position:0%
and I would say that on both sides
actually

03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
um so I want to Define very very quickly
 
03:11:14.269 --> 03:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
plurality and majority because it will
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
come up and you'll especially come up in
 
03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
the next bill I don't want to go into
 
03:11:19.370 --> 03:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
detail for those of you new I presume
 
03:11:20.929 --> 03:11:20.939 align:start position:0%
most people know this plurality simply
 
03:11:23.450 --> 03:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
means the most number of votes majority
 
03:11:26.150 --> 03:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
is 50 plus one
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
the majority is a type of plurality so
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
all majorities are pluralities not all
 
03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
pluralities are majorities majorities
 
03:11:35.929 --> 03:11:35.939 align:start position:0%
are a better type of plurality I will
 
03:11:38.450 --> 03:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
say this much ranked Choice voting does
 
03:11:40.670 --> 03:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
not require a majority to win in fact
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of times that you don't
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
have a majority when you have a ranked
 
03:11:45.769 --> 03:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
Choice voting winner but we'll get more
 
03:11:48.769 --> 03:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
into that probably in the next spill
 
03:11:52.250 --> 03:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
um so again the this was known the idea
 
03:11:53.929 --> 03:11:53.939 align:start position:0%
of a low plurality winner was a known
 
03:11:57.469 --> 03:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
issue even back in the day and so a lot
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
of places including New Hampshire and a
 
03:12:01.730 --> 03:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
lot of other states started to Institute
 
03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
a majority rule we actually had in our
 
03:12:06.290 --> 03:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
constitution from the beginning a
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that winners for certain
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
races have a majority because we wanted
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
to not have those low plurality winners
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what started happening
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
political games we're all familiar with
 
03:12:20.210 --> 03:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
that parties were starting to realize
 
03:12:22.490 --> 03:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
that if they ran someone who could split
 
03:12:25.130 --> 03:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
the other Party's candidate then there
 
03:12:27.170 --> 03:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
would be no majority in what we had in
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
the constitution is if there was no
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
majority the legislature would decide
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so increasingly so late 1800s and
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
1900s legislative races were being
 
03:12:40.190 --> 03:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
decided by the legislature and what was
 
03:12:42.170 --> 03:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
seen as very very political decisions
 
03:12:44.450 --> 03:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
and so around that time we amended the
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution to say it just requires a
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
plurality but we're back to the low
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.370 --> 03:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
with this as I've already said is it
 
03:12:57.769 --> 03:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
decreases voter confidence it increases
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
voter apathy decreases turnout and just
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
in general is seen as uh not as valid a
 
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
system people don't feel like their
 
03:13:08.809 --> 03:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
votes matter and indeed there are
 
03:13:11.210 --> 03:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
elections where votes don't matter if
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
you are one party in a district that's
 
03:13:14.929 --> 03:13:14.939 align:start position:0%
majority of the other party very
 
03:13:16.370 --> 03:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
frequently your vote really doesn't
 
03:13:18.170 --> 03:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
Mount to too much
 
03:13:20.510 --> 03:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I think the goal we can all agree is
 
03:13:22.849 --> 03:13:22.859 align:start position:0%
to have every vote count equally one
 
03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
person one vote
 
03:13:25.020 --> 03:13:28.490 align:start position:0%
person one vote
foreign

03:13:28.490 --> 03:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
the other option you have and some towns
 
03:13:33.769 --> 03:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
do this which is why towns will want the
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
ability to enable ranked Choice voting
 
03:13:38.210 --> 03:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
and many states do this as well is
 
03:13:40.490 --> 03:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
runoff elections in a runoff election
 
03:13:43.490 --> 03:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
yes you're probably familiar
 
03:13:46.010 --> 03:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
um if there's no one that has a majority
 
03:13:48.110 --> 03:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
all of the candidates except the top two
 
03:13:50.210 --> 03:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
are eliminated and you have a whole new
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
election you wait a month or two turn
 
03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
everybody back out it's millions of
 
03:13:57.230 --> 03:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
dollars so run off elections while
 
03:13:58.730 --> 03:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
they're better than low plurality
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
winners they are extremely expensive
 
03:14:04.969 --> 03:14:04.979 align:start position:0%
um It suffers greatly from A reduced
 
03:14:07.130 --> 03:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
turnout people kind of get hyped for the
 
03:14:09.050 --> 03:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
general and then for One race don't
 
03:14:12.050 --> 03:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
typically turn out in the same numbers
 
03:14:14.690 --> 03:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
um also the procedure for runoff is
 
03:14:17.929 --> 03:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
inferior to ranked Choice voting because
 
03:14:20.030 --> 03:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating all of the candidates
 
03:14:22.730 --> 03:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
now it's very very possible if you had a
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
slate of say six or seven candidates
 
03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
that three or four of those candidates
 
03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
supporters would coalesce around one but
 
03:14:30.769 --> 03:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
because all of those candidates got
 
03:14:33.650 --> 03:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
eliminated the voters are then forced
 
03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
into one of the top two
 
03:14:39.170 --> 03:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
so that's another way in which uh it's
 
03:14:39.180 --> 03:14:40.969 align:start position:0%
so that's another way in which uh it's
problematic

03:14:40.969 --> 03:14:40.979 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
03:14:45.230 --> 03:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
so uh of the different systems that are
 
03:14:48.349 --> 03:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
available ranked Choice voting has the
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
highest definition picture of the will
 
03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the electorate it has the capacity to
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
not just capture who people want but the
 
03:14:57.889 --> 03:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
level at which they want those
 
03:15:00.590 --> 03:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
candidates and their ability to say
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
anyone but that guy right which is
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
something that our current system
 
03:15:08.809 --> 03:15:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.450 --> 03:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
um so very very quickly and we can go
 
03:15:12.650 --> 03:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
into more depth with questions
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
especially on the next bill
 
03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
um so ranked Choice voting simply if you
 
03:15:19.130 --> 03:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
can rank your favorite flavors of ice
 
03:15:21.070 --> 03:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
cream you can rank your favorite
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
politicians uh and you rank them and
 
03:15:26.809 --> 03:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
then they go through runoffs so we take
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's first preference
 
03:15:32.030 --> 03:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
if nobody has uh reached the threshold
 
03:15:34.490 --> 03:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
for winning which in a single member
 
03:15:39.170 --> 03:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
district is 50 plus one then you
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate the least vote getter and
 
03:15:44.030 --> 03:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
those ballots go get counted towards
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
those people's next preference very very
 
03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
similar to a runoff election repeat
 
03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:49.429 align:start position:0%
similar to a runoff election repeat
balloting

03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
balloting
 
03:15:52.730 --> 03:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
that threshold for the single member is
 
03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
50 plus one in multi-member districts
 
03:15:56.929 --> 03:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
that threshold is different and the
 
03:15:59.690 --> 03:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
formula is one over the number of seats
 
03:16:02.690 --> 03:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
available plus one so that's one of the
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
reasons that not every election results
 
03:16:07.429 --> 03:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
in a majority uh winner
 
03:16:09.769 --> 03:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
so benefits of ranked Choice voting to
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
get back into
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
um Less in the theory and back into this
 
03:16:17.809 --> 03:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
bill so on the town level enabling towns
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
especially runoff towns who can then
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
save quite a bit of money in not having
 
03:16:25.130 --> 03:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
to do a runoff election which I already
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned not only is expensive not only
 
03:16:29.690 --> 03:16:29.700 align:start position:0%
suffers from low turnout not only has an
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
inferior way of of eliminating
 
03:16:34.730 --> 03:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
candidates but also has the problem of
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
extending the campaign season which
 
03:16:38.510 --> 03:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
people already feel is super divisive I
 
03:16:39.650 --> 03:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've ever talked to your
 
03:16:41.690 --> 03:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
constituents but people hate campaign
 
03:16:43.490 --> 03:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
signs they hate campaign season in
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
general and there's actually been
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
National moves to movements to shorten
 
03:16:50.210 --> 03:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
campaign season not lengthen it so and
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
not only does it extend the campaign
 
03:16:53.929 --> 03:16:53.939 align:start position:0%
season but then you also have the
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
problem of the empty seat in the
 
03:16:57.530 --> 03:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
legislature which we're familiar with
 
03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
now we're familiar with on the national
 
03:17:01.610 --> 03:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
level as well when you have a runoff
 
03:17:03.250 --> 03:17:03.260 align:start position:0%
election you have that empty seat
 
03:17:05.870 --> 03:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
allowing towns to solve all of those
 
03:17:07.130 --> 03:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
problems by enabling ranked Choice
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
voting if they so choose specifically if
 
03:17:12.889 --> 03:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
the voters of that town so choose allows
 
03:17:15.170 --> 03:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
us to use those towns as Laboratories of
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
democracy that wonderful Federalist
 
03:17:24.349 --> 03:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
covered all the runoff things primaries
 
03:17:30.290 --> 03:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
so for primaries I'll speak of primaries
 
03:17:31.550 --> 03:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
broadly and then I want to get into the
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
presidential primary which is kind of
 
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
the really juicy stuff uh primaries
 
03:17:38.990 --> 03:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
as we have seen in recent both
 
03:17:40.490 --> 03:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
Congressional and presidential primaries
 
03:17:44.210 --> 03:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
in this state frequently have uh slates
 
03:17:47.870 --> 03:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
of 15 even upwards of 30 candidates and
 
03:17:49.610 --> 03:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
this is when ranked Choice voting really
 
03:17:52.490 --> 03:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
really shines when you have these many
 
03:17:55.490 --> 03:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
candidates you have the ability
 
03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
um in the first pass the post system of
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
having a winner that has 18 19 of the
 
03:18:04.610 --> 03:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
vote clearly not a mandate clearly and
 
03:18:06.710 --> 03:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
very easily Could Be Imagined is not
 
03:18:08.570 --> 03:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
really supported by a majority of the
 
03:18:08.580 --> 03:18:10.309 align:start position:0%
really supported by a majority of the
people

03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:18:12.530 --> 03:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
um ranked Choice voting really is
 
03:18:15.530 --> 03:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
necessary in situations where you have
 
03:18:19.070 --> 03:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
that many candidates and I'll get to in
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
the next bill um exactly why because we
 
03:18:23.389 --> 03:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
have international examples of how bad
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
things can get when you have that many
 
03:18:24.720 --> 03:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
things can get when you have that many
candidates

03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
03:18:29.090 --> 03:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
um primaries in general are super
 
03:18:30.769 --> 03:18:30.779 align:start position:0%
important for our democracy they're an
 
03:18:34.610 --> 03:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
integral part of how we elect people I
 
03:18:37.690 --> 03:18:37.700 align:start position:0%
know we they are in fact private entity
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh events however we fund them on a
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
state level because they're so integral
 
03:18:45.650 --> 03:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
to our democracy to our representative
 
03:18:48.050 --> 03:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
democracy Boss Tweed is famous for
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
saying I don't care who gets to vote so
 
03:18:51.889 --> 03:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
long as I get to pick the candidates
 
03:18:54.230 --> 03:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's why that's why primaries are so
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
very important so having more accurate
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
representation on the primary level is
 
03:19:01.610 --> 03:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
super important
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting also eliminates the
 
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
need for strategic voting and this is
 
03:19:08.929 --> 03:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
really I mean again the big Bill we can
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
go into more details but the idea that
 
03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
you're forced between the the lesser of
 
03:19:15.889 --> 03:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
two evils that you don't really get to
 
03:19:17.929 --> 03:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
vote your conscience you'd really prefer
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
this guy but in a first pass the post
 
03:19:21.769 --> 03:19:21.779 align:start position:0%
system there's only two candidates that
 
03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
ever matter and first pass the post
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's the the person in the lead and
 
03:19:27.290 --> 03:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
the person closest to kicking out the
 
03:19:28.670 --> 03:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
person in the lead
 
03:19:30.170 --> 03:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
those are the only two candidates that
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
matter we consider in electoral Theory
 
03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
any vote cast for anyone other than
 
03:19:39.469 --> 03:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
those two people a wasted vote because
 
03:19:42.230 --> 03:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't actually help one of the two
 
03:19:44.809 --> 03:19:44.819 align:start position:0%
Front Runners
 
03:19:44.819 --> 03:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
Front Runners
okay

03:19:45.830 --> 03:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:19:48.290 --> 03:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
now it eliminates that strategic voting
 
03:19:50.090 --> 03:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
you liberates you to vote your
 
03:19:52.190 --> 03:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
conscience which I think is kind of what
 
03:19:53.690 --> 03:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
we all were taught like in third grade
 
03:19:55.130 --> 03:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
how our democracy is supposed to work
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
you really vote for the person you like
 
03:19:56.760 --> 03:19:57.950 align:start position:0%
you really vote for the person you like
best

03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
best
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
because it never ever hurts you to rank
 
03:20:03.050 --> 03:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
people after your first preference your
 
03:20:04.790 --> 03:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
ballot never counts towards anybody
 
03:20:06.530 --> 03:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
other than your first preference unless
 
03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
your first preference gets eliminated so
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're completely liberated to vote as
 
03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
your conscience dictates
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
it also decreases negativity in
 
03:20:19.630 --> 03:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
campaigns and increases in the case of
 
03:20:21.769 --> 03:20:21.779 align:start position:0%
specifically primaries as we're talking
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
about enabling party Unity
 
03:20:27.170 --> 03:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
um it does increase turnout candidates
 
03:20:29.690 --> 03:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
tend to not bad-mouth each other if
 
03:20:31.790 --> 03:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get the supporters of
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
another candidate to choose them as
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
their second or third preference right
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
so it tends to decrease the the negative
 
03:20:41.090 --> 03:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
campaigning people aren't as turned off
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
they do feel like their votes matter
 
03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
because they get more of a voice on
 
03:20:47.150 --> 03:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
their ballot and people turn out more
 
03:20:49.790 --> 03:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
but specifically in presidential
 
03:20:52.610 --> 03:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
primaries it really has the the power to
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
bring parties together much much sooner
 
03:20:56.809 --> 03:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
we're used to hearing news about how
 
03:20:58.250 --> 03:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
divided a party gets during a
 
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and how quickly the
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
party wants to try to gather the party
 
03:21:04.510 --> 03:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
Unity back together
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
in presidential primaries and I presume
 
03:21:10.250 --> 03:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
all of you are aware
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
you're not actually like voting you're
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
voting for someone to get delegates in a
 
03:21:16.250 --> 03:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
convention right it's not the the
 
03:21:19.010 --> 03:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
typical way of voting and so there's a
 
03:21:21.290 --> 03:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
threshold so there's not a one winner
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
there's a threshold for getting those
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
delegates in the Republican party it's
 
03:21:28.670 --> 03:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
10 and the Democratic party it's 15 and
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
what that means and I can refer you to
 
03:21:36.230 --> 03:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
um the sheet that looks like this
 
03:21:39.170 --> 03:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
this top left chart
 
03:21:41.570 --> 03:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
shows the dash blue line is the
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
Democratic threshold of 15 the dashed
 
03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
red line is the Republican threshold of
 
03:21:49.370 --> 03:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
10 and you can kind of read it however
 
03:21:51.170 --> 03:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
whichever party you would like to read
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
it for based on that line but just
 
03:21:55.849 --> 03:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
reading it for only the Democratic party
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
in this example only Apple gets
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
delegates at all even though
 
03:22:04.969 --> 03:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
nearly 85 percent of the voters wanted
 
03:22:06.550 --> 03:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
someone else meaning the party
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
effectively throws out 85 percent of all
 
03:22:11.389 --> 03:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
ballots cast in that presidential
 
03:22:11.399 --> 03:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
ballots cast in that presidential
primary

03:22:13.070 --> 03:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
primary
 
03:22:14.809 --> 03:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
I don't think 85 percent of people
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
voting in a presidential primary went
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:23.570 --> 03:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and you know there's been plenty of
 
03:22:27.050 --> 03:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
talk about the lack of democratic
 
03:22:27.060 --> 03:22:27.769 align:start position:0%
talk about the lack of democratic
um

03:22:27.769 --> 03:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:30.290 --> 03:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
principles in in Party primary
 
03:22:33.110 --> 03:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
presidential primary systems if you look
 
03:22:34.910 --> 03:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
down at
 
03:22:36.769 --> 03:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
um in this sheet is specifically for
 
03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
first uh in the nation primary results
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
which I'll get to I looked on the the
 
03:22:42.530 --> 03:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting results in a
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
primary you're no longer just
 
03:22:48.170 --> 03:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
eliminating until someone gets wins like
 
03:22:49.550 --> 03:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
in a normal election you're eliminating
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
until people everybody left is over the
 
03:22:53.570 --> 03:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
threshold whether it's 10 or 15 percent
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
and here you get much much clearer
 
03:22:56.340 --> 03:22:57.410 align:start position:0%
and here you get much much clearer
results

03:22:57.410 --> 03:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
here you can see that there's a few
 
03:23:01.690 --> 03:23:01.700 align:start position:0%
Front Runners that have a lot of support
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not they had supported other
 
03:23:06.290 --> 03:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
candidates first you don't get a whole
 
03:23:07.849 --> 03:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
bunch of candidates like you do in the
 
03:23:09.950 --> 03:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
first graph that all have like eight
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
percent nine percent seven percent you
 
03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
get a few strong clear Front Runners
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
which is the kind of information by the
 
03:23:19.849 --> 03:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
way you want in a first in the nation
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
primary or an early primary at all you
 
03:23:25.130 --> 03:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
don't want static you want clear Salient
 
03:23:27.590 --> 03:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
actionable information and not just for
 
03:23:28.809 --> 03:23:28.819 align:start position:0%
the rest of the voters of the country
 
03:23:32.330 --> 03:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
you also want it for the candidates and
 
03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
this is where we get back to party Unity
 
03:23:38.030 --> 03:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
candidates in a presidential primary are
 
03:23:40.190 --> 03:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
always looking to see whether or not
 
03:23:43.250 --> 03:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
they should drop and win if they can see
 
03:23:46.370 --> 03:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
that their supporters actually they can
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
get some of peers supporters over if
 
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
Peer gets eliminated they can get some
 
03:23:52.250 --> 03:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
orange supporters if orange gets
 
03:23:54.050 --> 03:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
eliminated then they know they can stay
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
in if they see that they're actually
 
03:23:59.090 --> 03:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
none of the other candidates actually
 
03:24:00.769 --> 03:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
have supporters that support them they
 
03:24:03.050 --> 03:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
can drop and they can drop sooner
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
dropping sooner not only helps party
 
03:24:08.570 --> 03:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
Unity much much quicker but it helps
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
later States and if later states have
 
03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting what it means is
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
that those later States primaries their
 
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
voters who now currently potentially
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
waste their votes when they vote on for
 
03:24:22.190 --> 03:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
a candidate that has already dropped but
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
dropped too late and so their name is
 
03:24:26.090 --> 03:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
still on the ballot
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
or people who have absentee voted or
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
early voted and they voted for a
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
candidate who dropped again late having
 
03:24:36.410 --> 03:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
them drop sooner again produces better
 
03:24:38.690 --> 03:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
results so having firsts in the nation
 
03:24:41.929 --> 03:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
as ranked Choice voting or an early uh
 
03:24:44.210 --> 03:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
primary is ranked Choice voting helps
 
03:24:46.729 --> 03:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
other states and other voters in other
 
03:24:50.330 --> 03:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
states have their votes count
 
03:24:53.150 --> 03:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
so representative Reed we are at the
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
20-minute Mark which is unprecedented so
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'd ask you to wrap it please we've got
 
03:25:00.290 --> 03:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of people after you
 
03:25:00.300 --> 03:25:01.790 align:start position:0%
a lot of people after you
foreign

03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to move on to uh
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
implementation so for primary
 
03:25:14.210 --> 03:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
implementation again it's only if the
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
party opts in the counting is done by
 
03:25:18.229 --> 03:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State there's
 
03:25:20.929 --> 03:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
absolutely no change for any of the
 
03:25:23.809 --> 03:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
workers on the town level so I know
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
we've heard in years past oh my gosh
 
03:25:26.929 --> 03:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
will towns be able they don't have to
 
03:25:28.729 --> 03:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
know how to do it they just have to you
 
03:25:31.250 --> 03:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
know and we do have education
 
03:25:33.050 --> 03:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
um every state and everywhere that's
 
03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
implemented this which is very very
 
03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
numerous there are organizations they're
 
03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
willing to do the education but the
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
actual work for the town workers on the
 
03:25:42.290 --> 03:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
town level doesn't change at all they do
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
not have to do any of the counting
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
results so what we think of as results
 
03:25:49.130 --> 03:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
and we talk about
 
03:25:51.170 --> 03:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
um like certified results or official
 
03:25:52.490 --> 03:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
results from the Secretary of State's
 
03:25:55.130 --> 03:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
office but that night's results are
 
03:25:57.290 --> 03:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
preliminary and what we think of those
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
as results are really what the Press is
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
reporting that doesn't change towns can
 
03:26:03.889 --> 03:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
still report their first round numbers
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
as always and it gets in the press the
 
03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
same speed as it currently does
 
03:26:11.929 --> 03:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the actual implementation
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
there's a few different options but even
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
the slowest of the options still
 
03:26:19.849 --> 03:26:19.859 align:start position:0%
produces results within hours
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
in Maine Maine specifically gives their
 
03:26:25.969 --> 03:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
towns a week to return information from
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
their election the actually counting the
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
actual counting process in Maine is
 
03:26:31.969 --> 03:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
extremely fast but they don't get the
 
03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
results from the towns for a week we
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
require talents to submit information
 
03:26:40.030 --> 03:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
that night and so the actual process
 
03:26:42.969 --> 03:26:42.979 align:start position:0%
would happen within a few hours
 
03:26:46.190 --> 03:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
one of and if we stay with our current
 
03:26:48.650 --> 03:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
machines which is eventually unlikely
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
because our machines and has been
 
03:26:52.610 --> 03:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
reported and talked about extensively
 
03:26:54.790 --> 03:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
are in desperate need of updating anyway
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
but if we stay with our current machines
 
03:26:59.510 --> 03:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
all the ballots would be couriered to
 
03:27:01.010 --> 03:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
central location for the Secretary of
 
03:27:03.050 --> 03:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
State's office they rent high-speed
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
scanners they use open source software
 
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it that's it it's very simple now we
 
03:27:12.410 --> 03:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
already Courier things from towns on
 
03:27:14.330 --> 03:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
Election night anyway
 
03:27:17.150 --> 03:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
this is by and large how Maine does
 
03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
theirs Maine also has towns that have
 
03:27:23.210 --> 03:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
machines that produce the data so we
 
03:27:24.410 --> 03:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
didn't wouldn't have to move the actual
 
03:27:26.330 --> 03:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
ballots we could just move flash cards
 
03:27:28.429 --> 03:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
so whether or not you have an updated
 
03:27:30.530 --> 03:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
machine doesn't mean you can't do it it
 
03:27:31.929 --> 03:27:31.939 align:start position:0%
just is the difference between
 
03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
couriering a box of ballots or occurring
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
something that big
 
03:27:41.090 --> 03:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
now as I said we are in I know the
 
03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office has been
 
03:27:45.170 --> 03:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
looking at new machines and is in the
 
03:27:47.349 --> 03:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
process of certifying new machines
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
that may come quickly or not so quickly
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
we do have excess have a funds we have a
 
03:27:56.389 --> 03:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
mandate that we have to fund our
 
03:27:58.130 --> 03:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
elections 10 years out so how much half
 
03:27:59.750 --> 03:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
of funds we have available for new
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
machines is in question however I'm
 
03:28:03.530 --> 03:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the Secretary of
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
State's office and putting in uh
 
03:28:07.490 --> 03:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
legislation or working with the Senate
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill to uh to make sure
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hava funds are available for new
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
machines if that's the route that the
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would like to go in
 
03:28:18.889 --> 03:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
implementation either way it's
 
03:28:21.889 --> 03:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
completely implementable Maine like I
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
said has done this exact process we
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
already Courier they Courier in Maine
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
they implemented this for twenty nine
 
03:28:32.990 --> 03:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars up front and then each
 
03:28:37.610 --> 03:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
election is about 79 000 so very very
 
03:28:37.620 --> 03:28:39.229 align:start position:0%
election is about 79 000 so very very
affordable

03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
03:28:41.929 --> 03:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
Mr representative that was another three
 
03:28:43.309 --> 03:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
minutes which is awesome people have
 
03:28:45.229 --> 03:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
asked for and gone through about half
 
03:28:46.910 --> 03:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
the a lot of time for the hearing so
 
03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
please wrap it up respect for the other
 
03:28:51.650 --> 03:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
folks behind you okay I I do have
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
respect for the folks behind me
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
um I will do the best I can Mr chair but
 
03:29:00.889 --> 03:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
it is a a big deal bill that requires a
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
lot of introduction
 
03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
well you have one minute remaining
 
03:29:08.349 --> 03:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh voter experience and voter everywhere
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
that this is implemented voters exit
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
polls show that voters understand and
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
understand how it's counted we're
 
03:29:19.690 --> 03:29:19.700 align:start position:0%
talking about 70s 80s and 90
 
03:29:22.370 --> 03:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
they like the process they understand it
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
and they they think their vote counts
 
03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
more in terms of arguments the biggest
 
03:29:30.590 --> 03:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
arguments I usually hear are well it
 
03:29:32.210 --> 03:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
happened in this location and my guy
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
didn't win that is never a good reason
 
03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
to pick an election system you should
 
03:29:37.969 --> 03:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
pick an election system based on the
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
fairness I will say that it's pretty
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
public that I have been a long time
 
03:29:44.690 --> 03:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
Bernie supporter in this last primary if
 
03:29:46.729 --> 03:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
we had used ranked Choice voting he
 
03:29:49.070 --> 03:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
probably would not one have won New
 
03:29:51.530 --> 03:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and yet I still support it I
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
will refer you also to the chocolate
 
03:29:56.750 --> 03:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
election where from last year on this
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
handout where the original winner was
 
03:30:03.070 --> 03:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
Almond Joy which I also preferred but
 
03:30:06.050 --> 03:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
uh did not end up becoming the the final
 
03:30:06.060 --> 03:30:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh did not end up becoming the the final
winner

03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
winner
 
03:30:09.410 --> 03:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
we should pick election systems based on
 
03:30:09.420 --> 03:30:10.729 align:start position:0%
we should pick election systems based on
fairness

03:30:10.729 --> 03:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh finally the idea that it's newfangled
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
and difficult and hard to understand 27
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
States on some level have used this sum
 
03:30:23.450 --> 03:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
since 1912. Australia and about a dozen
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
other countries have used it on the
 
03:30:27.410 --> 03:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
national level for over a hundred years
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the case of Australia
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
um it's used throughout the
 
03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
English-speaking world it's used for
 
03:30:33.889 --> 03:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of organizations
 
03:30:36.410 --> 03:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
including the Academy Awards including
 
03:30:36.420 --> 03:30:38.330 align:start position:0%
including the Academy Awards including
Mensa

03:30:38.330 --> 03:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
Mensa
 
03:30:38.340 --> 03:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
Mensa
um

03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:41.210 --> 03:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
there's no issue you can come up with
 
03:30:42.889 --> 03:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
that hasn't already been addressed by
 
03:30:44.330 --> 03:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
these entities
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
paper ballots 100 can be hand counted
 
03:30:49.370 --> 03:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's been hand counted since
 
03:30:51.650 --> 03:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
before we had machines to count
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
um can it be verified Can it can you do
 
03:30:56.090 --> 03:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
a recount 100 easily done I've done it
 
03:30:58.670 --> 03:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
in public several times four people to
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
watch the process so all of those
 
03:31:04.190 --> 03:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
arguments absolutely are based on a lack
 
03:31:06.650 --> 03:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
of understanding of uh ranked Choice
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
voting and I will end by saying anytime
 
03:31:11.809 --> 03:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
you have Ben Shapiro and Bernie Sanders
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
agreeing on something as they do with
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting it's probably a
 
03:31:17.690 --> 03:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
good idea to look into it with an open
 
03:31:20.210 --> 03:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
open heart and open mind thank you Mr
 
03:31:20.220 --> 03:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
open heart and open mind thank you Mr

03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%

03:31:22.490 --> 03:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:31:24.650 --> 03:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you we're going to forego
 
03:31:26.330 --> 03:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
questions right now
 
03:31:46.729 --> 03:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Smith and
 
03:31:52.190 --> 03:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
members of the election law committee my
 
03:31:54.889 --> 03:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
name is Linda Bundy I'm from Antrim
 
03:31:58.490 --> 03:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
I support HB 345 enabling ranked Choice
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
voting for State primaries and Municipal
 
03:32:05.090 --> 03:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
elections in ranked Choice voting voters
 
03:32:06.889 --> 03:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
rank candidates based on their
 
03:32:09.530 --> 03:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
individual preferences giving them more
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
choice because winning requires a
 
03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
majority of the votes elections result
 
03:32:19.250 --> 03:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
and candidates supported by more voters
 
03:32:21.290 --> 03:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting increases
 
03:32:23.929 --> 03:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
competition and candidate interaction
 
03:32:26.570 --> 03:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
with voters because they must work to
 
03:32:28.849 --> 03:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
earn the support from a broader range of
 
03:32:28.859 --> 03:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
earn the support from a broader range of
Voters

03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
Voters
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting Works equally well
 
03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
when there are multiple seats to fill
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
elections for municipal offices school
 
03:32:41.450 --> 03:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
boards floaterial districts and
 
03:32:43.729 --> 03:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts are ideally
 
03:32:46.250 --> 03:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
suited for ranked choice
 
03:32:48.590 --> 03:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
this bill presents an excellent way to
 
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
begin using ranked choice in New
 
03:32:50.760 --> 03:32:51.769 align:start position:0%
begin using ranked choice in New
Hampshire

03:32:51.769 --> 03:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:32:55.070 --> 03:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
it allows parties and municipalities the
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opt in to this method and
 
03:33:01.010 --> 03:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
demonstrate its Effectiveness so that
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
others may follow
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Glenn Myers I'm a
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
retired actuary from Deerfield I've been
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire since 2010.
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I want to begin my statement by
 
03:33:51.650 --> 03:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
looking at the 2022 General and special
 
03:33:54.650 --> 03:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
elections in Alaska that elected a
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative for the U.S House
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
what happened on that is that for the
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
special election they were replacing the
 
03:34:06.170 --> 03:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative Don young who passed away
 
03:34:06.180 --> 03:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
representative Don young who passed away
midterm

03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
midterm
 
03:34:09.650 --> 03:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
what they did right there was that was
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
the first ranked Choice voting election
 
03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:16.490 align:start position:0%
the first ranked Choice voting election
that

03:34:16.490 --> 03:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:16.500 --> 03:34:17.229 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:34:17.229 --> 03:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
that Alaska held and what happened about
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
it now if you've got the handout right
 
03:34:26.450 --> 03:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:28.969 --> 03:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
um what happens is I put in some of the
 
03:34:33.290 --> 03:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
round summaries has bar graphs and you
 
03:34:36.290 --> 03:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
will see that in the first
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
special election Sarah Palin got the
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
second most number of votes and
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
um what happened is that Nick bagich was
 
03:34:48.889 --> 03:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
eliminated now because we had two
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
Republicans running against each other
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
they had a tendency to fight each other
 
03:34:56.809 --> 03:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
as if this were a primary
 
03:34:59.630 --> 03:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
and so what happened is that many of
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
baggage's votes transferred to Sarah
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
Palin but a few just managed to go over
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
to the Democrat Mary bartola
 
03:35:11.150 --> 03:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
and then the next thing you'll notice is
 
03:35:13.490 --> 03:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
that the green bar down at the bottom
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
those were the boats where baggage's
 
03:35:20.570 --> 03:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
people did not vote for a second a rank
 
03:35:22.250 --> 03:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
a rank behind
 
03:35:24.650 --> 03:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
um baggage and so if you were to
 
03:35:27.349 --> 03:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
actually take the exhausted votes and
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
add them to Sarah Palin's vote that
 
03:35:31.450 --> 03:35:31.460 align:start position:0%
would have put her ahead
 
03:35:34.130 --> 03:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
so then what happened is that when they
 
03:35:36.650 --> 03:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
did the next round Mary patola had
 
03:35:39.889 --> 03:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
enough to push her over the um top to
 
03:35:41.330 --> 03:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
get elected
 
03:35:44.990 --> 03:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay now in the runoff then in the
 
03:35:47.210 --> 03:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
subsequent election okay Republicans
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
were a little bit upset at that and so
 
03:35:52.729 --> 03:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
what happens is that they instituted
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
what they call a rank the red campaign
 
03:35:59.210 --> 03:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
urging their voters to vote for somebody
 
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
in the other party in their next rank
 
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay and also right there peltola made a
 
03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:07.070 align:start position:0%
okay and also right there peltola made a
definite

03:36:07.070 --> 03:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
definite
 
03:36:08.929 --> 03:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure whether this is shift
 
03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
but to represent to she hired um Don
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
Young's former Chief of Staff she
 
03:36:18.889 --> 03:36:18.899 align:start position:0%
supported the Alaska specific
 
03:36:21.550 --> 03:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
um policies toward fishing and energy
 
03:36:25.490 --> 03:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
and as a result right there if you look
 
03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
at the um next run there behind
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
um much more many more votes from Sarah
 
03:36:32.520 --> 03:36:33.830 align:start position:0%
um much more many more votes from Sarah
Palin

03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
Palin
 
03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:34.849 align:start position:0%
Palin
um

03:36:34.849 --> 03:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know I'm basically from baggage went
 
03:36:38.580 --> 03:36:40.370 align:start position:0%
you know I'm basically from baggage went
to

03:36:40.370 --> 03:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:42.769 --> 03:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
um Sarah Palin there was just enough
 
03:36:42.779 --> 03:36:44.330 align:start position:0%
um Sarah Palin there was just enough
votes

03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
votes
 
03:36:44.340 --> 03:36:46.309 align:start position:0%
votes
for

03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:36:50.570 --> 03:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
um for patola to um get elected because
 
03:36:53.330 --> 03:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
she was the incumbent so she had a good
 
03:36:55.130 --> 03:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
start on that
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay there's a lesson to be learned from
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
this basically the moral of the story is
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
that negative campaigning is very risky
 
03:37:05.690 --> 03:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
you want to get
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
the second place votes for other people
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
that you were attacking before
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
the other thing right here is that here
 
03:37:17.590 --> 03:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
you had a palace an election where two
 
03:37:20.210 --> 03:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
Republican candidates were fighting out
 
03:37:22.610 --> 03:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
between each other to go after a single
 
03:37:25.610 --> 03:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
Democrat political parties may want to
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
resolve any internal differences before
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
they advance to the general election
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay and that's something that is done
 
03:37:36.650 --> 03:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
in Maine where they have ranked Choice
 
03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
voting for both the primaries and for
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
the general
 
03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
now the other statement is that voters
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
should rank multiple if not all
 
03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:46.670 align:start position:0%
should rank multiple if not all
candidates

03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
03:37:49.370 --> 03:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
has I think Ellen pointed out right here
 
03:37:51.889 --> 03:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
a lower ranked Choice vote will not be
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
counted as a vote until the higher rank
 
03:37:58.130 --> 03:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
Choice vote is either eliminated or
 
03:37:58.140 --> 03:37:59.809 align:start position:0%
Choice vote is either eliminated or
elected

03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
elected
 
03:38:03.769 --> 03:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
so with these um I think is the there's
 
03:38:06.290 --> 03:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
going to be a learning curve connected
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
with ranked Choice voting on both the
 
03:38:11.929 --> 03:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
candidates and the voters part and the I
 
03:38:13.490 --> 03:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
like the ranked Choice voting because
 
03:38:17.090 --> 03:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
the skill needed right there to get
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
elected more closely resembles the skill
 
03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
needed to get
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
um to run a government
 
03:38:27.530 --> 03:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
this is in contrast to some of the
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
campaigns where the main skill consists
 
03:38:32.090 --> 03:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
of being able to generate rage against
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
your opponent
 
03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
and with that I will finish saying I
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
really think you should pass this law
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:07.130 --> 03:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:07.140 --> 03:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.210 --> 03:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Smith and members um
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking a few minutes I'll
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
be brief
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
um Eric tur from Brentwood Rockingham
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
District six
 
03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:22.969 align:start position:0%
District six
um and

03:39:22.969 --> 03:39:22.979 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:39:24.889 --> 03:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
um and basically here primarily to
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
fulfill a campaign promise that I made
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
um I was interested in ranked Choice
 
03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
voting long before I ran for
 
03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:32.330 align:start position:0%
voting long before I ran for
um

03:39:32.330 --> 03:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh office for many of the reasons that
 
03:39:37.969 --> 03:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
were mentioned by the previous speakers
 
03:39:40.370 --> 03:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
um as I ran I knocked on probably over
 
03:39:42.530 --> 03:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
800 doors in my district and I was
 
03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
surprised that behind taxes and the hot
 
03:39:47.690 --> 03:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
button social issues that came up
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
reducing partisanship was one of the top
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
priorities that I heard from people
 
03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:53.570 align:start position:0%
priorities that I heard from people
um

03:39:53.570 --> 03:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:55.370 --> 03:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
it was asked of me on candidates night
 
03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
when we were running what I could do to
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
reduce partisanship uh ranked Choice
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
voting has always been my answer for
 
03:40:03.410 --> 03:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
this uh I think it's the most tangible
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
and practical solution that we can
 
03:40:05.760 --> 03:40:06.790 align:start position:0%
and practical solution that we can
Implement

03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
Implement
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve that goal
 
03:40:12.050 --> 03:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
every person I explained ranked Choice
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
voting to and some knew who what it was
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
already but others said it made sense
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
they liked it they liked that it offered
 
03:40:22.610 --> 03:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
no partisan Advantage they liked that it
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
still allowed them to just vote for one
 
03:40:25.969 --> 03:40:25.979 align:start position:0%
person if that's what if that was their
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
Preference they don't have to go all the
 
03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:28.550 align:start position:0%
Preference they don't have to go all the
way

03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:40:31.010 --> 03:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
um down the list so
 
03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll just summarize and say I
 
03:40:35.450 --> 03:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
think that this ought to pass and I hope
 
03:40:38.090 --> 03:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
that's how you'll um how you'll vote on
 
03:40:41.330 --> 03:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
this measure let towns like mine decide
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
whether they want to try it or not
 
03:40:46.729 --> 03:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
um it'll have impacts Beyond just who
 
03:40:48.889 --> 03:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
wins the election it will change who
 
03:40:51.769 --> 03:40:51.779 align:start position:0%
runs for elections and who what issues
 
03:40:54.309 --> 03:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
get discussed thank you
 
03:40:58.670 --> 03:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:07.490 --> 03:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:41:13.130 --> 03:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire I represent the
 
03:41:16.190 --> 03:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom here in Merrimack County
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposed to these these two bills
 
03:41:21.650 --> 03:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
because I think that ranked Choice
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
voting is flawed it it has many of the
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
same drawbacks our current system does
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
and adds new ones
 
03:41:33.410 --> 03:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and and there are better choices I'm
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
not somebody who inherently is against
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
alternative voting schemes I've proposed
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
such bills myself but but this is not
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
um a particularly good one I've handed
 
03:41:47.929 --> 03:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
out a piece of paper that gives some
 
03:41:50.809 --> 03:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
examples of details I'm not going to go
 
03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
through them but
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
in particular the first one is a very
 
03:41:59.929 --> 03:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
simple example of how ranked Choice
 
03:42:03.410 --> 03:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
voting can choose the wrong winner
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
right the one that clearly is not the
 
03:42:07.790 --> 03:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
choice of the voters
 
03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
and the typical example used here is the
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
City of Burlington Vermont had ranked
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
choice for their mayor for a short
 
03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
period of time and an example similar to
 
03:42:22.130 --> 03:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
this came up there they picked the wrong
 
03:42:24.650 --> 03:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
person for mayor people felt it and they
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
secondly for ranked Choice voting
 
03:42:34.490 --> 03:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
the counting has to be centralized
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so either as we've heard you ship
 
03:42:40.309 --> 03:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
all the ballots to Concord and do the
 
03:42:42.769 --> 03:42:42.779 align:start position:0%
counting there or you have some kind of
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
computer system where all the towns are
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
are connected together
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
um so this is a complex system it's it's
 
03:42:53.690 --> 03:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
not easy to understand it's more
 
03:42:57.429 --> 03:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
susceptible to to fraud and error
 
03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
and so if you're going to do something
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
this complicated there are better
 
03:43:05.090 --> 03:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
methods so so effectively if you're
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
going to put in a computer system to
 
03:43:09.410 --> 03:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
count all the ballots why not program it
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
correctly with a better system than this
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and a better example is a system
 
03:43:17.170 --> 03:43:17.180 align:start position:0%
called condorset
 
03:43:21.650 --> 03:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
finally this is confusing right so uh
 
03:43:23.690 --> 03:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
we've heard the example of Australia so
 
03:43:25.490 --> 03:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting was invented in
 
03:43:28.250 --> 03:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
Australia roughly a hundred years ago I
 
03:43:30.290 --> 03:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
happen to be visiting Australia once I'm
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
interested in this issue and I asked
 
03:43:35.330 --> 03:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
people to explain to me how it worked
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know I I met people randomly a dozen
 
03:43:41.150 --> 03:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
people who thought it was good and I
 
03:43:43.610 --> 03:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
said to them explain to me how it's how
 
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
they choose the winner not a single
 
03:43:48.650 --> 03:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
person could explain it to me if you
 
03:43:50.870 --> 03:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
read the bill starting on page three
 
03:43:53.929 --> 03:43:53.939 align:start position:0%
you'll understand why I challenge you to
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
read that stuff
 
03:43:58.729 --> 03:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
and and understand it it's not easy
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay whereas our current system I think
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
I could go to anybody and say how does
 
03:44:04.610 --> 03:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
it work you say we count all the votes
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
and we the one that's biggest wins right
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
so it's complicated and so if you're
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to go with this level of
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
complication there's there are better
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
choices if you want to stay with the
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
current level of complication there are
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
better choices also in particular one
 
03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
called approval voting
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
now you've heard a couple of incorrect
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
things in my opinion reducing
 
03:44:30.050 --> 03:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
partisanship this is not designed to
 
03:44:32.809 --> 03:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
reduce partisanship this is designed
 
03:44:34.490 --> 03:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
because it eliminates the little party
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
guys from the bottom it keeps the
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
Democrat and the Republican in play and
 
03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
it moves the little parties votes into
 
03:44:45.050 --> 03:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
their columns that's what's going on
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
there will still be plenty of
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
partisanship with this method the other
 
03:44:50.570 --> 03:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
methods that I've talked about really
 
03:44:54.050 --> 03:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
are non-partisan this one is not
 
03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
you've also heard a fair amount about
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
Alaska Alaska's system while technically
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
called ranked Choice has another large
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
feature that's not in these bills and so
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
they they effectively eliminated
 
03:45:09.050 --> 03:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
separate primaries for republicans and
 
03:45:12.290 --> 03:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
Democrats so I it's hard to use their
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
system as an example for what these
 
03:45:16.190 --> 03:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
bills would do
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
and with that Mr chairman I will
 
03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:20.090 align:start position:0%
and with that Mr chairman I will
conclude

03:45:20.090 --> 03:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
conclude
 
03:45:23.929 --> 03:45:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take questions I am
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative LeBron the only
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions of the hour I guess
 
03:45:37.010 --> 03:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
um speaking about Australia I looked up
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
the voting rates in Australia and
 
03:45:41.950 --> 03:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
learned that they are
 
03:45:45.410 --> 03:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
mandatory the the Voting is mandatory in
 
03:45:47.809 --> 03:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
Australia so the voting rates are very
 
03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
high because you will be fined if you
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
don't vote I thought that was
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
interesting did you find when you were
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
there that there was a lack of
 
03:45:58.849 --> 03:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
partisanship that there was less
 
03:46:00.889 --> 03:46:00.899 align:start position:0%
partisanship than say other places
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
you've been to when you've assessed the
 
03:46:05.389 --> 03:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
political situation yes thank you for
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
the question representative
 
03:46:10.130 --> 03:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
um not specifically although I didn't I
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
didn't probe sort of those those kind of
 
03:46:12.600 --> 03:46:14.570 align:start position:0%
didn't probe sort of those those kind of
question

03:46:14.570 --> 03:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
um but the the general feeling was they
 
03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
thought they had a great system and I it
 
03:46:21.650 --> 03:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
was all because it was invented there
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
right it's ours it must be great right
 
03:46:27.469 --> 03:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
but but when you ask go into details how
 
03:46:29.150 --> 03:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
does it work
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
you know who knows right it's like
 
03:46:31.380 --> 03:46:34.070 align:start position:0%
you know who knows right it's like
anyway

03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and the committee
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
I'm Jessica LaMontagne from Stratford
 
03:46:53.399 --> 03:46:54.410 align:start position:0%
I'm Jessica LaMontagne from Stratford
County

03:46:54.410 --> 03:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
County
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be very brief
 
03:46:57.600 --> 03:46:59.030 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be very brief
um

03:46:59.030 --> 03:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:01.550 --> 03:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
I think ranked Choice voting
 
03:47:03.530 --> 03:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
helps us find the highest common
 
03:47:03.540 --> 03:47:04.729 align:start position:0%
helps us find the highest common
denominator

03:47:04.729 --> 03:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
denominator
 
03:47:07.729 --> 03:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
among our candidates
 
03:47:07.739 --> 03:47:08.750 align:start position:0%
among our candidates
um

03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
and that helps us find an affinity for
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
the candidate that most people like
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that in itself is how we
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
reduce partisanship
 
03:47:18.720 --> 03:47:21.229 align:start position:0%
reduce partisanship
and

03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:23.389 --> 03:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
another thing is the status of being the
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary
 
03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
how more compelling would it be if we're
 
03:47:30.290 --> 03:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
on the Vanguard
 
03:47:33.290 --> 03:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
of ranked Choice voting
 
03:47:36.650 --> 03:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
that further set end
 
03:47:38.570 --> 03:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
um so I don't want to go into all the
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
other details that was said
 
03:47:42.410 --> 03:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
but as far as bills
 
03:47:45.050 --> 03:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
um being so much more complicated and
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:47:49.490 --> 03:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
when you look at the legal language
 
03:47:51.170 --> 03:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
um that's true about almost any bill
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we see in a committee I would say
 
03:47:57.290 --> 03:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
and I Echo a representative Turner's
 
03:47:59.809 --> 03:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
impression that one I talked to voters
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
about it
 
03:48:03.769 --> 03:48:03.779 align:start position:0%
um they seem to grasp the concept very
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
easily and we're very much in favor of
 
03:48:06.239 --> 03:48:07.130 align:start position:0%
easily and we're very much in favor of
it

03:48:07.130 --> 03:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:48:09.710 --> 03:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
03:48:18.650 --> 03:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.769 --> 03:48:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.010 --> 03:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
hello thank you
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
um again I am Tiani Coleman I reside in
 
03:48:35.929 --> 03:48:35.939 align:start position:0%
Amherst New Hampshire and have been
 
03:48:37.250 --> 03:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
living there for about nine and a half
 
03:48:37.260 --> 03:48:38.450 align:start position:0%
living there for about nine and a half
years

03:48:38.450 --> 03:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
I um before I moved to Amherst I lived
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
in Utah and some of you know this
 
03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
already but um I became introduced and I
 
03:48:49.969 --> 03:48:49.979 align:start position:0%
got to know ranked Choice voting in Utah
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the early 2000s I was actually at the
 
03:48:56.330 --> 03:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
time I'm now an independent voter but at
 
03:48:58.429 --> 03:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
the time I was the chair of the Salt
 
03:49:00.969 --> 03:49:00.979 align:start position:0%
Lake County Republican party out in Utah
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
and we used ranked Choice voting for our
 
03:49:07.370 --> 03:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
Republican conventions in Utah and they
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
still do use it in the Democratic party
 
03:49:12.170 --> 03:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
also uses it in their conventions
 
03:49:16.729 --> 03:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
um we had a race in Utah in in 2002 that
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
was um a congressional race with 12
 
03:49:21.650 --> 03:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
candidates and it went very smoothly and
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
it turned out really well
 
03:49:26.750 --> 03:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
and then in 2004 we had a race for
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
governor that had eight candidates this
 
03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
these were convention races but they
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
they went very well and since then after
 
03:49:38.929 --> 03:49:38.939 align:start position:0%
I moved away from Utah in 2018 Utah
 
03:49:41.929 --> 03:49:41.939 align:start position:0%
adopted a local option bill for their
 
03:49:44.929 --> 03:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to adopt and use
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting for their Municipal
 
03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
elections and over over 30 I think it's
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
20 that have actually used it but over
 
03:49:56.690 --> 03:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
30 opted in to use it only over 20
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually did use it because some of them
 
03:50:00.290 --> 03:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough people on the ballot
 
03:50:02.269 --> 03:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
to actually trigger ranked choice
 
03:50:02.279 --> 03:50:03.530 align:start position:0%
to actually trigger ranked choice
but

03:50:03.530 --> 03:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
um they have had very positive reviews
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if Amelia Gardner at
 
03:50:12.170 --> 03:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
the county a former Utah County Clerk
 
03:50:13.969 --> 03:50:13.979 align:start position:0%
submitted her testimony this year or not
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
but I know she did last year and she was
 
03:50:18.889 --> 03:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
a county clerk in Utah County that
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
implemented it for the first time
 
03:50:23.450 --> 03:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
and had only positive things to say
 
03:50:25.490 --> 03:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
about it and it was very good and the
 
03:50:28.610 --> 03:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
Salt Lake County Clerk also in Utah has
 
03:50:30.769 --> 03:50:30.779 align:start position:0%
very positive uh things to say about
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting I actually met with
 
03:50:35.210 --> 03:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
the Salt Lake County Clerk way back in
 
03:50:37.849 --> 03:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s and you know she had
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
been fixed County Clerk for a very long
 
03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
time and at the time she was like uh I
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
don't know you know I don't know how I
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
feel about this and all these things but
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
once they actually implemented it and
 
03:50:49.729 --> 03:50:49.739 align:start position:0%
she used it she's a big supporter and
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
you will find that over and over and
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
over again everywhere where they
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
implement it it happened with Secretary
 
03:50:57.290 --> 03:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
of State Dunlap when they were first
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
bringing the ballot initiative in Maine
 
03:51:01.969 --> 03:51:01.979 align:start position:0%
the former Secretary of State
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
um he was a little bit worried about it
 
03:51:05.450 --> 03:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
negative about it he had things to say
 
03:51:07.190 --> 03:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
oh I think it might cost too much oh I
 
03:51:08.570 --> 03:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be complicated oh I
 
03:51:10.190 --> 03:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be hard to educate
 
03:51:13.550 --> 03:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
voters but he you know he he was his
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
hand was forced he had to implement it
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
because they passed the ballot
 
03:51:19.130 --> 03:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
initiative and once he implemented it he
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
only had good things to say they they
 
03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
were were able to pull it off in two
 
03:51:24.889 --> 03:51:24.899 align:start position:0%
months I mean they didn't know that they
 
03:51:26.090 --> 03:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
were going to have to use ranked Choice
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
voting I think until April it wasn't
 
03:51:29.690 --> 03:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
finalized that they were going to have
 
03:51:31.969 --> 03:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
to use it in their June primary and they
 
03:51:34.610 --> 03:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
pulled it off in two months or so and
 
03:51:37.490 --> 03:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
had a very positive experience that was
 
03:51:39.530 --> 03:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
smooth they'd ran exit polls in Maine
 
03:51:42.290 --> 03:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
over 85 percent of Voters said that they
 
03:51:44.150 --> 03:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
found it easy to understand easy to use
 
03:51:47.809 --> 03:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
easy to do over uh I can't remember the
 
03:51:50.030 --> 03:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
exact numbers was like 60 or 70 percent
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
said they wanted to keep using it they
 
03:51:55.010 --> 03:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
loved it and and we see that play out
 
03:51:57.170 --> 03:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
because in Maine they had another you
 
03:51:59.090 --> 03:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
know they had to have the have it on the
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
ballot multiple times different times
 
03:52:04.250 --> 03:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
and it passed every single time and then
 
03:52:05.929 --> 03:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
they even expanded it when they first
 
03:52:08.150 --> 03:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
passed it it wasn't for the presidential
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
general election or or for the
 
03:52:11.570 --> 03:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries now they are
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
using it for the presidential general
 
03:52:14.570 --> 03:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
election and the presidential primaries
 
03:52:17.809 --> 03:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
and this is the same story you find
 
03:52:19.190 --> 03:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
um everywhere where it's been
 
03:52:21.889 --> 03:52:21.899 align:start position:0%
implemented I you might might know that
 
03:52:24.650 --> 03:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
I sent you all slides last night that go
 
03:52:26.510 --> 03:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
into very uh well they were slides now
 
03:52:28.130 --> 03:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
it's a PDF document but they go into
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
very a lot of details and you can review
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
that and one of the slides has
 
03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
um a link to data from fairvote that has
 
03:52:39.650 --> 03:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
all of the studies a lot a lot of the
 
03:52:41.650 --> 03:52:41.660 align:start position:0%
exit polls and all the things that show
 
03:52:44.809 --> 03:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
all of the positive real world example
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
results of ranked Choice voting
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the positive reviews by
 
03:52:52.190 --> 03:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
people that they like it the the smooth
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
implementation of it the very very low
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
error rate in voter voters casting
 
03:52:57.420 --> 03:52:58.910 align:start position:0%
error rate in voter voters casting
ballots

03:52:58.910 --> 03:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
um that I mean they really don't get
 
03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
very many complaints now some people say
 
03:53:05.450 --> 03:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
oh you know it took so long and maybe in
 
03:53:07.370 --> 03:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
Maine or in Alaska or there was a glitch
 
03:53:10.010 --> 03:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
in New York City all of those none of
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
those things had to do with ranked
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
Choice voting every one of those things
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
had to do with either the law of estate
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
or a glitch that had nothing to do with
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting like in New York
 
03:53:19.080 --> 03:53:20.690 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting like in New York
City

03:53:20.690 --> 03:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
City
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
um they really had a very smooth ranked
 
03:53:24.530 --> 03:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
Choice election they did have a glitch
 
03:53:26.570 --> 03:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
with ballots prior to that but it wasn't
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
related to the ranked Choice voting
 
03:53:30.650 --> 03:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
election itself it was ranked related to
 
03:53:32.510 --> 03:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
the ballot commission messing up
 
03:53:35.150 --> 03:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
something in their uh messing up
 
03:53:37.849 --> 03:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
something in their programming of it had
 
03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the ranked Choice
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
um and the same with Maine and Alaska
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
the delay in their results is due to
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
their state law allowing for a lot of
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
time for the ballots to come in or they
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
have absentee ballot laws that allow
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots to come in for two
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
weeks for example in Alaska so that
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
would not be you know be relevant here
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
um I just want to remind all of you one
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
more time that this bill
 
03:54:06.050 --> 03:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
um is an enabling Bill only HP 345 it's
 
03:54:09.170 --> 03:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
only you know to allow municipalities to
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
opt in if they want
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
or to allow parties to opt in to use it
 
03:54:14.929 --> 03:54:14.939 align:start position:0%
in primaries if they want
 
03:54:17.690 --> 03:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
that really means that all of you really
 
03:54:19.849 --> 03:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
should support this bill even if you're
 
03:54:22.370 --> 03:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
not a huge fan of ranked Choice voting
 
03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
now I know a lot of you are a huge fan
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
of ring Choice voting but even if you're
 
03:54:27.710 --> 03:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
not this is a bill that you can support
 
03:54:29.389 --> 03:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
because what you're saying if you're
 
03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
someone who supports Liberty and freedom
 
03:54:34.910 --> 03:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
and good government you would support
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
giving that option to people who want to
 
03:54:40.969 --> 03:54:40.979 align:start position:0%
use it if a municipality wants to use it
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's local government control that
 
03:54:44.809 --> 03:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
small government control that's
 
03:54:46.849 --> 03:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
something that you should want to let
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities opt into if they want to
 
03:54:51.290 --> 03:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
and they you know they will have to go
 
03:54:53.630 --> 03:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
through the entire process themselves
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
to make that determination in a vote of
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
their own voters but if they want to do
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
that let them hold a municipal local
 
03:55:01.790 --> 03:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
municipal election using ranked Choice
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
voting and the same with parties you
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
know if if a party really wants their
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
primary to be held with ranked Choice
 
03:55:11.210 --> 03:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
voting let them opt into that if if your
 
03:55:12.769 --> 03:55:12.779 align:start position:0%
party doesn't want to they don't have to
 
03:55:15.050 --> 03:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
if a party does want to they can and a
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
party might want to for One race because
 
03:55:18.889 --> 03:55:18.899 align:start position:0%
they might say oh we know that this
 
03:55:20.210 --> 03:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
particular primary is going to have a
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
lot of candidates it's going to be ugly
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to result in great party
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
division we're not going to be able to
 
03:55:26.210 --> 03:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
unify around someone for a general
 
03:55:26.220 --> 03:55:27.050 align:start position:0%
unify around someone for a general
election

03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:55:29.929 --> 03:55:29.939 align:start position:0%
and you know by allowing them to opt in
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
you're letting them do that and then
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
they can opt out if they don't like it
 
03:55:34.729 --> 03:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
or don't want to use it again or if they
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't need it for a different election I
 
03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
think you should you know give that
 
03:55:40.610 --> 03:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
option because believe me people will
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
want that option
 
03:55:47.090 --> 03:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
um I um in in party primaries a lot of
 
03:55:50.090 --> 03:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
times you I think in this last year you
 
03:55:51.410 --> 03:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
saw what happened with some of the
 
03:55:53.689 --> 03:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
primaries people weren't really happy
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
with some of some of the results because
 
03:55:58.370 --> 03:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
they felt like you know it was a low
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
percentage and it was a vote split and
 
03:56:02.570 --> 03:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting might have helped
 
03:56:04.969 --> 03:56:04.979 align:start position:0%
that and you saw I I was here earlier
 
03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
and there there are some people who have
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
submitted a bill for runoff elections
 
03:56:13.010 --> 03:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
for primaries and
 
03:56:15.290 --> 03:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
that shows that people see that there's
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
a need to do something better than what
 
03:56:19.610 --> 03:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
we have now
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
and ranked Choice voting will do that
 
03:56:23.170 --> 03:56:23.180 align:start position:0%
without the negatives
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
so since I mentioned that I'll just say
 
03:56:27.050 --> 03:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
real quickly here too although we can
 
03:56:28.450 --> 03:56:28.460 align:start position:0%
address it when we're in the next bill
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
but this bill HB 345
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
has absolutely zero zero zero
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues though the whole
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
plurality provision we can talk about
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
that on the next bill we'll discuss it
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
but on this bill it is completely
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
irrelevant there is no constitutional
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
issue on this bill whatsoever because
 
03:56:49.370 --> 03:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
the plurality provision in the New
 
03:56:51.530 --> 03:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitution does not in any
 
03:56:54.650 --> 03:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
way touch primary elections and it does
 
03:56:57.950 --> 03:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
not in any way touch Municipal elections
 
03:57:01.429 --> 03:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
and so it is 100 percent not not
 
03:57:01.439 --> 03:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
and so it is 100 percent not not
relevant

03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
um if you know if you want to talk more
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
about constitutionality I'm happy to go
 
03:57:08.929 --> 03:57:08.939 align:start position:0%
into the details in the next bill
 
03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
um I the same with the other things I
 
03:57:12.290 --> 03:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
have a lot I could say a lot about
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
Alaska and what happened there
 
03:57:17.210 --> 03:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and I can talk more about these
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
alternative voting methods that were
 
03:57:20.090 --> 03:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
discussed but I think I will save those
 
03:57:21.769 --> 03:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
for the next bill
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
and just say that ranked Choice voting
 
03:57:28.729 --> 03:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
is indeed something that um
 
03:57:31.729 --> 03:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
that does reduce
 
03:57:33.050 --> 03:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
um partisanship and helps people
 
03:57:35.689 --> 03:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
coalesce around each other and it helps
 
03:57:37.250 --> 03:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
people really have their voice heard and
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's one of the most important things
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
is that every voter wants to really have
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
their voice heard and even if I mean if
 
03:57:47.090 --> 03:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
you go vote and you like someone and
 
03:57:49.010 --> 03:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
they don't win the way it stands right
 
03:57:49.020 --> 03:57:49.849 align:start position:0%
they don't win the way it stands right
now

03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:57:52.370 --> 03:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
I mean it's just you feel like your vote
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
didn't really especially if they only
 
03:57:55.130 --> 03:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
got you know a small percentage of the
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
vote you feel you feel like your voice
 
03:57:59.689 --> 03:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
wasn't really heard
 
03:58:01.849 --> 03:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
in a ranked Choice voting election it
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
may not change the outcome but what
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
happens is that you feel like your voice
 
03:58:07.849 --> 03:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
was heard because it registers
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
it registers that you cared about that
 
03:58:12.290 --> 03:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
person but you can still
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
voice your choice between
 
03:58:16.610 --> 03:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
the other people if your person has no
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
chance of winning so you're able to vote
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
your vote your conscience and express
 
03:58:22.570 --> 03:58:22.580 align:start position:0%
how you feel about the top Runners
 
03:58:26.269 --> 03:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
whereas in a election now you have to
 
03:58:28.010 --> 03:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
make a choice do I vote my conscience or
 
03:58:30.769 --> 03:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
do I make a meaningful vote and you have
 
03:58:32.090 --> 03:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
to choose one or the other you can't do
 
03:58:34.490 --> 03:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
both and ranked Choice voting you can do
 
03:58:34.500 --> 03:58:35.990 align:start position:0%
both and ranked Choice voting you can do
both

03:58:35.990 --> 03:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:58:40.250 --> 03:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and ranked Choice voting also
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
um allows people to
 
03:58:46.250 --> 03:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
it allows people to have a more evil
 
03:58:49.550 --> 03:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
even a more even playing field right now
 
03:58:51.290 --> 03:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of candidates really don't have
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
much of a chance if they're but once
 
03:58:54.530 --> 03:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
again I'll talk about that in the next
 
03:58:56.090 --> 03:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
bill because it's not super applicable
 
03:58:57.530 --> 03:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
here on this bill that only talks about
 
03:58:59.809 --> 03:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
primaries and municipalities
 
03:59:01.849 --> 03:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
so if you have any questions I'm happy
 
03:59:03.650 --> 03:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might have I
 
03:59:05.570 --> 03:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
will use one more example though real
 
03:59:05.580 --> 03:59:06.290 align:start position:0%
will use one more example though real
quick

03:59:06.290 --> 03:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
quick
 
03:59:07.969 --> 03:59:07.979 align:start position:0%
there was a municipal election that I
 
03:59:10.010 --> 03:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
brought up last year with the Fall River
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
Race in Massachusetts that the town the
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
city of Fall River
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
and in Fall River there was a mayor who
 
03:59:20.510 --> 03:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
was under indictment for federal uh tax
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
evasion I believe in fraud who in the
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
end did end up getting convicted but at
 
03:59:26.570 --> 03:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
the time of the election he was under
 
03:59:28.130 --> 03:59:28.140 align:start position:0%
indictment and so they had a recall
 
03:59:28.140 --> 03:59:29.090 align:start position:0%
indictment and so they had a recall
election

03:59:29.090 --> 03:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:59:32.269 --> 03:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
and in that recall election over 60
 
03:59:34.490 --> 03:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
percent of the voters voted to recall
 
03:59:36.110 --> 03:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
him they did not want him to be the
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
mayor anymore of that town
 
03:59:40.130 --> 03:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
but the way that their ballot was was
 
03:59:42.889 --> 03:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
made they allowed anyone to run so it
 
03:59:45.410 --> 03:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
said if he's recalled who will you put
 
03:59:47.030 --> 03:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
in their place and they allowed him to
 
03:59:49.010 --> 03:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
put his name down as one of the
 
03:59:51.950 --> 03:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
potential people to be elected so he was
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
recalled by more than 60 percent of the
 
03:59:55.370 --> 03:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
vote but then when all of the voters
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
voted 35 percent of the voters voted
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
for him but the other 65 voted against
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
him and but they were split between four
 
04:00:06.050 --> 04:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
other candidates and so that 35 percent
 
04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
ended up being the highest percentage
 
04:00:10.490 --> 04:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
and so he was both recalled and
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
reinstated in the same election which
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
was clearly not what the voters wanted
 
04:00:17.330 --> 04:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
the voters voted to recall them they did
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
not want him more than 60 percent did
 
04:00:21.050 --> 04:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
not want him and even in the election
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
more than 60 percent did not want him
 
04:00:25.610 --> 04:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
but for those other candidates split the
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
vote if they had used ranked Choice
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
voting in that election he would not
 
04:00:31.370 --> 04:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
have been put he would not been
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
re-elected in that race obviously the
 
04:00:35.150 --> 04:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
other four candidates would have ended
 
04:00:36.889 --> 04:00:36.899 align:start position:0%
up having it producing a winner that
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
would have beat him out and that's what
 
04:00:41.809 --> 04:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting does is it helps
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
show who the most voters actually want
 
04:00:46.849 --> 04:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
um and that's what ranked Choice voting
 
04:00:49.790 --> 04:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
does as uh as my colleague said before
 
04:00:52.490 --> 04:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's not a 50 threshold in in ranked
 
04:00:53.689 --> 04:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
Choice voting action there's a 50
 
04:00:56.929 --> 04:00:56.939 align:start position:0%
threshold for automatic winner but
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's not a 50 requirement meaning
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
that because voters are not required to
 
04:01:04.969 --> 04:01:04.979 align:start position:0%
to rank every single candidate they can
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
only rank one if they want or two if
 
04:01:08.450 --> 04:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
they want that means that technically
 
04:01:10.849 --> 04:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
you could get someone who wins at the
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
end of the day with less than 50 of the
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
vote but whether it's 50 or a little
 
04:01:17.570 --> 04:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
less than 50 what it does show for sure
 
04:01:20.929 --> 04:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
is that you have more you have the the
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
person who won with more who has the
 
04:01:26.990 --> 04:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
very most voter support that there's no
 
04:01:28.490 --> 04:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
one else on the ballot that has more
 
04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
voter support
 
04:01:30.180 --> 04:01:31.070 align:start position:0%
voter support
um

04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:32.809 --> 04:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions and leave
 
04:01:43.250 --> 04:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.969 --> 04:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.650 --> 04:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
my name is Nathan Lockwood I'm Executive
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
Director of National nonprofit
 
04:02:01.370 --> 04:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization called ranked
 
04:02:01.380 --> 04:02:02.210 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization called ranked
vote

04:02:02.210 --> 04:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh we work with Grassroots volunteer-led
 
04:02:07.849 --> 04:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
organizations in over 25 States
 
04:02:10.429 --> 04:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
including in New Hampshire and we're
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
really excited I just want to be brief
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
in my points here to to key ones one is
 
04:02:18.170 --> 04:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
that this is a really exciting thing for
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature to have
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to move forward with this
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
bill uh at present there are more than
 
04:02:27.170 --> 04:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
14 State Legislative there are 14 state
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislators they're
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
um considering ranked Choice voting
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislation we expect that number to
 
04:02:33.889 --> 04:02:33.899 align:start position:0%
grow as many of the sessions are just
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
starting and not all the legislation is
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
submitted but it's it's got extreme uh
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh interest in ranked Choice
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
voting is growing a lot especially
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know in the aftermath of the
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
um ranked Choice voting was on the
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
ballot you know across the country in
 
04:02:56.150 --> 04:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
November and eight of ten of those
 
04:02:58.010 --> 04:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
referendo were won including in large
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
many large cities
 
04:03:02.330 --> 04:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
um ranked Choice voting just another
 
04:03:04.610 --> 04:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
indication of the of sort of the
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
mainstream interest and acceptance of it
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
the Virginia Republican party has become
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
a big fan of ranked Choice voting for
 
04:03:13.130 --> 04:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
running their primary elections because
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
they feel it gives them the candidate
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
who has the strongest support within
 
04:03:19.010 --> 04:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
their party and the best chance of
 
04:03:21.710 --> 04:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
mobilizing their voters and winning the
 
04:03:24.170 --> 04:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
general election that was how governor
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
juncken uh was nominated and uh also the
 
04:03:29.929 --> 04:03:29.939 align:start position:0%
other Statewide candidates will win some
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
Sears and the others and so they
 
04:03:33.710 --> 04:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
continued to use it after their first
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
run there in in Virginia it's kind of an
 
04:03:38.330 --> 04:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than most States
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
the the parties have the option of using
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
the public primary system
 
04:03:47.150 --> 04:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
or uh doing private primaries and
 
04:03:48.769 --> 04:03:48.779 align:start position:0%
conducting them as they see fit and so
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
they chose to take it private and run
 
04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
ranked choice
 
04:03:55.490 --> 04:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
so Secretary of State of Georgia Brad
 
04:03:58.130 --> 04:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
raffensberger is looking to save Georgia
 
04:04:00.170 --> 04:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
the cost of these expensive Senate
 
04:04:03.050 --> 04:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
runoffs uh their last two uh Senate
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
runoffs cost between 50 and 75 million
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
dollars each and it drags out as other
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
speakers have talked about drags out the
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
election season he's presenting three
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
options before the legislature to
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate the runoffs for general
 
04:04:18.170 --> 04:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
elections and uh ranked Choice voting is
 
04:04:20.570 --> 04:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
one of them and then Elsewhere on the
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
political Spectrum Amy Walter of cook
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
political report recently asked for more
 
04:04:27.290 --> 04:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
ranks voting across the country for her
 
04:04:29.870 --> 04:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh Christmas present so there you go
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's got got a lot of support in the
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
mainstream uh political analysts public
 
04:04:37.969 --> 04:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
officials uh even those responsible for
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
voting Etc
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
um real quick thing I want to say is you
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire moving forward with
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting today New Hampshire
 
04:04:45.769 --> 04:04:45.779 align:start position:0%
is a state that has significant
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
similarities with Maine you know Maine's
 
04:04:49.370 --> 04:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
kind of a purple State people with range
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
of perspectives New Hampshire as well I
 
04:04:51.720 --> 04:04:52.429 align:start position:0%
of perspectives New Hampshire as well I
think

04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
Alaska has a very independent bent which
 
04:04:56.090 --> 04:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
has some similarities with those States
 
04:04:58.490 --> 04:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
so and I think the the positive
 
04:05:00.650 --> 04:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
reception in those States I think you
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
can be confident you would see here as
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
well the other great thing about
 
04:05:06.290 --> 04:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
adopting ranked Choice voting today is
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
um there's more National organizations
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
that are better resourced today than
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
there were even just two years ago or
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
four years ago and so you've got an
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
excellent piece of testimony uh that was
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
submitted from the ranked Choice voting
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
Resource Center which is the leading
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
National Organization in terms of
 
04:05:24.530 --> 04:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
supporting jurisdictions that are either
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to move forward with ranked Choice
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
voting or in fact are moving forward
 
04:05:29.330 --> 04:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
with it and I think you'll you'll see
 
04:05:30.769 --> 04:05:30.779 align:start position:0%
just from the testimony that was
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
submitted the level of expertise there
 
04:05:35.570 --> 04:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that expertise uh RCV
 
04:05:37.849 --> 04:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
resource center and others are willing
 
04:05:40.610 --> 04:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
to um put resources on the ground to
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
help uh administrators in New Hampshire
 
04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
both at the state and local level
 
04:05:45.420 --> 04:05:47.750 align:start position:0%
both at the state and local level
support

04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
um candidates who need to learn how to
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
run under the new system and also
 
04:05:54.050 --> 04:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
support in voter education efforts
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
um in Alaska when they move forward in
 
04:05:58.130 --> 04:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
with all accounts it was a very
 
04:06:00.290 --> 04:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
successful administrative execution of
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
their first ranked Choice voting
 
04:06:02.570 --> 04:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
elections including the special election
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
which happened earlier than anyone
 
04:06:04.319 --> 04:06:06.590 align:start position:0%
which happened earlier than anyone
expected

04:06:06.590 --> 04:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
expected
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
um National organizations devoted
 
04:06:11.809 --> 04:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
significant resources probably on the
 
04:06:13.729 --> 04:06:13.739 align:start position:0%
order of you know over a million dollars
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
to ensuring uh that uh that the Alaskan
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
administrators candidates and voters had
 
04:06:22.729 --> 04:06:22.739 align:start position:0%
the information they need for the most
 
04:06:24.650 --> 04:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
successful rollout
 
04:06:27.290 --> 04:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
so um so if you like the benefits and
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
you want to move forward and I as the
 
04:06:30.410 --> 04:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
other speakers said there's a lot to
 
04:06:30.420 --> 04:06:31.309 align:start position:0%
other speakers said there's a lot to
like

04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:06:33.410 --> 04:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
um you know strongly encourage you to uh
 
04:06:35.330 --> 04:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
know that you'll have the support you
 
04:06:36.830 --> 04:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
need to make it successful so thanks
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the chairman for the record my name
 
04:06:57.050 --> 04:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
is Olivia Zink and I'm the executive
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
director of open democracy action a
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan non-profit Pro voter
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
organization with 36 000 members and I
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
live in Franklin New Hampshire
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to speak about three uh
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
reasons why I support this bill I think
 
04:07:13.689 --> 04:07:13.699 align:start position:0%
it's important for us to realize that
 
04:07:16.849 --> 04:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
almost 13 million voters use ranked
 
04:07:18.590 --> 04:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
Choice voting we know it works
 
04:07:20.510 --> 04:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Cambridge Massachusetts
 
04:07:22.849 --> 04:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
has used a proportional ranked Choice
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
voting since
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
1941 for city council and school
 
04:07:30.650 --> 04:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
committee nominations
 
04:07:32.689 --> 04:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
um ranked Choice voting is nonpartisan
 
04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
it gives voters more choice and a
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
greater voice at the at the polls
 
04:07:38.520 --> 04:07:39.170 align:start position:0%
greater voice at the at the polls
um

04:07:39.170 --> 04:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:41.330 --> 04:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting also decreases
 
04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
polarization for example if I had this
 
04:07:46.610 --> 04:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
ballot I personally like moose tracks
 
04:07:48.650 --> 04:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
ice cream the most and so I would
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
campaign for moose tracks ice cream but
 
04:07:52.610 --> 04:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
if you liked vanilla ice cream I
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily bash you if you
 
04:07:57.170 --> 04:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
liked vanilla ice cream because you
 
04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
could choose vanilla as your first
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
choice and I could convince you that
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
maybe moose tracks would be your second
 
04:08:03.650 --> 04:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
choice but if you don't like peanut
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
butter cups and you want to pick
 
04:08:07.010 --> 04:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
strawberry ice cream you would do that
 
04:08:10.250 --> 04:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
but I think voters see and we see so
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
much negative campaigning in our current
 
04:08:15.290 --> 04:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
system this is a way where we could be
 
04:08:18.410 --> 04:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
positive about campaigning and and talk
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
about the merits of our first choice and
 
04:08:25.729 --> 04:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
not just bash art our opponents which
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
our current system does
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
I also want to speak to ranked Choice
 
04:08:32.809 --> 04:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
voting in multi-member districts on page
 
04:08:35.210 --> 04:08:35.220 align:start position:0%
five it says multi-representative but on
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
I mean page five it talks page five line
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
11 we talk about multi-member
 
04:08:44.750 --> 04:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
districts but on page two line 18. many
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
of you went through the redistricting
 
04:08:47.889 --> 04:08:47.899 align:start position:0%
process this year and learned about
 
04:08:51.290 --> 04:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts and I think that
 
04:08:53.450 --> 04:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting in a multi-member
 
04:08:55.370 --> 04:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
district where it's been gerrymandered
 
04:08:58.610 --> 04:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
gives voters more voice because they
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't feel like they're
 
04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
that the the people drawing the map are
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
drawing the map for any partisan gain
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts is really where
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting can have a positive
 
04:09:12.239 --> 04:09:13.490 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting can have a positive
impact

04:09:13.490 --> 04:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
impact
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
um in those gerrymandered districts and
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
voters say that gerrymandered districts
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
lead leads them to not have confidence
 
04:09:22.250 --> 04:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
in our elections so just wanted to
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
comment on multi-member districts
 
04:09:27.530 --> 04:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take questions
 
04:09:30.410 --> 04:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:36.530 --> 04:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.290 --> 04:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
name is Patricia Lovejoy I am the senior
 
04:09:52.809 --> 04:09:52.819 align:start position:0%
second senior deputy secretary of state
 
04:09:56.510 --> 04:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh this bill speaks to both
 
04:10:00.370 --> 04:10:00.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities and to State primaries
 
04:10:02.929 --> 04:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
since the municipalities run their own
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
elections and the state does not control
 
04:10:07.130 --> 04:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
those I will keep my comments just to
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
the state primaries
 
04:10:09.720 --> 04:10:10.510 align:start position:0%
the state primaries
um

04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:14.210 --> 04:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
on a state primary night we don't
 
04:10:15.889 --> 04:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
necessarily know
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
we don't know the winners until later
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
that night and many times it's early in
 
04:10:23.689 --> 04:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
the morning the next day there are many
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
districts that are made up of multiple
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
towns I think the largest is 16 towns so
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
we accumulate all those information we
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know until that point that
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a ranked Choice
 
04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
voting runoff in effect for that
 
04:10:42.120 --> 04:10:43.550 align:start position:0%
voting runoff in effect for that
election

04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
on Election night people mentioned
 
04:10:48.290 --> 04:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
earlier about the couriers who bring
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
information to us those couriers are our
 
04:10:55.130 --> 04:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
state police they are bringing to us a
 
04:10:58.490 --> 04:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
iPad from each town which was used for
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
the one for all system and a one-page
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
return of votes the state police would
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to put all of the
 
04:11:10.010 --> 04:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
ballots from each of the towns that
 
04:11:12.349 --> 04:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
they're transporting that information to
 
04:11:15.769 --> 04:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
us in their Cruisers
 
04:11:19.610 --> 04:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh once you've once you know which towns
 
04:11:22.010 --> 04:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
are which races are going to have
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
um ranked Choice voting those ballots
 
04:11:27.290 --> 04:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
would need to be transported to Concord
 
04:11:29.450 --> 04:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that the plans would be
 
04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
that you'd be using a high-speed scanner
 
04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
we are already doing high-speed scans
 
04:11:36.290 --> 04:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
something that was passed last year for
 
04:11:38.170 --> 04:11:38.180 align:start position:0%
post-election audits
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
in November we did four it took the
 
04:11:43.370 --> 04:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
better part of a of a day to do the
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanning for the four towns
 
04:11:47.570 --> 04:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
that were selected
 
04:11:50.150 --> 04:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think that if we were to have
 
04:11:52.610 --> 04:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting you would probably
 
04:11:55.370 --> 04:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
need to move off the date
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
that someone gets to request a recount
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
right now the election is on Tuesday you
 
04:12:03.650 --> 04:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
have until 5 PM on Friday to request a
 
04:12:06.610 --> 04:12:06.620 align:start position:0%
recount if we have to go through the
 
04:12:09.290 --> 04:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting procedure I think
 
04:12:11.710 --> 04:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
you would probably have to move that off
 
04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
which it's sort of a domino effect we'll
 
04:12:16.969 --> 04:12:16.979 align:start position:0%
continue to move other other dates off
 
04:12:20.510 --> 04:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
if there is ranked Choice voting in New
 
04:12:23.889 --> 04:12:23.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any recounts
 
04:12:27.410 --> 04:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
are done manually you're not allowed to
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
use a high speed scanner obviously you
 
04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
can change those laws but right now all
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
recounts are done by hand so if we if
 
04:12:35.399 --> 04:12:36.710 align:start position:0%
recounts are done by hand so if we if
after

04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:12:38.090 --> 04:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
you've gone through this right choice
 
04:12:41.330 --> 04:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
voting one of the candidates requests a
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
recount we would be doing a recount by
 
04:12:47.450 --> 04:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
hand and also doing the ranked Choice
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
voting by hand so these are other issues
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
that you need to think of if you were to
 
04:12:55.210 --> 04:12:55.220 align:start position:0%
go forward with these bills
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
my biggest concern is the uakava
 
04:12:58.920 --> 04:12:59.809 align:start position:0%
my biggest concern is the uakava
deadline

04:12:59.809 --> 04:12:59.819 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
04:13:01.849 --> 04:13:01.859 align:start position:0%
as you know we only have eight weeks
 
04:13:03.530 --> 04:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
between our primary and our general
 
04:13:03.540 --> 04:13:04.610 align:start position:0%
between our primary and our general
election

04:13:04.610 --> 04:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
if we are doing the ranked Choice voting
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
and you potentially have to move off the
 
04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
date of that someone can ask for a
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
recount and then we do those recounts by
 
04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
hand and we have to do the ranked Choice
 
04:13:18.769 --> 04:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
voting by hand
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
the date that we are going to know be
 
04:13:24.050 --> 04:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
able to declare who is the winner of the
 
04:13:25.370 --> 04:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
primary we'll go on to the general
 
04:13:25.380 --> 04:13:26.570 align:start position:0%
primary we'll go on to the general
election

04:13:26.570 --> 04:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
we would not have enough time
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
to electronically prepare those ballots
 
04:13:35.330 --> 04:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
so that they can be sent off in the
 
04:13:38.929 --> 04:13:38.939 align:start position:0%
45-day euacaba deadline there is no you
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
will cover deadline related to Municipal
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
elections So This only affects the um
 
04:13:46.010 --> 04:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
the federal election you know if we are
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
talking in terms of a U.S Senate or a
 
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
person Nation primary you were talking
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
about all the ballots in the state
 
04:13:58.849 --> 04:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
coming to to Concord
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
um I suggested that would probably be a
 
04:14:06.170 --> 04:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
reasonably lengthy process the the
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State wants to go on record
 
04:14:10.550 --> 04:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
that he is against any
 
04:14:13.969 --> 04:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
um any bills that would make it so that
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
we do not know who the winner is on
 
04:14:19.250 --> 04:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
Election nine especially for the first
 
04:14:29.330 --> 04:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:31.370 --> 04:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me representative
 
04:14:31.380 --> 04:14:32.510 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me representative
wary

04:14:32.510 --> 04:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
wary
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for your testimony uh
 
04:14:37.610 --> 04:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
if there was a recount request would
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
there be a breakdown of for the ranked
 
04:14:42.410 --> 04:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
Choice voting of the different uh
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
runoffs and what they've produced in
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
getting to that uh majority winner I'm
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
sure we would have that information but
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
we are required to do to count each
 
04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
ballot and do it by hand so unless you
 
04:15:00.530 --> 04:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
change the laws to allow recounts to be
 
04:15:02.809 --> 04:15:02.819 align:start position:0%
to use high-speed scanning or something
 
04:15:04.849 --> 04:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
we would still need to even though we
 
04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
know we always know what the results
 
04:15:09.889 --> 04:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
were on Election night but we then have
 
04:15:12.530 --> 04:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
to hand count the ballots
 
04:15:15.769 --> 04:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry maybe uh follow up follow up
 
04:15:18.590 --> 04:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I made my uh question clear
 
04:15:20.809 --> 04:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that is
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
um in the ranked Choice voting process
 
04:15:25.130 --> 04:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
different candidates are eliminated and
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
then uh votes are shifted and and
 
04:15:30.370 --> 04:15:30.380 align:start position:0%
accordingly would those different
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
sequences of counting votes be available
 
04:15:37.370 --> 04:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
as part of the recount process so that
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
there was a kind of transparency as to
 
04:15:42.530 --> 04:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
how different candidates were eliminated
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
and then selected I think that we would
 
04:15:47.210 --> 04:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
need to go through that same that same
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
process of eliminating the lower
 
04:15:52.490 --> 04:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
candidates and then re-looking at who
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
everyone put as their second choice of
 
04:15:58.250 --> 04:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
those uh voters for the candidates that
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
were eliminated I mean unless
 
04:16:02.929 --> 04:16:02.939 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature changes that
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
process that would everything that the
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanner did we would be doing
 
04:16:12.530 --> 04:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.330 --> 04:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative ankenberg can you send me
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
up the blue sheet please thank you
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative Berry
 
04:16:19.849 --> 04:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:16:22.010 --> 04:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad you brought up the first in
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
the nation because I was the one that
 
04:16:25.969 --> 04:16:25.979 align:start position:0%
was sitting on my my head my brain
 
04:16:25.979 --> 04:16:26.630 align:start position:0%
was sitting on my my head my brain
um

04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:30.349 --> 04:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
so a party adopts this
 
04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
and they use this method
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
all the ballots we use paper ballots in
 
04:16:37.370 --> 04:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so all the ballots have to
 
04:16:38.450 --> 04:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
go to Concord
 
04:16:41.150 --> 04:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
it took you a day to do four towns I
 
04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
assumed that you would try to expand
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
that process and assume that
 
04:16:47.210 --> 04:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
um would we have the results by the time
 
04:16:49.010 --> 04:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
the next state was Voting because right
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
now we're a week ahead right by law
 
04:16:53.809 --> 04:16:53.819 align:start position:0%
would we even have our results by the
 
04:16:56.570 --> 04:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
time the next state voted I I can't tell
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
you that for sure I mean obviously we If
 
04:17:01.130 --> 04:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
This Were to to go through and it were
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
going to be for the First Nation primary
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
we would probably have to arrange to
 
04:17:08.150 --> 04:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a lot of high-speed scanners but we
 
04:17:10.750 --> 04:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
need to keep the votes from every town
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
separate and we have 320 voting
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
locations in the state we can't
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
commingle ballots so there's just
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:17:24.050 --> 04:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
um you know an actual process that that
 
04:17:27.170 --> 04:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
follow up going back to the first the
 
04:17:30.769 --> 04:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
nation primary
 
04:17:33.889 --> 04:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
um we the Secretary of State's office uh
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
changes the ballot order right so you
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
like all those ballots aren't even the
 
04:17:38.570 --> 04:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
same so even if you wanted to come
 
04:17:41.150 --> 04:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
England right you couldn't you couldn't
 
04:17:44.650 --> 04:17:44.660 align:start position:0%
um no okay it's it is um
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
various ballot as to who's going to be
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
first on the ballot the order in a
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
primary is different obviously than the
 
04:17:52.150 --> 04:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
general election the general election
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
which which one is um is first and
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
second and uh third in in the columns
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
goes by what Senate District you're in
 
04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
so but a primary is a little bit
 
04:18:03.779 --> 04:18:04.790 align:start position:0%
so but a primary is a little bit
different

04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:18:08.210 --> 04:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
um so the ballot will the ballot at
 
04:18:09.889 --> 04:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
least at the presidential would
 
04:18:11.809 --> 04:18:11.819 align:start position:0%
basically be the same for for each of
 
04:18:13.969 --> 04:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
them but there will be some that are
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
hand count ballots which don't have the
 
04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
same timing marks they're not the same
 
04:18:20.689 --> 04:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
ballot as those that go through the Accu
 
04:18:24.170 --> 04:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
so I guess for just if you were going to
 
04:18:29.450 --> 04:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
go forward with something like this I
 
04:18:31.370 --> 04:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
think you would have to do it in
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
conjunction with moving the data the
 
04:18:32.880 --> 04:18:35.630 align:start position:0%
conjunction with moving the data the
primary

04:18:35.630 --> 04:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.490 --> 04:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
04:18:40.130 --> 04:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:18:43.969 --> 04:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
so uh when we are looking at delays in
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
counting the votes we have a provisional
 
04:18:49.250 --> 04:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
ballot system that prevents us from
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
knowing the actual total a week after
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
the election uh so in terms of counting
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
up all of these uh additional ranked
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
Choice votes that really would not delay
 
04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:10.010 --> 04:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
I mean you have to go through the
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
physical process of doing of scanning
 
04:19:12.840 --> 04:19:14.510 align:start position:0%
physical process of doing of scanning
and

04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
all of those ballots so obviously that's
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
going to delay it you're not going to
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
have your your results that night the
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots which we'll be doing
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
with the first time
 
04:19:26.689 --> 04:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
um next month is only related to
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
first-time voters who don't have their
 
04:19:31.250 --> 04:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
um don't have their information and you
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
would know on Election night that a town
 
04:19:33.600 --> 04:19:34.910 align:start position:0%
would know on Election night that a town
had

04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
six provisional ballots and if there's
 
04:19:40.010 --> 04:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
no race that has a difference of more
 
04:19:43.130 --> 04:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
than six you're not going to have a um
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change your outcome it
 
04:19:48.110 --> 04:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
may change the actual count but it's not
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:51.960 --> 04:19:55.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:19:55.130 --> 04:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.290 --> 04:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for the
 
04:19:58.849 --> 04:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
question taking the question do you know
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
offhand how many of the 320 voting
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
locations um use scanners roughly
 
04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
you scan nobody uses scanners they use
 
04:20:09.410 --> 04:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
the accuvote machines
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I actually have the number back my
 
04:20:14.809 --> 04:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
office uh it's almost half that are by
 
04:20:16.729 --> 04:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
hand but they're they're but of those
 
04:20:21.410 --> 04:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
320. the the ones that do it by um hand
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
count don't amount to 50 of the of the
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
votes by any means
 
04:20:32.330 --> 04:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:35.809 --> 04:20:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
so you might have noticed me Crossing
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
names off of the blue sheet that is
 
04:20:42.290 --> 04:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
because some people
 
04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
send in a pink card speak and then sign
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet you cannot be on both
 
04:20:51.290 --> 04:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
so there were representative churner and
 
04:20:53.929 --> 04:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
Linda Bundy who did speak so I just took
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
them off of this of the remaining
 
04:20:59.630 --> 04:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
by people's five people signed in in
 
04:21:03.110 --> 04:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
favor to against and that concludes the
 
04:22:37.250 --> 04:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:37.260 --> 04:22:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
we will open the public hearing on House
 
04:23:07.729 --> 04:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.530 --> 04:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
honorable members
 
04:23:14.450 --> 04:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to roll straight
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
into uh the next bill which we
 
04:23:20.570 --> 04:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
affectionately termed the big bill
 
04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
um without trying trying to not repeat
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
um things that were previously said on
 
04:23:28.130 --> 04:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
 
04:23:32.210 --> 04:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh the first it's staged
 
04:23:33.769 --> 04:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
implementation there are three stages
 
04:23:35.990 --> 04:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
the first stage is essentially more or
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
less identical to the bill that you just
 
04:23:39.530 --> 04:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
heard where it enables municipalities
 
04:23:41.809 --> 04:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
and parties to run it for their
 
04:23:43.969 --> 04:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections and party primaries
 
04:23:49.010 --> 04:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
that is for becomes uh
 
04:23:51.050 --> 04:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
it is uh
 
04:23:53.090 --> 04:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
in effect is the word I was looking for
 
04:23:56.689 --> 04:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
in effect for the end of this year for
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
next year's primaries
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
um 2024 for the second stage it applies
 
04:24:06.110 --> 04:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
to Federal races that would go into
 
04:24:10.969 --> 04:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
effect for 2025 for the 2026 election
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
um and then the final stage is for all
 
04:24:15.769 --> 04:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
state elections would go into effect
 
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
2027 for the 2028 election
 
04:24:24.650 --> 04:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
um as a previous speaker mentioned the
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
issue of the plurality provision in our
 
04:24:29.710 --> 04:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
constitution does not at all touch
 
04:24:32.090 --> 04:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections it does not at all
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
touch uh primaries it also does not at
 
04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
all touch and could not touch Federal
 
04:24:42.410 --> 04:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
races it only has to do with State races
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is why the state races are the
 
04:24:48.250 --> 04:24:48.260 align:start position:0%
last stage so we have a good five years
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
to pull the plug if there were any
 
04:24:54.170 --> 04:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
problems I will also mention that we do
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
have severability in this state so even
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass and at some point
 
04:25:01.969 --> 04:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
it were to be challenged which I will
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
bring up but I also have a lawyer and an
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
expert that will will speak in more in
 
04:25:10.269 --> 04:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
depth to it why we think it's completely
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional but if it were to be
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
challenged on the first two pieces the
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
first two stages of implementation would
 
04:25:19.610 --> 04:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
remain intact the only piece that's
 
04:25:21.950 --> 04:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
touched by that plurality provision is
 
04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
the last piece again which is why it is
 
04:25:24.300 --> 04:25:25.250 align:start position:0%
the last piece again which is why it is
last

04:25:25.250 --> 04:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
some of the things that didn't really uh
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
have so much of a bearing on the
 
04:25:31.849 --> 04:25:31.859 align:start position:0%
previous bill that are in this bill is
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of multi-winner districts
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
multi-winter districts are like many of
 
04:25:38.929 --> 04:25:38.939 align:start position:0%
our State Rep districts where instead of
 
04:25:41.530 --> 04:25:41.540 align:start position:0%
one winner you have multiple winners
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting when it's done in a
 
04:25:45.889 --> 04:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
multi-member district produces a
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
wonderful effect of proportionality
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
through something that some people refer
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
to as proportional RCV also known as
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
single transferable vote specifically
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
there are different flavors of single
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
transferable vote this bill spells out
 
04:26:00.889 --> 04:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
what is known as the Scottish method and
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
it's known as the Scottish method
 
04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
because the Scots use it
 
04:26:08.450 --> 04:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
um it is vastly superior and in fact in
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
and of itself proportional RCV done in
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts is by itself a
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
good reason to adopt ranked Choice
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
voting because when you have a
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
multi-member district let's say you have
 
04:26:21.889 --> 04:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
a district with seven reps
 
04:26:27.050 --> 04:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
let's say that district is 60 percent uh
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
orange party and 40 percent purple party
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
very frequently what happens is known as
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
a single party sweep all seven of those
 
04:26:40.370 --> 04:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
seats go to the orange party none to the
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
purple party even though 40 percent of
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
that entire District deserves
 
04:26:47.210 --> 04:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
representation and you have the ability
 
04:26:48.769 --> 04:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
to give them some of the representation
 
04:26:52.729 --> 04:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
say three of those seven seats in uh
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
proportional RCV single transferable
 
04:26:56.809 --> 04:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
vote it produces those proportional
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
results so you have that seven member
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
district four would go to the orange
 
04:27:02.929 --> 04:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
party three would go to the purple party
 
04:27:04.729 --> 04:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
in that example
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
just to touch once again on
 
04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
implementation very similar to The
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
implementation discussion earlier it has
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
since it has been implemented in many
 
04:27:14.570 --> 04:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
places we know that it's completely
 
04:27:16.670 --> 04:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
doable we also know that the counting of
 
04:27:18.889 --> 04:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting results is very
 
04:27:22.729 --> 04:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
very very fast the only thing that adds
 
04:27:25.250 --> 04:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
time is the couriering and we already
 
04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
Courier on Election night we already do
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
that the furthest place we so main
 
04:27:32.330 --> 04:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
couriers Maine is a much larger
 
04:27:35.090 --> 04:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
geographical State than we are
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
um the furthest place in this state is
 
04:27:39.410 --> 04:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
about three hours away from Concord so
 
04:27:42.110 --> 04:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
it with handling and whatever you're
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
talking about a four two I would say
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
probably not more than six hour uh Delay
 
04:27:50.030 --> 04:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
from the careering effect
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
um I would also like to talk about the
 
04:27:54.110 --> 04:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
polarization civility as it pertains
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
specifically to this bill
 
04:27:57.239 --> 04:27:58.550 align:start position:0%
specifically to this bill
um

04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
before we were talking about in party
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
primaries but when we're talking about
 
04:28:05.330 --> 04:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
in regular races where we're talking
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
about the two major parties going
 
04:28:10.130 --> 04:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
head-to-head we all know how bad
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
polarization is in fact there's lots and
 
04:28:14.450 --> 04:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
lots of data and I think you actually
 
04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
have some testimonies submitted to you
 
04:28:18.769 --> 04:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
already about the increasing
 
04:28:21.050 --> 04:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
polarization of our country not just in
 
04:28:22.729 --> 04:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
the recent years but over the last many
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
decades and how it's not just a blip and
 
04:28:27.769 --> 04:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
not just a natural ebb and flow of
 
04:28:29.330 --> 04:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
democracy but in fact it has gotten
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
worse and worse because of the two-party
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
effect let me just be very very clear in
 
04:28:36.290 --> 04:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and I teach American
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
government as a part-time job
 
04:28:41.330 --> 04:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
for Community College we do not we are
 
04:28:43.010 --> 04:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
not supposed to have a two-party system
 
04:28:44.570 --> 04:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
that is not in the Constitution anywhere
 
04:28:46.370 --> 04:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
in fact our founding fathers vehemently
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
hated what they called factions what we
 
04:28:50.929 --> 04:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
call parties they hated the idea of
 
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
parties for this very reason two the
 
04:28:56.689 --> 04:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
two-party system as we frequently bemoan
 
04:28:59.809 --> 04:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
it is a result of our first pass the
 
04:29:02.210 --> 04:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
post system and winner take all that is
 
04:29:03.889 --> 04:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
what happens you get forced like I said
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
before the only there's only two
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
candidates that ever matter the one in
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
the top and the one that's best in a
 
04:29:11.389 --> 04:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
position to to oust that person that is
 
04:29:14.030 --> 04:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
why and that is also why the two parties
 
04:29:16.370 --> 04:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
start to become bitter and it's all a
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
scare tactic to make you afraid of them
 
04:29:20.929 --> 04:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter if this party is
 
04:29:22.610 --> 04:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
that great because there's no other real
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
options because we're in the best
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
position one of the previous speakers
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
against the last bill was saying
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of well ranked
 
04:29:31.130 --> 04:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
Choice voting still helps the two
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
parties no it has an even playing field
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
in our current situation the two parties
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
have more funding and so probably would
 
04:29:41.090 --> 04:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
still control and come in top for most
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the elections just from that aspect
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
alone but over time because it isn't
 
04:29:47.689 --> 04:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
even playing field you're allowing
 
04:29:49.370 --> 04:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
independent candidates third party
 
04:29:51.530 --> 04:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
candidates low dollar candidates to all
 
04:29:53.330 --> 04:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
compete on even playing field of ideas
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
ideas only not oh my God I'm so scared I
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
really like this candidate but I'm
 
04:30:00.290 --> 04:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
afraid of voting for them because I'm
 
04:30:02.110 --> 04:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
afraid that the other guy will win
 
04:30:05.689 --> 04:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.729 --> 04:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
that you have some testimony who's been
 
04:30:10.130 --> 04:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
submitted to you from Amy Smith who is a
 
04:30:12.189 --> 04:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
main register of Voters
 
04:30:15.649 --> 04:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
she also 30 years ago was a scholar of
 
04:30:18.290 --> 04:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
international ethnic conflict and she
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
writes in her testimony that the low
 
04:30:22.969 --> 04:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
plurality winners and first pass the
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
post systems in the countries that she
 
04:30:27.889 --> 04:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
was studying exacerbated the distrust
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
the unrest and the violence in those
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
countries built between the political
 
04:30:34.849 --> 04:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
factions because the winners were not
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
seen as valid that has to ring a bell
 
04:30:38.809 --> 04:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
for some of you the winners were not
 
04:30:40.729 --> 04:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
seen as valid and I don't care if it's
 
04:30:41.929 --> 04:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
the last election cycle or the one
 
04:30:43.969 --> 04:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
before that or the one before that we or
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
hearing this increasingly no matter who
 
04:30:46.439 --> 04:30:48.410 align:start position:0%
hearing this increasingly no matter who
wins

04:30:48.410 --> 04:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
wins
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
she then goes on to write but 30 years
 
04:30:53.570 --> 04:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
ago mind you
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
she witnessed that in Bosnia Estonia Sri
 
04:31:01.610 --> 04:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
Lanka and Ireland they all successfully
 
04:31:03.769 --> 04:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
implemented ranked Choice voting and
 
04:31:06.410 --> 04:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
then successfully decreased the unrest
 
04:31:09.170 --> 04:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
because winners were seen as having
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
actual broad support
 
04:31:14.210 --> 04:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
that is significant and it's significant
 
04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
for a reason I also talked to my
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
children my children my kids my two
 
04:31:18.849 --> 04:31:18.859 align:start position:0%
students about
 
04:31:22.250 --> 04:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
because it turns out psychologically
 
04:31:25.010 --> 04:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
people accept results when they believe
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
the system is fair when they think it's
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
fair and it's done correctly they accept
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
when their guy doesn't win
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
because hey that's just how it goes it's
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
only when they think it's unfair that
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
you end up with the Civil rest and the
 
04:31:41.210 --> 04:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
bitterness and the hatred that we're
 
04:31:41.220 --> 04:31:44.330 align:start position:0%
bitterness and the hatred that we're
experiencing

04:31:44.330 --> 04:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:47.469 --> 04:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
on to the plurality uh issue
 
04:31:50.570 --> 04:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
so our constitution like I said was
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
amended because of that political gaming
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the majority requirement and running
 
04:31:57.769 --> 04:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
people to spoil the other party in the
 
04:32:00.130 --> 04:32:00.140 align:start position:0%
legislature determining outcomes
 
04:32:02.929 --> 04:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
our plurality provision applies to a
 
04:32:05.090 --> 04:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
number of State offices however ranked
 
04:32:06.590 --> 04:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
Choice voting is the method for
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
determining plurality as I said not all
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
and it's defined in the bill not all
 
04:32:15.290 --> 04:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh ranked respawning winners end up with
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
a plurality because if voters do not
 
04:32:21.110 --> 04:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
exhaust all their preferences then the
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
person who wins may not have 50 of the
 
04:32:23.580 --> 04:32:24.410 align:start position:0%
person who wins may not have 50 of the
vote

04:32:24.410 --> 04:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:32:26.330 --> 04:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
and indeed a multi-member districts none
 
04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
of them have or many of them will not
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
have 50 of the vote inherently so we do
 
04:32:34.370 --> 04:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
not have a requirement for majority you
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
get more frequent majority winners
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
because we're finding the best possible
 
04:32:39.479 --> 04:32:42.290 align:start position:0%
because we're finding the best possible
plurality

04:32:42.290 --> 04:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
plurality
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I will wrap up by briefly talking
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
about the concept of alternative systems
 
04:32:51.769 --> 04:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
that was brought up before so arrows
 
04:32:55.370 --> 04:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
theorem uh is a election theory that
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
actually the the Creator uh Dr Arrow won
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
the Nobel Prize for in it he lists four
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
fairness principles for any election
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
system and he proved mathematically that
 
04:33:10.670 --> 04:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
there is no system in existence that can
 
04:33:13.131 --> 04:33:13.141 align:start position:0%
meet all four there are systems that do
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
not meet three but there's no system
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
that meets all four ranked Choice voting
 
04:33:19.131 --> 04:33:19.141 align:start position:0%
meets three
 
04:33:23.449 --> 04:33:23.459 align:start position:0%
um and it is not just in many ways the
 
04:33:25.369 --> 04:33:25.379 align:start position:0%
best of all the alternative systems it
 
04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
is definitely the only alternative
 
04:33:29.209 --> 04:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
system that has real world data real
 
04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
world use for over a hundred years I
 
04:33:34.849 --> 04:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
might add in as I said a dozen countries
 
04:33:37.490 --> 04:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
or so 20-something states on the local
 
04:33:40.189 --> 04:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
level also used for overseas and
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
Military ballots and State that do run
 
04:33:44.209 --> 04:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
off elections so if you have a runoff
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
election but you're overseas those
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
States like Georgia they send you a
 
04:33:51.769 --> 04:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
ballot that's ranked Choice voting in
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
essence because you don't have time as
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
an overseas voter to engage in a runoff
 
04:33:59.090 --> 04:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
election so they let you go ahead and
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
say who would you vote for if it does go
 
04:34:02.810 --> 04:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
to runoff that's rank Choice voting
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's all it is
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
so um it's been done for 100 years in
 
04:34:09.949 --> 04:34:09.959 align:start position:0%
many many locations and I will finally
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
add that in case anybody still thinks
 
04:34:14.051 --> 04:34:14.061 align:start position:0%
that it's a partisan thing or
 
04:34:18.131 --> 04:34:18.141 align:start position:0%
people support it because maybe certain
 
04:34:21.289 --> 04:34:21.299 align:start position:0%
ideologies are it benefits or certain
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
ideologies I will say that not only as
 
04:34:27.070 --> 04:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
was mentioned the Virginia GOP
 
04:34:29.810 --> 04:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
instituted and actually ended up with an
 
04:34:32.330 --> 04:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
upset over the Democratic candidate for
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
governor by their candidate was selected
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
by ranked Choice voting the Utah GOP has
 
04:34:39.650 --> 04:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
used it for over 20 years the
 
04:34:41.330 --> 04:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
libertarian party has used it for over
 
04:34:43.849 --> 04:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
20 years internally Australia which
 
04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
we've talked about frequently that's
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
used over 100 years famously elects far
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
more conservatives than any other
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
Western democracy western style
 
04:34:54.769 --> 04:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
democracy with maybe the exception of
 
04:34:57.529 --> 04:34:57.539 align:start position:0%
the United States it's it doesn't pick
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
ideologies look through the bill you
 
04:35:01.490 --> 04:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
can't pick anything that's an ideology
 
04:35:04.490 --> 04:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
in that bill it's all about what it
 
04:35:06.650 --> 04:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
represents so it doesn't give preferred
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
treatment to conservatives liberals
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
Independents or anybody else it does
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
give preferred treatment to the truth so
 
04:35:14.209 --> 04:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
if you have a rural country like
 
04:35:15.890 --> 04:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
Australia it's probably going to come
 
04:35:18.170 --> 04:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
out like a conservative election right
 
04:35:21.170 --> 04:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
but if you have a populist that is
 
04:35:23.570 --> 04:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
leaning to the left in election that's
 
04:35:25.609 --> 04:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
probably what you're going to get
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
so um with that I'll happily take
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
questions and let the experts kind of
 
04:35:39.970 --> 04:35:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:35:45.051 --> 04:35:45.061 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
 
04:35:45.061 --> 04:35:47.929 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
question

04:35:47.929 --> 04:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:50.929 --> 04:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
um so how feasible is a manual audit in
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting election I ask
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
because one voter has written that she
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
is opposed to rank Choice voting because
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
she believes hand counted audits would
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
be difficult
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
she says that due to the quote threats
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
of hacking and rigging and the lack of
 
04:36:10.010 --> 04:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
confidence in our voting machines
 
04:36:10.020 --> 04:36:11.209 align:start position:0%
confidence in our voting machines
unquote

04:36:11.209 --> 04:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
that there is a critical need for manual
 
04:36:13.320 --> 04:36:14.449 align:start position:0%
that there is a critical need for manual
auditing

04:36:14.449 --> 04:36:14.459 align:start position:0%
auditing
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
over this past summer representative
 
04:36:16.439 --> 04:36:18.189 align:start position:0%
over this past summer representative
that's

04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:36:21.170 --> 04:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
we're asking questions that's a lot of
 
04:36:23.810 --> 04:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
testimony being read in so I think I
 
04:36:25.369 --> 04:36:25.379 align:start position:0%
kind of we probably understood your
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
question and we can go from there I mean
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you stopping the testimony
 
04:36:31.131 --> 04:36:31.141 align:start position:0%
against my bill Mr chairman the
 
04:36:32.330 --> 04:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
testimony she was reading not the
 
04:36:34.609 --> 04:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
testimony she was giving but I
 
04:36:36.650 --> 04:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
understand the question yeah manual
 
04:36:36.660 --> 04:36:37.849 align:start position:0%
understand the question yeah manual
audits

04:36:37.849 --> 04:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
audits
 
04:36:40.429 --> 04:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
um extremely doable by hand I've done
 
04:36:43.131 --> 04:36:43.141 align:start position:0%
probably close to two dozen ranked
 
04:36:45.529 --> 04:36:45.539 align:start position:0%
Choice voting elections ranging in 102
 
04:36:49.250 --> 04:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
close to 400 votes by hand in public for
 
04:36:52.490 --> 04:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
people to see then with usually my
 
04:36:55.490 --> 04:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
colleague behind me doing it again to
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
double check the numbers all usually
 
04:37:00.890 --> 04:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
within about an hour the method of
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
choice when doing because again there's
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
best best practices for all of this
 
04:37:07.369 --> 04:37:07.379 align:start position:0%
because this is all very well trodden
 
04:37:09.650 --> 04:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
paths a hundred years of countries and
 
04:37:11.330 --> 04:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
states and cities and organizations
 
04:37:14.090 --> 04:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
doing this well trodden the best
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
practice for doing it by hand is called
 
04:37:17.689 --> 04:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
stack and sort the stack and sort method
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
sound is exactly what it sounds like
 
04:37:22.250 --> 04:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's stacking and sorting you sort them
 
04:37:23.929 --> 04:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
out by the first preference you take the
 
04:37:25.849 --> 04:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
smallest stack and then if you don't
 
04:37:27.529 --> 04:37:27.539 align:start position:0%
have a winner you reallocate this the
 
04:37:30.769 --> 04:37:30.779 align:start position:0%
shortest stack it takes a little extra
 
04:37:32.689 --> 04:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
time than counting by hand in a
 
04:37:35.449 --> 04:37:35.459 align:start position:0%
conventional election a little maybe up
 
04:37:36.830 --> 04:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
to about fifty percent and the reason
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
it's so little extra is because you're
 
04:37:40.849 --> 04:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
not dealing with all of those ballots
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with the shortest Stacks
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
the eliminated Stacks which are pretty
 
04:37:47.689 --> 04:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
short and small so those are the only
 
04:37:49.970 --> 04:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
ballots you touch more than once and
 
04:37:52.131 --> 04:37:52.141 align:start position:0%
because of that it only takes a little
 
04:37:53.689 --> 04:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
bit more time than counting a normal
 
04:37:55.369 --> 04:37:55.379 align:start position:0%
Race by hand which is one of the reasons
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
I think that some of the objections that
 
04:37:59.810 --> 04:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
or concerns that the Secretary of
 
04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
State's office has expressed are
 
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
actually not founded and not based in
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative where
 
04:38:13.131 --> 04:38:13.141 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh representative we
 
04:38:16.250 --> 04:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your uh testimony there
 
04:38:16.260 --> 04:38:16.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for your uh testimony there
um

04:38:16.990 --> 04:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
in Australia policy has talked about
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
that over the long term
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
in using ranked Choice voting it's led
 
04:38:27.410 --> 04:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
to a predominant two-party system with
 
04:38:31.010 --> 04:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
detriments to minority voters and
 
04:38:33.470 --> 04:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
independents do you think the bill has
 
04:38:36.170 --> 04:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
written would prevent that sort of thing
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
happening within
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if you if you're asking if
 
04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think that right choice voting as a
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
reform on its own is a Panacea a silver
 
04:38:50.449 --> 04:38:50.459 align:start position:0%
bullet for all ills then the answer is
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
no of course not but I think it's a
 
04:38:54.529 --> 04:38:54.539 align:start position:0%
major major
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
um reform that goes a very very long way
 
04:39:00.051 --> 04:39:00.061 align:start position:0%
towards fixing a lot of problems
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
including these so not the parties
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
themselves it doesn't ban the two
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
parties and it doesn't take away their
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
money so they still have a lot of clout
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
and power but it allows an even playing
 
04:39:14.810 --> 04:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
field which can at least provide room
 
04:39:16.429 --> 04:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
for other parties and other candidates
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
so in that aspect it is very beneficial
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
helps just release the Stranglehold the
 
04:39:25.609 --> 04:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
two parties have on the system but it
 
04:39:27.769 --> 04:39:27.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee the wonderful robust
 
04:39:29.570 --> 04:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
democracy that we would all like to see
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.440 --> 04:40:08.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:40:08.810 --> 04:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to election law Mr Myers okay
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
well it's my second try
 
04:40:14.400 --> 04:40:15.530 align:start position:0%
well it's my second try
okay

04:40:15.530 --> 04:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:18.170 --> 04:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to focus on you know the
 
04:40:22.610 --> 04:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
part of the 350 that focuses on the
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives where we have
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts now if two if I
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
looked at the 220 election you will find
 
04:40:34.490 --> 04:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
that of the 99 multi-member districts 81
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
of them had representatives from a
 
04:40:38.630 --> 04:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
single party
 
04:40:42.770 --> 04:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
I think 41 were Democrats and 40 were
 
04:40:42.780 --> 04:40:44.090 align:start position:0%
I think 41 were Democrats and 40 were
Republicans

04:40:44.090 --> 04:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
Republicans
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
now what I want to do is illustrate what
 
04:40:49.010 --> 04:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
happens when you have ranked Choice
 
04:40:51.890 --> 04:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
voting with multi-member districts now
 
04:40:54.170 --> 04:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
I'm created I think an artificial
 
04:40:56.930 --> 04:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
example but I think it will I think draw
 
04:40:59.810 --> 04:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
home the point as to how this works
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I have three candidates from what we
 
04:41:05.208 --> 04:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
call the a party and three candidates
 
04:41:07.610 --> 04:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
from the B party and if you flip over to
 
04:41:11.810 --> 04:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
the opposite side of the handout I gave
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
um if you take a look at the round 1A in
 
04:41:17.090 --> 04:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
the upper left-hand corner
 
04:41:18.890 --> 04:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
you will see the way I set up this
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
election is that the three candidates
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
from the a party won you know they had
 
04:41:26.570 --> 04:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
the most votes
 
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
okay and then what happens is when you
 
04:41:31.850 --> 04:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
go into ranked Choice voting okay they
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
04:41:36.410 --> 04:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
um party the the least number of votes
 
04:41:39.170 --> 04:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
from the B party in this case it's what
 
04:41:40.490 --> 04:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
I call the Tiger
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
and what happens then is the tiger
 
04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
transfer his votes to the other two
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
members of the B party
 
04:41:51.650 --> 04:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
that if you take a look at the right
 
04:41:53.208 --> 04:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
hand side
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
of um you know round 1B there you will
 
04:41:59.448 --> 04:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
see that now the B party candidates have
 
04:42:01.970 --> 04:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
the most votes but they are not quite up
 
04:42:04.850 --> 04:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
to the threshold for
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
um to get elected so then what they do
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
is we now eliminate the lowest vote
 
04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
count from the a party
 
04:42:16.250 --> 04:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
and you can see right away what happens
 
04:42:20.330 --> 04:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
here is that the A party's only going to
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
get at most two candidates
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
okay and then you know what happens is
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
that the smallest one from the a party
 
04:42:32.570 --> 04:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
basically transfers his boats to the
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
other members of the a party and that
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
pushes them over the threshold to get
 
04:42:39.288 --> 04:42:39.298 align:start position:0%
elected and that leaves just simply one
 
04:42:41.570 --> 04:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
seat to be filled with two b-party
 
04:42:43.850 --> 04:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
candidates to be filled
 
04:42:47.208 --> 04:42:47.218 align:start position:0%
okay so um what this does then it shows
 
04:42:49.970 --> 04:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
you how ranked Choice voting actually
 
04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
contributes to
 
04:42:52.378 --> 04:42:52.930 align:start position:0%
contributes to
um

04:42:52.930 --> 04:42:52.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:55.250 --> 04:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
contributes to
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
um proportionality and in general what
 
04:43:00.350 --> 04:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to see is that ranked Choice
 
04:43:02.448 --> 04:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
voting splits the number of seats by
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
party in proportion to the number of
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
party votes
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
and now
 
04:43:09.410 --> 04:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
um what I tried right here is to see
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we were to
 
04:43:11.340 --> 04:43:15.128 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we were to
implement

04:43:15.128 --> 04:43:15.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.050 --> 04:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
Implement ranked Choice voting for the
 
04:43:20.208 --> 04:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
house and I could get went through the
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's website got the
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
vote totals for all of our district all
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
the multi-member districts and what I
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
did is I just basically made the
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
assumption that people would rank only
 
04:43:34.850 --> 04:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
those people in their party
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I it's a simulated election in the
 
04:43:40.610 --> 04:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
real ones would be probably different in
 
04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
the candidates that would win these
 
04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
simulated elections but the vote count
 
04:43:47.330 --> 04:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
the seat count is going to be pretty
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
good and so what happened right here is
 
04:43:52.730 --> 04:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
in the simulated election there were
 
04:43:54.288 --> 04:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
only four
 
04:43:59.090 --> 04:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
seats four districts with party sweeps
 
04:44:02.330 --> 04:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
and if this were to be implemented say
 
04:44:06.410 --> 04:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or for the 2024 election the
 
04:44:08.570 --> 04:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
house makeup is going to be very
 
04:44:08.580 --> 04:44:09.830 align:start position:0%
house makeup is going to be very
different

04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to have Republicans from
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
democratic districts and you're going to
 
04:44:16.930 --> 04:44:16.940 align:start position:0%
have Democrats from Republican districts
 
04:44:20.330 --> 04:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
and myself I think that is a very good
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
thing I think that multi-party
 
04:44:24.830 --> 04:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
representing for districts would serve
 
04:44:26.448 --> 04:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
better serve the citizens of New
 
04:44:26.458 --> 04:44:27.410 align:start position:0%
better serve the citizens of New
Hampshire

04:44:27.410 --> 04:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
now rather than use the current
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
districts okay like there's one District
 
04:44:36.770 --> 04:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
I think Hudson Pelham that has 11 to 11
 
04:44:38.208 --> 04:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
member district
 
04:44:41.090 --> 04:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
all are Republicans because that's the
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
way people vote in these things
 
04:44:47.890 --> 04:44:47.900 align:start position:0%
um I would say that we ought to do
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
implement this after we do some
 
04:44:52.910 --> 04:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting and I would suggest we
 
04:44:55.570 --> 04:44:55.580 align:start position:0%
follow what's being
 
04:44:59.090 --> 04:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
proposed in the
 
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
um for the national elections there's
 
04:45:04.730 --> 04:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
votes in Congress that are saying we do
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
this and that you redistrict and you
 
04:45:10.510 --> 04:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
have anywhere between three and five
 
04:45:12.770 --> 04:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
member districts
 
04:45:15.650 --> 04:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
and um that would take some time and
 
04:45:15.660 --> 04:45:16.550 align:start position:0%
and um that would take some time and
also

04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
um for basically Representatives who
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
um are planning on running for a long
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
time they'll give them time to adjust to
 
04:45:29.810 --> 04:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
the new multi-party agenda so I would
 
04:45:29.820 --> 04:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
the new multi-party agenda so I would
say

04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:45:33.470 --> 04:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
um start thinking about this soon so we
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
can implement it by the time we do
 
04:45:37.310 --> 04:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting again
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um any questions from the
 
04:45:39.480 --> 04:45:40.430 align:start position:0%
thank you um any questions from the
committee

04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everyone's looking forward to
 
04:45:44.110 --> 04:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting again
 
04:45:47.090 --> 04:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
I I will say for a statement of fact I
 
04:45:49.310 --> 04:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
am one of the 18 out of 99 who come from
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
a split member seat I got first in case
 
04:45:54.850 --> 04:45:54.860 align:start position:0%
anybody's wondering okay okay
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
all right next uh any questions from the
 
04:45:57.240 --> 04:45:58.670 align:start position:0%
all right next uh any questions from the
committee

04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.050 --> 04:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
hello uh and when I testified in the
 
04:46:20.150 --> 04:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
last bill I just said my name and where
 
04:46:21.890 --> 04:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
I was from Amherst New Hampshire but
 
04:46:23.810 --> 04:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
I've neglected to say that I'm also
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire ranked Choice
 
04:46:28.490 --> 04:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
voting I do represent them as a
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer I did not get paid to do this
 
04:46:32.690 --> 04:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
I did not get paid from them we are a
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
completely volunteer organization all
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
across the board we don't have any paid
 
04:46:38.930 --> 04:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
stuff we have uh
 
04:46:42.410 --> 04:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
thousands of supporters so um there are
 
04:46:43.730 --> 04:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of people here who do support
 
04:46:46.610 --> 04:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting I am also an
 
04:46:48.288 --> 04:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm licensed to practice law
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to let you know about
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
that now as far as this bill goes as it
 
04:46:55.128 --> 04:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
was pointed out
 
04:46:58.550 --> 04:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
um this bill now as opposed to the last
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill that we talked about this bill
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
would now you know have ranked Choice
 
04:47:05.090 --> 04:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
voting between the parties whereas the
 
04:47:07.128 --> 04:47:07.138 align:start position:0%
last bill would have only been relevant
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
in uh primaries and it would only have
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
been relevant in uh Municipal elections
 
04:47:14.090 --> 04:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't have been anything to do
 
04:47:16.850 --> 04:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
with the partisanship involved but this
 
04:47:18.530 --> 04:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
one you know is ranked Choice voting
 
04:47:21.230 --> 04:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
between the parties and once again I
 
04:47:22.910 --> 04:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
would like to point out that it has
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
broad support across many different
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
parties as has been pointed out
 
04:47:27.600 --> 04:47:28.190 align:start position:0%
parties as has been pointed out
um

04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:29.690 --> 04:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
there were a number of states who
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
elected to use ranked show as voting for
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
their uh presidential primaries in 2020
 
04:47:37.128 --> 04:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
on the Democratic side on the Republican
 
04:47:39.288 --> 04:47:39.298 align:start position:0%
side as was pointed out it was used in
 
04:47:40.970 --> 04:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
the Republican
 
04:47:43.250 --> 04:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
um primary in Virginia and um in Utah
 
04:47:45.890 --> 04:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
which is a very Republican state they
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
have every single uh Congressional race
 
04:47:50.330 --> 04:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
and every single
 
04:47:53.570 --> 04:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
I mean every single a federal seat as
 
04:47:55.208 --> 04:47:55.218 align:start position:0%
well as a
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
super majority in the legislature an
 
04:47:59.570 --> 04:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
All-State office Statewide office
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
holders governor and attorney general
 
04:48:03.890 --> 04:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
Etc they're all Republicans so it's a
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
very Republican state they're not using
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
it yet in their Statewide elections but
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know they do use ranked Choice
 
04:48:12.170 --> 04:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
voting as I already pointed out in many
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
many of their cities and they like it
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
and they use it in their own conventions
 
04:48:15.480 --> 04:48:16.730 align:start position:0%
and they use it in their own conventions
so

04:48:16.730 --> 04:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:18.530 --> 04:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
um and the libertarian party uses it and
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
other parties use it as well so right
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
choice voting and Alaska adopted it
 
04:48:24.410 --> 04:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
which is a Republican state so franchise
 
04:48:27.770 --> 04:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
voting you know is a a reform that is
 
04:48:30.350 --> 04:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
supported by both major parties as well
 
04:48:32.448 --> 04:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
as minor parties
 
04:48:34.850 --> 04:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
some people I remember last year some
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
people indicated that one person
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
actually objected to this because they
 
04:48:41.330 --> 04:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
said it would not help third parties and
 
04:48:42.650 --> 04:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
then other people are worried that it's
 
04:48:44.330 --> 04:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
going to help third parties when it
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't help third parties so let me
 
04:48:48.890 --> 04:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
just explain what it does what it does
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
is it like we've already said it gives
 
04:48:52.250 --> 04:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
people an even playing field what it
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
does is it lets people vote for third
 
04:48:55.970 --> 04:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
parties if they really want to whereas
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
right now sometimes they don't feel like
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
they can it does not mean that it's
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
suddenly make third parties win
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
elections in New Hampshire
 
04:49:08.448 --> 04:49:08.458 align:start position:0%
most likely you know they won't win at
 
04:49:10.730 --> 04:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
first for a while it might take time but
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe down the road they'll start
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
winning elections because the playing
 
04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
field has been more even but even though
 
04:49:18.170 --> 04:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
they may not win immediately what it
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
does do as I already mentioned is it
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
lets them have a better voice because it
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
let as was asked in one of the previous
 
04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions is whether the data would be
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know transparent yes ranked Choice
 
04:49:32.570 --> 04:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
voting always produces very transparent
 
04:49:34.610 --> 04:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
data there was someone who testified
 
04:49:37.550 --> 04:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
last year who actually showed you know
 
04:49:39.850 --> 04:49:39.860 align:start position:0%
the cast vote record from Maine
 
04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
where you can see you know
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
where the votes went
 
04:49:49.128 --> 04:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
so each each vote for each person you
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
see where they went to each candidate
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
and so you're able to see very very
 
04:49:54.890 --> 04:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
clearly you start to realize wait a
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
minute maybe maybe people are more
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
nuanced than we thought maybe people
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
aren't so partisan as we think right now
 
04:50:02.930 --> 04:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
we just assume everyone's partisan
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
because all the elections are very
 
04:50:06.410 --> 04:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
partisan one versus the other all the
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
time but when you actually look at a
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
Casper record you might see that you
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
know maybe the Republican maybe the
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
Libertarians don't always go for the
 
04:50:17.448 --> 04:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
Republican or maybe they do maybe the
 
04:50:19.010 --> 04:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
green party doesn't always go for the
 
04:50:20.750 --> 04:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
Democrat or maybe they do but the point
 
04:50:22.850 --> 04:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
is is that is that it's it's more
 
04:50:25.070 --> 04:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
nuanced because people often do vote for
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
the person over the party
 
04:50:29.090 --> 04:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
um but you're able to start that that
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
helps candidates actually realize oh I
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
need to speak to a broader base of
 
04:50:35.930 --> 04:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
Voters maybe not all my voters like my
 
04:50:37.970 --> 04:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
party points so much they actually want
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
to have me address this issue that this
 
04:50:41.690 --> 04:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
guy's addressing because this guy got
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
this many votes and his his second place
 
04:50:45.530 --> 04:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
didn't go to me it went to the other
 
04:50:47.090 --> 04:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
person be because I'm not addressing
 
04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
those issues at all and so it actually
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
helps us have a better system of
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
government where more people are being
 
04:50:56.690 --> 04:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
heard more people are addressing those
 
04:50:56.700 --> 04:50:57.970 align:start position:0%
heard more people are addressing those
issues

04:50:57.970 --> 04:50:57.980 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:51:00.288 --> 04:51:00.298 align:start position:0%
I know that some people are concerned
 
04:51:01.788 --> 04:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
with some of the election results that
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
have happened in a few places such as
 
04:51:06.830 --> 04:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
Maine or Alaska now as far as Alaska
 
04:51:09.470 --> 04:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
goes we'll just quickly get that one
 
04:51:11.090 --> 04:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
over with as it's been pointed out
 
04:51:13.850 --> 04:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
Alaska uses a different system than this
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
bill would would Implement because they
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
have a combined primary rather than
 
04:51:20.810 --> 04:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
separate party primaries and so it's
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
different and the other thing that's
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
different about Alaska is some people
 
04:51:25.310 --> 04:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
might have been upset that Sarah Palin
 
04:51:26.350 --> 04:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
didn't win
 
04:51:26.360 --> 04:51:28.270 align:start position:0%
didn't win
ultimately

04:51:28.270 --> 04:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
04:51:31.490 --> 04:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
but if it were a regular election she
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have won either in that
 
04:51:34.128 --> 04:51:34.138 align:start position:0%
election because she was not the first
 
04:51:36.288 --> 04:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
place winner the first place winner was
 
04:51:39.530 --> 04:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
patola in Alaska and so had it used our
 
04:51:41.448 --> 04:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
current system patola would have won and
 
04:51:43.010 --> 04:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
in the ranked Choice voting patola won
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
so she would have won in either system
 
04:51:46.550 --> 04:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
so Sarah Palin's losing wasn't really
 
04:51:49.490 --> 04:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
because of ranked Choice voting
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
um some people have complained about
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
what happened in Maine so we'll talk
 
04:51:54.650 --> 04:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
about that really quick
 
04:51:56.810 --> 04:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
um this is talking about the election in
 
04:52:00.530 --> 04:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
2018 between Jared golden and Bruce
 
04:52:00.540 --> 04:52:01.788 align:start position:0%
2018 between Jared golden and Bruce
poliquin

04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
poliquin
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
in that race uh golden
 
04:52:07.128 --> 04:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
came in second after they counted
 
04:52:09.288 --> 04:52:09.298 align:start position:0%
everyone's First Choice votes and after
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
and then when they ran but nobody got a
 
04:52:14.990 --> 04:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
majority and after they ran the election
 
04:52:17.090 --> 04:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
um it turned out that in the end uh
 
04:52:20.208 --> 04:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
um in that race there were two
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
independent candidates who had a lot of
 
04:52:23.760 --> 04:52:24.948 align:start position:0%
independent candidates who had a lot of
support

04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
and you know for for as far as
 
04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
independent candidates go I think it was
 
04:52:31.490 --> 04:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
like a total of 14 of the total vote
 
04:52:32.810 --> 04:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
that they got which is quite a bit
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
usually for an independent candidate and
 
04:52:37.250 --> 04:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
Paula Quinn didn't reach out to those
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
independent voters at all whereas golden
 
04:52:38.878 --> 04:52:40.190 align:start position:0%
independent voters at all whereas golden
did

04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
um paulikan told his voters not to rank
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
anyone second all of that
 
04:52:46.730 --> 04:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
um golden did all of those kinds of
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
things and so in the end you know the
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
the third party candidates preferred
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
golden over poloquin but they could have
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
very easily preferred
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
call it Quinn over golden and in a lot
 
04:53:01.010 --> 04:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
of other races were Ranger studying
 
04:53:03.170 --> 04:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
Choice voting takes place the opposite
 
04:53:06.530 --> 04:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
happens so the point is that a ranked
 
04:53:08.570 --> 04:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
Choice voting election ultimately
 
04:53:10.730 --> 04:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
decides the person who has the most
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
overall voter support
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
it is not favor one party over the other
 
04:53:17.628 --> 04:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
it really favors whoever the voters want
 
04:53:19.128 --> 04:53:19.138 align:start position:0%
and in some elections the voters are
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to want a republican some
 
04:53:22.610 --> 04:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
elections the voters are going to want a
 
04:53:22.620 --> 04:53:23.628 align:start position:0%
elections the voters are going to want a
Democrat

04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
Democrat
 
04:53:25.310 --> 04:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
um ranked Choice voting in and of itself
 
04:53:28.610 --> 04:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
does not favor one party over the other
 
04:53:32.208 --> 04:53:32.218 align:start position:0%
um I I gave in my slides some examples
 
04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
because ranked Choice voting has three
 
04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
different kinds of examples that happen
 
04:53:38.930 --> 04:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
every day in some exam and many many in
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
fact the vast majority of examples of A
 
04:53:42.288 --> 04:53:42.298 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting election
 
04:53:44.810 --> 04:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
somebody wins after the first round of
 
04:53:44.820 --> 04:53:46.368 align:start position:0%
somebody wins after the first round of
counting

04:53:46.368 --> 04:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
counting
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
um because they they get 50 and that
 
04:53:51.170 --> 04:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
means that nobody else can get more than
 
04:53:53.448 --> 04:53:53.458 align:start position:0%
that even if they run all the rounds no
 
04:53:54.650 --> 04:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
one's going to pass them up because they
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
already have 50 more than 50 percent and
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
so a lot of people will be will win that
 
04:54:02.208 --> 04:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
very first round of counting and they
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
won't have to run any more rounds
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
because they win on that first round
 
04:54:07.730 --> 04:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
there's also the example where someone
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
is ahead in the first round
 
04:54:13.310 --> 04:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
but they don't get more than 50 so they
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
keep running the rounds and in the end
 
04:54:18.170 --> 04:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
they still win even though they ran the
 
04:54:19.368 --> 04:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
other rounds it's not like they suddenly
 
04:54:21.708 --> 04:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
the first person of suddenly lost they
 
04:54:24.050 --> 04:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
can still win so some people might think
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
they'll rank towards voting is where the
 
04:54:27.288 --> 04:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
winner ends up losing no the winner
 
04:54:29.208 --> 04:54:29.218 align:start position:0%
often ends up winning in fact
 
04:54:31.128 --> 04:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
more elections end up that way where the
 
04:54:33.410 --> 04:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
person who's first still stays ahead and
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
wins so it's only you know some of those
 
04:54:38.510 --> 04:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
elections where there is a vote a clear
 
04:54:40.670 --> 04:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
vote split that shouldn't exist and
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
where those voters really do prefer the
 
04:54:44.810 --> 04:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
other person that's where you actually
 
04:54:46.490 --> 04:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
have the person in second or third
 
04:54:48.288 --> 04:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
ending up winning after the ranked
 
04:54:48.298 --> 04:54:49.490 align:start position:0%
ending up winning after the ranked
Choice

04:54:49.490 --> 04:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
Choice
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
um elections take it takes place
 
04:54:54.350 --> 04:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I just want to answer a couple of
 
04:54:56.810 --> 04:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
things that have been brought up really
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
quickly as someone brought up that
 
04:55:00.530 --> 04:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
Burlington Vermont stopped using rain
 
04:55:02.330 --> 04:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
Choice voting well they're using it
 
04:55:04.850 --> 04:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
again so they are using it again
 
04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
um as far I think representative Reid
 
04:55:12.410 --> 04:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
already addressed the issue of other
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
methods of voting but yes ranked Choice
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
voting is the best method if anyone
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
wants to talk to us about all the
 
04:55:20.448 --> 04:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
different methods as she said it's not
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
perfect but overall there it checks more
 
04:55:24.650 --> 04:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
boxes than the other methods and overall
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
is the best is the best method of of the
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
methods that are out there
 
04:55:30.420 --> 04:55:32.030 align:start position:0%
methods that are out there
um

04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
as far as someone has been mentioned
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
that hand count towns I mean that if you
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
do a recount it's going to take so much
 
04:55:39.000 --> 04:55:39.890 align:start position:0%
do a recount it's going to take so much
longer

04:55:39.890 --> 04:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
longer
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
once again if you have to do a hand
 
04:55:41.760 --> 04:55:43.070 align:start position:0%
once again if you have to do a hand
recount

04:55:43.070 --> 04:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
recount
 
04:55:44.930 --> 04:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
or if you have to count everything by
 
04:55:47.090 --> 04:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
hand in general it's always going to
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
take longer than if you use you know the
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
accuvote machines or any other kind of
 
04:55:54.170 --> 04:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
voting machine so the ranked Choice
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
voting part of it is only going to add a
 
04:55:58.128 --> 04:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
little bit more to that so yes a hand
 
04:55:59.390 --> 04:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
count takes longer than the machine
 
04:56:01.250 --> 04:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
count that's that's a given hand count
 
04:56:04.730 --> 04:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
takes longer than machine count but
 
04:56:06.770 --> 04:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
um doing the ranked Choice voting if a
 
04:56:08.570 --> 04:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
hand count is just that much longer than
 
04:56:11.690 --> 04:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
a hand count so it's it's not a ranked
 
04:56:13.610 --> 04:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
Choice voting hand count isn't that much
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
longer than the machine count Cambridge
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has always been doing
 
04:56:19.010 --> 04:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
their ranked Choice votings purely by
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
hand count
 
04:56:20.638 --> 04:56:21.350 align:start position:0%
hand count
um

04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:23.810 --> 04:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
as far and once again
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
um you know all of the machines on the
 
04:56:28.010 --> 04:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
market right now for voting
 
04:56:31.128 --> 04:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
have RCV compatible files
 
04:56:33.288 --> 04:56:33.298 align:start position:0%
have the capacity for the RCV compatible
 
04:56:37.128 --> 04:56:37.138 align:start position:0%
files and we know that you know we just
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
they just released the voter confidence
 
04:56:40.970 --> 04:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
committee asking you know saying that we
 
04:56:42.410 --> 04:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
need new machines I think it's pretty
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
much everyone knows we need new machines
 
04:56:46.128 --> 04:56:46.138 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so although ranked
 
04:56:48.288 --> 04:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
Choice voting can take place without
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
machines you know it would be better if
 
04:56:53.448 --> 04:56:53.458 align:start position:0%
we did have the machines
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and so we need we do need to get
 
04:56:56.810 --> 04:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
those new machines and we do need to
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
allocate have a funds towards having
 
04:56:59.810 --> 04:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
machines that's something that we need
 
04:57:01.490 --> 04:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
with or without ranked Choice voting we
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
need new voting machines so that would
 
04:57:05.570 --> 04:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
be faster and more efficient and as was
 
04:57:08.570 --> 04:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier in Maine once they
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
actually get all the ballots or all of
 
04:57:14.448 --> 04:57:14.458 align:start position:0%
the duplicate drives of
 
04:57:16.730 --> 04:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
um they are able to run those ranked
 
04:57:19.850 --> 04:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
Choice voting really fast and it's fully
 
04:57:21.410 --> 04:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
transparent they did it in the open they
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
did it live on Facebook everyone could
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
watch it they also let people come and
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
watch it
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
um they it was very very quick and
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
everyone can see exactly what happened
 
04:57:32.208 --> 04:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
they understand stand exactly where the
 
04:57:34.850 --> 04:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
votes went exactly how it's very easy to
 
04:57:37.610 --> 04:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
understand so it's not at all confusing
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's not at all something where people
 
04:57:39.948 --> 04:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
are like I don't know what happened I
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
don't understand this person won and I
 
04:57:42.530 --> 04:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
don't know why that's that's not at all
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
it happens people know exactly and
 
04:57:46.670 --> 04:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
understand it perfectly so I don't think
 
04:57:48.830 --> 04:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's really anything else
 
04:57:50.810 --> 04:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
I need to point out except for this
 
04:57:53.570 --> 04:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
constitutionality issue that has come
 
04:57:55.010 --> 04:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
out because I am an attorney and I have
 
04:57:56.930 --> 04:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time with this issue so
 
04:57:58.610 --> 04:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
as was already mentioned
 
04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
um there's no issue whatsoever with the
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
other bill on this bill it's there's
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
only a an issue when I say issue I mean
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
it's only a potential issue with regards
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
to the state races so it's not an issue
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
at all with regards to Federal races in
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
regards to ranked Choice voting
 
04:58:19.010 --> 04:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
elections for president for U.S Congress
 
04:58:20.810 --> 04:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
for U.S Senate it's not issue at all for
 
04:58:22.730 --> 04:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
primary or general and it's no issue at
 
04:58:24.890 --> 04:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
all for primary elections for any races
 
04:58:28.010 --> 04:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
so only for races so for general
 
04:58:30.170 --> 04:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
elections for State office that's the
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
only time where even is an issue that
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be discussed
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
as far as whether it needs to be
 
04:58:36.890 --> 04:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
discussed I you probably don't want to
 
04:58:39.948 --> 04:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
hear an entire legal lecture but I can
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
go through it point point by point two
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
things to understand many things to
 
04:58:46.610 --> 04:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
understand but one thing is Although our
 
04:58:48.410 --> 04:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision on plurality is
 
04:58:51.410 --> 04:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
very similar to Maine's constitutional
 
04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
provision on plurality the bill here in
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is different than the
 
04:58:58.990 --> 04:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
language of their
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
ballot measure that they had that
 
04:59:03.410 --> 04:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
implemented ranked Choice voting so in
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
our bill nowhere nowhere does it say
 
04:59:07.550 --> 04:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
that someone has to give a majority to
 
04:59:12.650 --> 04:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
win and also in this bill in HB 350 it
 
04:59:14.330 --> 04:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
says that when when the winner is
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
expressed as a percentage it's expressed
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of total ballots cast
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:59:24.170 --> 04:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
um that would be you know the percentage
 
04:59:25.970 --> 04:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
from the very first round not just the
 
04:59:28.250 --> 04:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
last percentage which means that you
 
04:59:30.050 --> 04:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
know it's not requiring someone to have
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
a majority in order to win someone could
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
win without a majority
 
04:59:36.050 --> 04:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
um if you go through all of the rounds
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
and enough people didn't Express you
 
04:59:40.010 --> 04:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
know their preferences that you know
 
04:59:42.770 --> 04:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
nobody gets a final majority no it will
 
04:59:44.270 --> 04:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
almost always result in the majority and
 
04:59:45.890 --> 04:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing you want elections
 
04:59:48.170 --> 04:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
actually to result majority but it
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to and it's not requiring
 
04:59:51.490 --> 04:59:51.500 align:start position:0%
it and so therefore it would not be
 
04:59:52.910 --> 04:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because we're not
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
requiring someone to have a majority in
 
04:59:55.930 --> 04:59:55.940 align:start position:0%
order to win
 
04:59:58.850 --> 04:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
also as I pointed out and if you care to
 
05:00:00.590 --> 05:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
look there is a law review article that
 
05:00:02.770 --> 05:00:02.780 align:start position:0%
came out in California law review
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
just last year
 
05:00:09.170 --> 05:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
where two professors from NYU do
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
in-depth and depth research where they
 
05:00:13.550 --> 05:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
evaluate every single State's plurality
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
for every single state that has a
 
05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
plurality provision and they're saying
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
that even states that don't say
 
05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
plurality if they say most votes that's
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
also the same thing because that is what
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
plurality means is Whoever has the most
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
votes and they evaluated all of those
 
05:00:29.810 --> 05:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
and they conclude that those provisions
 
05:00:34.730 --> 05:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
and state constitutions do not are not
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
um in conflict with con with
 
05:00:39.288 --> 05:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
not make ranked Choice voting
 
05:00:41.270 --> 05:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in those states that it
 
05:00:43.610 --> 05:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
should still be constitutional so they
 
05:00:45.530 --> 05:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
are they argue very clearly why they
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
think that the main advisory opinion was
 
05:00:49.910 --> 05:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
an incorrect opinion
 
05:00:51.890 --> 05:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
um the main advisory opinion
 
05:00:51.900 --> 05:00:52.730 align:start position:0%
um the main advisory opinion
um

05:00:52.730 --> 05:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
it was only an advisory opinion so it's
 
05:00:58.010 --> 05:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
not it's it's not binding on Maine it
 
05:00:59.810 --> 05:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
was never decided final decision on the
 
05:01:01.850 --> 05:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
merits it's certainly not binding on New
 
05:01:04.850 --> 05:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also you know they don't
 
05:01:07.610 --> 05:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
think it was decided correctly anyway
 
05:01:09.770 --> 05:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and then the main points on that are
 
05:01:11.448 --> 05:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
just that you know in a ranked Choice
 
05:01:13.368 --> 05:01:13.378 align:start position:0%
voting election it's not just it's not
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
saying someone has to win by plurality
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
obviously someone can win by majority
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
people win by majority now and it
 
05:01:20.208 --> 05:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't conflict right is saying by a
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
plurality of the vote meaning they're
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
not requiring a majority right well it's
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
not just the plurality word it's also
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
the vote plurality of the vote and in
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting your vote is your
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
entire ballot when you come you cast a
 
05:01:34.128 --> 05:01:34.138 align:start position:0%
vote your vote is all your rankings all
 
05:01:37.430 --> 05:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
your rankings are your vote and so your
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
entire vote needs to be counted in order
 
05:01:43.368 --> 05:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
to determine who has the most votes if
 
05:01:45.410 --> 05:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
you don't count the entire ballot then
 
05:01:46.970 --> 05:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
you haven't determined who got the most
 
05:01:49.010 --> 05:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
votes it would be like stopping an
 
05:01:50.208 --> 05:01:50.218 align:start position:0%
election before you've counted all the
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
precincts and so for that reason it does
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
not violate the plurality provision and
 
05:01:58.490 --> 05:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
once again you know representative Reed
 
05:02:01.010 --> 05:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 50 threshold the 50
 
05:02:03.288 --> 05:02:03.298 align:start position:0%
threshold is not a threshold that
 
05:02:04.850 --> 05:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
someone has to get in order to win the
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
election it's the threshold that someone
 
05:02:09.708 --> 05:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
could win outright before running the
 
05:02:12.530 --> 05:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
rest of the ballots before running the
 
05:02:14.510 --> 05:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
rest of the rounds just because
 
05:02:16.368 --> 05:02:16.378 align:start position:0%
if someone gets that before you run all
 
05:02:17.570 --> 05:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
the rounds it's mathematically
 
05:02:19.550 --> 05:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
impossible for anyone else to win so you
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
already have a winner but they don't
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
have to get that in order to win there's
 
05:02:25.610 --> 05:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
no threshold to win the threshold to win
 
05:02:27.288 --> 05:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
is just run all the ballots unless
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
someone wins sooner run all the rounds I
 
05:02:31.128 --> 05:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
mean and run all the rounds unless
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
someone wins dinner so that's that's
 
05:02:34.910 --> 05:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
that in a nutshell if you have any other
 
05:02:36.890 --> 05:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to answer them any
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:02:42.288 --> 05:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you Miss Coleman
 
05:02:46.730 --> 05:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
um next up is Nathan Lockwood uh from
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.250 --> 05:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
hi thanks yeah so Nathan Lockwood of
 
05:03:00.650 --> 05:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
ranked the vote from Lunenburg Mass
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
um yeah just a couple real quick things
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of a lot of it's been
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
covered here I want to go back to talk a
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
05:03:09.650 --> 05:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
um issues related to counting the
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
ballots and speed of counting the
 
05:03:13.730 --> 05:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
ballots uh in this regard I want to
 
05:03:15.470 --> 05:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
refer back to that testimony from the
 
05:03:17.170 --> 05:03:17.180 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting Resource Center
 
05:03:20.330 --> 05:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
which goes into some depth on you know
 
05:03:22.128 --> 05:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
the the possibilities here just to
 
05:03:24.050 --> 05:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
briefly review there's a few different
 
05:03:27.530 --> 05:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
scenarios which for what the speed
 
05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
potential speed of counting would be in
 
05:03:31.010 --> 05:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire depending on whether you
 
05:03:32.990 --> 05:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
update your election equipment or not
 
05:03:35.810 --> 05:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
but one thing just to address that a
 
05:03:38.330 --> 05:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
concern that the deputy deputy secretary
 
05:03:40.010 --> 05:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
of state brought up was the ability of
 
05:03:42.170 --> 05:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
the current couriers the state police to
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
transport all of the the ballots which
 
05:03:46.610 --> 05:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know that would obviously have to be
 
05:03:47.930 --> 05:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
there might have to be some change there
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
if they're just you know using their
 
05:03:52.250 --> 05:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
their cars or whatever
 
05:03:54.110 --> 05:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
um one possibility if your machines were
 
05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
upgraded they could be what they would
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
be transporting is not they wouldn't
 
05:03:59.570 --> 05:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
have to transport that balance on
 
05:04:00.770 --> 05:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
Election I think it could transport that
 
05:04:02.448 --> 05:04:02.458 align:start position:0%
memory cards basically and then you
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
would get basically they would get them
 
05:04:06.350 --> 05:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
pull the memory cards duplicate them so
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
they have a backup send a send a copy of
 
05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
the memory card with a courier never
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
connecting to the internet throughout
 
05:04:14.090 --> 05:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
this process
 
05:04:16.490 --> 05:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
and then uh when that was received in
 
05:04:17.930 --> 05:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
the state that memory card would just be
 
05:04:17.940 --> 05:04:19.010 align:start position:0%
the state that memory card would just be
uploaded

05:04:19.010 --> 05:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
uploaded
 
05:04:21.890 --> 05:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
and the electronic tally uh could occur
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
quite rapidly
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that regardless of
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
whether you upgrade your Machinery in
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or not you could get an
 
05:04:32.090 --> 05:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
initial count of the first preferences
 
05:04:34.550 --> 05:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the same way that you get your
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
account however you get it right now off
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
your your current ballots uh meaning the
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
precincts would be reporting
 
05:04:44.990 --> 05:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
the the number of uh first choices that
 
05:04:46.730 --> 05:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
each candidate got and that would be
 
05:04:48.770 --> 05:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
transmitted in whatever form you're
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
doing now to the uh to the central
 
05:04:53.390 --> 05:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
location and and that could be reported
 
05:04:56.810 --> 05:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
as a preliminary result is as well
 
05:04:59.448 --> 05:04:59.458 align:start position:0%
um a couple other kind of Innovations in
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
terms of counting and transparency uh
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
the State of the State of there's a
 
05:05:05.090 --> 05:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
couple jurisdictions that you know
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting
 
05:05:09.410 --> 05:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh in the U.S is really grown a lot as
 
05:05:11.208 --> 05:05:11.218 align:start position:0%
folks have described since about the
 
05:05:14.090 --> 05:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
early 2000s and uh
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
and uh there's some great examples of
 
05:05:18.230 --> 05:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
transparency in Maine for example and I
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
believe other jurisdictions do this as
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
well all of the cast vote records from
 
05:05:24.890 --> 05:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
each Precinct are made immediately
 
05:05:26.448 --> 05:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
available to
 
05:05:29.208 --> 05:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
the public basically so if anyone wants
 
05:05:31.730 --> 05:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
to check the Secretary of State's Mains
 
05:05:34.550 --> 05:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
math they can take the same data the
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
secretary is using and run it on their
 
05:05:37.440 --> 05:05:39.170 align:start position:0%
secretary is using and run it on their
own

05:05:39.170 --> 05:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:05:42.410 --> 05:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
um the other the other the other example
 
05:05:43.788 --> 05:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
of transparency outside and I don't know
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
if Maine does this San Francisco is a
 
05:05:47.930 --> 05:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's been using ranked
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
Choice voting since 2005. uh they
 
05:05:52.010 --> 05:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
recently updated their election
 
05:05:54.110 --> 05:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
equipment one of the features of this
 
05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
highly secure equipment is that it
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
captures an image of each ballot cast so
 
05:06:01.610 --> 05:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
in addition to the tabulated cast vote
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
record which gives you a mathematical
 
05:06:05.510 --> 05:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
description of the values on every vote
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
cast they actually have a photo image of
 
05:06:10.310 --> 05:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
every ballot that is uh available the
 
05:06:12.770 --> 05:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
public and can be inspected and you can
 
05:06:15.530 --> 05:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
actually go download it from the board
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
of elections in San Francisco's website
 
05:06:19.010 --> 05:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh so there's some some nice
 
05:06:20.810 --> 05:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
transparency features that are offered
 
05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
by modern technology the recommendation
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
is is Tiani mentioned would be to do
 
05:06:27.410 --> 05:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
machine counting uh Cambridge actually
 
05:06:28.970 --> 05:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
did upgrade to machine counting I think
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
in the mid 90s there are jurisdictions
 
05:06:33.170 --> 05:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
that still do hand counting in the US
 
05:06:36.170 --> 05:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
not a lot I think St Paul was they may
 
05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
have upgraded since that said Austria
 
05:06:41.570 --> 05:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
Australia and Ireland who both use have
 
05:06:42.770 --> 05:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
used ranked Choice voting for over 100
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
years uh both are still using hand
 
05:06:45.240 --> 05:06:46.250 align:start position:0%
years uh both are still using hand
counting

05:06:46.250 --> 05:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
counting
 
05:06:48.288 --> 05:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
um Australia started to automate the
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice vote account for their
 
05:06:50.810 --> 05:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
senate elections but their house
 
05:06:52.970 --> 05:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
elections still hand counted and in
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
Ireland it's all all hand counting so
 
05:06:56.930 --> 05:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's very feasible I mean Ireland I
 
05:06:59.208 --> 05:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
think is over 4 million people uh they
 
05:07:00.890 --> 05:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
actually have as many members in their
 
05:07:04.128 --> 05:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
lower house as we have in the state
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
house in Massachusetts it's about 160.
 
05:07:09.288 --> 05:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
uh you folks have more uh more electives
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually than than either of us in that
 
05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
regard but it would still work well
 
05:07:14.040 --> 05:07:14.930 align:start position:0%
regard but it would still work well
um

05:07:14.930 --> 05:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know some of the folks that were
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
nervous about ranked Choice voting in
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
Maine someone mentioned Bruce Pelican
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
who was actually the plaintiff in the
 
05:07:23.330 --> 05:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
federal cases to block ranked Choice
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
voting in Maine after it was run
 
05:07:27.170 --> 05:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
what was interesting they had a rematch
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
this election of Bruce Pollock and the
 
05:07:31.070 --> 05:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
Republican versus Jared golden the
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
Democrat and uh also Tiffany Bond who
 
05:07:36.288 --> 05:07:36.298 align:start position:0%
was ran again as an independent an
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
interview you know in the news media
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
interviewed Bruce palkin and just I
 
05:07:40.730 --> 05:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
guess take his temperature and ranked
 
05:07:42.170 --> 05:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
Choice voting again I guess they they
 
05:07:43.850 --> 05:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
weren't sure where he was at after after
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
the two Federal lawsuits and whatnot so
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
this time around he said you know what
 
05:07:50.930 --> 05:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 when we used ranked Choice
 
05:07:52.550 --> 05:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
voting for the first time you know we
 
05:07:54.288 --> 05:07:54.298 align:start position:0%
didn't really know what it was about now
 
05:07:56.690 --> 05:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
we do and we know it's simple so it was
 
05:07:57.890 --> 05:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
a nice you know as a ranked Choice
 
05:07:59.390 --> 05:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
voting Advocate that was a really nice
 
05:08:01.250 --> 05:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh testimonial in terms of someone who
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
had let's say a pretty significant
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
amount of skepticism initially kind of
 
05:08:09.410 --> 05:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
kind of come around on the issue
 
05:08:09.420 --> 05:08:10.010 align:start position:0%
kind of come around on the issue
um

05:08:10.010 --> 05:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:12.350 --> 05:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
so one other thing someone talked to
 
05:08:14.030 --> 05:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
there was a great discussion about
 
05:08:17.208 --> 05:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting and does it help
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
more than the two parties or not
 
05:08:22.010 --> 05:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
um you know if you look at the trends in
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
Australia so initially both Ireland and
 
05:08:26.510 --> 05:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
Australia were considered to be pretty
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
two-party dominant not you know voters
 
05:08:30.170 --> 05:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
got more choices voters could express
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
themselves all the benefits folks have
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
talked about but in terms of ruling it
 
05:08:36.770 --> 05:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
tended to be one of two parties that's
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
really started to change in Australia
 
05:08:41.090 --> 05:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
and in Ireland over the last 20 years
 
05:08:44.270 --> 05:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
the trend is towards more voters
 
05:08:47.090 --> 05:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
being inclined to vote for
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
less you know the parties that haven't
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
been been in ruling uh for as long so
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
recently I think uh in in Ireland uh
 
05:08:59.030 --> 05:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
Shin Fein received a very large vote
 
05:09:00.530 --> 05:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
share and I don't think they formed a
 
05:09:04.190 --> 05:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
government but um in in Australia the
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
percentage received by independent
 
05:09:08.690 --> 05:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
candidates and by the green party uh
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
both conservative Independents and more
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
liberal parties like the green party has
 
05:09:13.550 --> 05:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
been steadily increasing they're still
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
not the ruling parties but I guess I
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
would say I think in general it's not
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
just Ireland Australia across the world
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
there's this concept of disaffiliation
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
where unlike maybe our parents
 
05:09:25.670 --> 05:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
generation or our parents parents
 
05:09:28.250 --> 05:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
generation that felt like you know it
 
05:09:28.260 --> 05:09:28.970 align:start position:0%
generation that felt like you know it
was

05:09:28.970 --> 05:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't know uh
 
05:09:35.570 --> 05:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know but later Miller late or
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
regular Miller you know one or the other
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh people are interested in having more
 
05:09:42.830 --> 05:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
choices in today's culture and uh what
 
05:09:43.850 --> 05:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is the election system
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
behaves as one would expect and allows
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
for better expression and better
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
representation based on those choices
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
although not doing anything by any means
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
drastic and last thing us or two more
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
things real quick
 
05:09:58.850 --> 05:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
folks have been talking about how ranked
 
05:10:00.890 --> 05:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
Choice voting combats polarization and
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're having interesting conversation
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
about the constitutionality and adopting
 
05:10:07.730 --> 05:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
it for state general elections what was
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
interesting is because you know Maine
 
05:10:10.850 --> 05:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
kind of got
 
05:10:12.530 --> 05:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
there was sort of a compromise in Maine
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
where because of an advisory opinion
 
05:10:16.490 --> 05:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
from the main Supreme Court the one
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
category of Elections Maine did not
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
adopt for was State offices general
 
05:10:24.410 --> 05:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
elections but Alaska did and one
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
interesting thing in the first cycle in
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
Alaska was you know for the Statewide
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
races Alaskan voters elected a very
 
05:10:37.850 --> 05:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
moderate Democrat uh peltola they
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
elected what was Lisa murkowski who's
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
considered a moderate Republican and for
 
05:10:44.030 --> 05:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
governor this is all the same elections
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
same voters they elected a someone who's
 
05:10:47.810 --> 05:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
considered to be a Conservative
 
05:10:52.010 --> 05:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
Republican Governor uh Dunleavy so that
 
05:10:53.690 --> 05:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
was it was pretty interesting to see the
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
voter expression and in their Senate
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
what was interesting in terms of the
 
05:10:59.628 --> 05:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
decreasing polarization increasing
 
05:11:01.610 --> 05:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
people working together in government to
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
get stuff done
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
the Alaskan senate had a 11 Republicans
 
05:11:08.330 --> 05:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
and nine Democrats elected the the
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
majority Coalition that formed was nine
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
Democrats eight Republicans with a
 
05:11:16.730 --> 05:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
republican speaker so bipartisan ruling
 
05:11:16.740 --> 05:11:18.110 align:start position:0%
republican speaker so bipartisan ruling
coalition

05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
coalition
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe it wouldn't be the
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
best thing for New Hampshire but imagine
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
if the political temperature was such
 
05:11:24.770 --> 05:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
that that was an option in New Hampshire
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
and people wanted to work together that
 
05:11:28.730 --> 05:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
closely across the aisle it might be
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
might be interesting and the very last
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
thing I will say here is uh you know
 
05:11:34.010 --> 05:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
Olivia raised a great point about
 
05:11:35.510 --> 05:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts with ranked
 
05:11:39.650 --> 05:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
Choice voting and uh and the impact on
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
voter confidence getting rid of
 
05:11:43.610 --> 05:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering and Glenn also mentioned
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things around stability of
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
the system those are some really great
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
benefits I mean you got a really
 
05:11:55.070 --> 05:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
participatory uh state house in um in
 
05:11:57.490 --> 05:11:57.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where there's a a
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of constituents
 
05:12:01.730 --> 05:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
for each representative which is a great
 
05:12:01.740 --> 05:12:03.410 align:start position:0%
for each representative which is a great
opportunity

05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:12:06.288 --> 05:12:06.298 align:start position:0%
um doing the upgrade to and you have
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
those multi-member districts which is
 
05:12:11.448 --> 05:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
Glenn described can produce kind of wild
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
swings in One Direction or the other
 
05:12:14.750 --> 05:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
where it's like you elect in all the
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
Democrats are you electing all the
 
05:12:17.628 --> 05:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
Republicans depending on how close the
 
05:12:19.490 --> 05:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
district is or you have some districts
 
05:12:20.810 --> 05:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
that are consistently one and some
 
05:12:22.250 --> 05:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
voters just never get their voice heard
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the State House
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the ranked Choice voting the reason
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
why it gets rid of the gerrymandering
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
the possibility of gerrymandering is
 
05:12:31.550 --> 05:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
because what Glenn describes that
 
05:12:34.190 --> 05:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
proportional way that it gets tabulated
 
05:12:35.510 --> 05:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:12:37.690 --> 05:12:37.700 align:start position:0%
the net result is that
 
05:12:40.010 --> 05:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
consistently a very high percentage of
 
05:12:40.020 --> 05:12:41.208 align:start position:0%
consistently a very high percentage of
Voters

05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
Voters
 
05:12:43.610 --> 05:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
see them elect a candidate that they
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
really like so in a five-member district
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
you will consistently see over 83
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
percent of Voters get a candidate they
 
05:12:51.840 --> 05:12:52.610 align:start position:0%
percent of Voters get a candidate they
like

05:12:52.610 --> 05:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
not in one not just in one District but
 
05:12:58.490 --> 05:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
across so 83 percent of the Republicans
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
83 percent of the Democrats electing
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
someone they like as opposed to right
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
now it's probably you know it best
 
05:13:06.288 --> 05:13:06.298 align:start position:0%
closer to 50 percent
 
05:13:07.970 --> 05:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh so everybody feels confidence
 
05:13:10.128 --> 05:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering's all predicated on
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
making sure some voters are less able to
 
05:13:15.170 --> 05:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
elect candidates that represent them and
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
with this that goes away and as Olivia
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
said people have more confidence in the
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
system and as Glenn said because you
 
05:13:22.550 --> 05:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
know you've got the same district
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
letting Democrats and Republicans first
 
05:13:25.850 --> 05:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
of all they now share something in
 
05:13:27.170 --> 05:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
common they're bringing home the bacon
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
for their district and number two
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
um it's much more stable is as opposed
 
05:13:33.890 --> 05:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
to a district that's going to swing one
 
05:13:35.448 --> 05:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
way or the other so you're going to have
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
a state house where it's people's
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
opinion changes over time it will
 
05:13:41.330 --> 05:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
gradually reflect that opinion but what
 
05:13:43.128 --> 05:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
won't happen is you'll have massive
 
05:13:44.810 --> 05:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
changes in the majority in the State
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
House based on small changes in you know
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
how certain voters feel about the issues
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
so I just want I'll sum up and say that
 
05:13:55.250 --> 05:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful opportunity I think
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions around the country are
 
05:13:58.430 --> 05:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
showing this is a very feasible reform
 
05:14:00.530 --> 05:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
to implement and has benefits that can
 
05:14:01.788 --> 05:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
really benefit
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the people in New Hampshire and and
 
05:14:05.330 --> 05:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
the people who represent them as well
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wood would you
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
grab the blue sheet for this and pass it
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
up please and now deputy secretary
 
05:14:14.760 --> 05:14:23.150 align:start position:0%
up please and now deputy secretary
Lovejoy

05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.368 --> 05:14:25.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair once again my name is
 
05:14:27.050 --> 05:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
Patricia Lovejoy I'm the senior deputy
 
05:14:28.788 --> 05:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
05:14:28.798 --> 05:14:29.868 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
um

05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:32.810 --> 05:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring up a few items one
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
on the Constitutional question we talked
 
05:14:37.010 --> 05:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
about earlier the plurality versus the
 
05:14:39.470 --> 05:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
majority of votes that's mentioned in
 
05:14:41.350 --> 05:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
our constitution three times
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
if we were to look to really go forward
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
with ranked Choice voting I think it
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea to ask the Supreme
 
05:14:51.288 --> 05:14:51.298 align:start position:0%
Court for an advisory opinion the same
 
05:14:55.550 --> 05:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
as as what Maine did on that issue
 
05:14:58.670 --> 05:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to bring up
 
05:15:03.410 --> 05:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
where we do have some towns that have
 
05:15:05.570 --> 05:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
very large districts when you're looking
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
at Dairy you have in a general election
 
05:15:11.570 --> 05:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
you are going to have 20 names on the
 
05:15:15.650 --> 05:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
ballot so you're going to have 20 names
 
05:15:19.788 --> 05:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
and going out 10 so ranking those 20
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
names who's your first choice second
 
05:15:24.368 --> 05:15:24.378 align:start position:0%
choice third choice
 
05:15:28.250 --> 05:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
we'll present a more complicated ballot
 
05:15:30.350 --> 05:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's just one of the issues to to keep
 
05:15:32.270 --> 05:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
05:15:34.430 --> 05:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
and we have in Dairy is not the only
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
example of that you have Merrimack has
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
eight so there would be 60 you know
 
05:15:40.368 --> 05:15:40.378 align:start position:0%
potential of 16 names
 
05:15:42.410 --> 05:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
um Bedford has seven so you're at 14
 
05:15:44.930 --> 05:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
names so there's several uh towns that
 
05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
that do have that issue
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
um one thing I also want to point out is
 
05:15:52.128 --> 05:15:52.138 align:start position:0%
the uh implementation date in this bill
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
for full the third stage is September of
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
26 that is not five years from now
 
05:16:01.368 --> 05:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
that's about three and a half years from
 
05:16:01.378 --> 05:16:02.570 align:start position:0%
that's about three and a half years from
now

05:16:02.570 --> 05:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I do not expect that the majority of
 
05:16:07.128 --> 05:16:07.138 align:start position:0%
our towns will have replaced their
 
05:16:08.930 --> 05:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
voting machines
 
05:16:11.090 --> 05:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
um the ballot law commission right now
 
05:16:14.890 --> 05:16:14.900 align:start position:0%
is looking at different machines we had
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
one type of machine tested out in a
 
05:16:19.930 --> 05:16:19.940 align:start position:0%
couple of towns in the November election
 
05:16:23.628 --> 05:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
there are two possibly three different
 
05:16:26.930 --> 05:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
um voting tabulators that will be used
 
05:16:29.628 --> 05:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
in the March elections but we're quite a
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
ways off from the ballot Mission
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
deciding what machines will be available
 
05:16:38.330 --> 05:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
for towns to purchase towns will have to
 
05:16:41.448 --> 05:16:41.458 align:start position:0%
go through that process probably at
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
their Town meetings to decide if they
 
05:16:46.910 --> 05:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
want to change their machines and the
 
05:16:49.690 --> 05:16:49.700 align:start position:0%
the cost of the machines
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
people were talking about real world
 
05:16:54.650 --> 05:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
examples of doing recounts just to give
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
you an idea of how long it does take if
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
you are doing a recount and recounts
 
05:17:03.708 --> 05:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
need to be done by hand
 
05:17:06.770 --> 05:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
in this last we did recounts for several
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
weeks this year much more so than we've
 
05:17:12.530 --> 05:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
done in the past we did Hillsborough
 
05:17:14.690 --> 05:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
County the entire Hillsborough County
 
05:17:14.700 --> 05:17:16.970 align:start position:0%
County the entire Hillsborough County
145

05:17:16.970 --> 05:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
145
 
05:17:19.850 --> 05:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
000 ballots we were only looking at One
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
race and just looking at whether the
 
05:17:24.650 --> 05:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
Democrat or the Republican got the vote
 
05:17:27.470 --> 05:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
so no ranked Choice voting it took us
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
the better half of four days we had
 
05:17:32.810 --> 05:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
eight teams and if any of you have
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
watched recounts since recounts are all
 
05:17:38.208 --> 05:17:38.218 align:start position:0%
public you need to we have teams of two
 
05:17:41.090 --> 05:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
people doing the counting we have one
 
05:17:44.390 --> 05:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know cameras and monitors
 
05:17:45.650 --> 05:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
um like I said it it took the better
 
05:17:50.330 --> 05:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
part of four days to recount 145 000
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
ballots when we were just looking at
 
05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
between you know two people
 
05:17:57.060 --> 05:17:57.890 align:start position:0%
between you know two people
um

05:17:57.890 --> 05:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:59.930 --> 05:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
and let's see what else did I have on
 
05:17:59.940 --> 05:18:00.708 align:start position:0%
and let's see what else did I have on
here

05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:18:00.718 --> 05:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
here
um

05:18:01.490 --> 05:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:04.010 --> 05:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
I if you you know if you decide you know
 
05:18:05.628 --> 05:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
looking at these two bills that you want
 
05:18:08.330 --> 05:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
to do a subcommittee the Secretary of
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
State's office would be more than
 
05:18:12.890 --> 05:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
willing to uh to work with you on uh
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
either or both of these bills
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think you know the the other
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
issues that I talked about last time uh
 
05:18:21.530 --> 05:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
in the previous bills still exist if
 
05:18:23.868 --> 05:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to have ranked Choice
 
05:18:23.878 --> 05:18:25.430 align:start position:0%
you're going to have ranked Choice
voting

05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
voting
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
or primaries you really need to consider
 
05:18:31.910 --> 05:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
the time frame between the primary and
 
05:18:33.650 --> 05:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
the general election and remember that
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
we have a 45-day federal
 
05:18:39.410 --> 05:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
federal requirement that we have to get
 
05:18:43.250 --> 05:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
our uokova votes out 45 days before the
 
05:18:50.650 --> 05:18:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you Ms
 
05:18:59.520 --> 05:19:01.070 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you Ms
Lovejoy

05:19:01.070 --> 05:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
Lovejoy
 
05:19:02.930 --> 05:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee now this is
 
05:19:08.330 --> 05:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
my third term we've been talking about
 
05:19:10.850 --> 05:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
new machines and we actually saw new
 
05:19:13.550 --> 05:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
machines and every session we're told
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're coming and now it's three and a
 
05:19:18.590 --> 05:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
half more years is that what I heard you
 
05:19:18.600 --> 05:19:19.670 align:start position:0%
half more years is that what I heard you
say

05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:19:23.330 --> 05:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
no I said in three this bill the the
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
full implementation of having all ranked
 
05:19:28.010 --> 05:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
Choice voting in this bill is three and
 
05:19:29.570 --> 05:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
a half years
 
05:19:30.770 --> 05:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
um it was stated earlier it was about
 
05:19:32.208 --> 05:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
five years but it's three and a half
 
05:19:32.218 --> 05:19:33.110 align:start position:0%
five years but it's three and a half
years

05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
um when when the full ranked choice and
 
05:19:37.730 --> 05:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
it is the ballot law Commission
 
05:19:41.570 --> 05:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
that controls what machines can be used
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the state it is not the Secretary of
 
05:19:46.550 --> 05:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
State's office the legislation gives
 
05:19:46.560 --> 05:19:47.530 align:start position:0%
State's office the legislation gives
that

05:19:47.530 --> 05:19:47.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:49.368 --> 05:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the ballot law
 
05:19:49.378 --> 05:19:50.750 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the ballot law
Commission

05:19:50.750 --> 05:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
05:19:52.850 --> 05:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:19:58.610 --> 05:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
05:20:01.070 --> 05:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question it sounds like Maine
 
05:20:03.230 --> 05:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
is able to run elections with ranked
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
Choice voting
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
successfully should that example give
 
05:20:09.170 --> 05:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
this committee confidence that the New
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Secretary of State's office
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
could also run elections according to
 
05:20:14.930 --> 05:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting successfully
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
with different voting machines
 
05:20:21.170 --> 05:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
our our current voting machines do not
 
05:20:25.368 --> 05:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
have the um the the capability that we
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
know of to be able to
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
um to do this ranked Choice voting I do
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
believe that if we had different
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
machines and you are talking about
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
um that all the results are on a thumb
 
05:20:38.878 --> 05:20:39.890 align:start position:0%
um that all the results are on a thumb
drive

05:20:39.890 --> 05:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
drive
 
05:20:42.830 --> 05:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
the our current Courier system I hate
 
05:20:45.650 --> 05:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
calling the uh our state police couriers
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
but uh the current system where our
 
05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
state police bring the the tablets and
 
05:20:56.510 --> 05:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
the voting the voting results sheet to
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
the state house if it's just a thumb
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
drive yes but I do do I believe that we
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
will be at that point that every town
 
05:21:07.430 --> 05:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
will have
 
05:21:11.810 --> 05:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
um upgraded there to a new machine by
 
05:21:14.590 --> 05:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
September 1st of 2026
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
you're all from your individual towns
 
05:21:20.510 --> 05:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
you have a better idea in your
 
05:21:22.368 --> 05:21:22.378 align:start position:0%
individual town of how fast something
 
05:21:25.850 --> 05:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative Berry off of uh
 
05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead's question he's
 
05:21:32.570 --> 05:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
asked is Maine a good example would
 
05:21:34.368 --> 05:21:34.378 align:start position:0%
maybe a good example
 
05:21:36.288 --> 05:21:36.298 align:start position:0%
um doesn't it take Maine a week to get
 
05:21:37.850 --> 05:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
their election results in is that your
 
05:21:37.860 --> 05:21:39.170 align:start position:0%
their election results in is that your
understanding

05:21:39.170 --> 05:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
I am not that familiar with Maine's
 
05:21:44.030 --> 05:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
process and how quickly I mean I know
 
05:21:47.448 --> 05:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
that they had time to get the uh the
 
05:21:50.090 --> 05:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
ballots or get the information to the
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
State House their primaries also in June
 
05:22:00.590 --> 05:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:02.990 --> 05:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
for any questions
 
05:22:10.250 --> 05:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:13.010 --> 05:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
okay uh blue sheet has eight in favor
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
three against and that concludes the
 
05:22:21.410 --> 05:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:24.050 --> 05:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
so house build 402 is on the house
 
05:22:27.170 --> 05:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
calendar as an executive session having
 
05:22:28.730 --> 05:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
not had a public hearing you know that's
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
not right
 
05:22:32.510 --> 05:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
and then on these notices of public
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
hearing because of that confusion and my
 
05:22:38.930 --> 05:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
being a stickler about proper notices
 
05:22:40.610 --> 05:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
there will be no hearing on house built
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:47.090 --> 05:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
so that leaves us in recess for well
 
05:36:46.490 --> 05:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:01.628 --> 05:37:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:07.070 --> 05:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:37:09.050 --> 05:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
I'll open the executive session on House
 
05:37:11.208 --> 05:37:11.218 align:start position:0%
Bill 101 representative Berry is
 
05:37:13.010 --> 05:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
recognized for emotions uh yes Mr
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I move that uh House Bill 101
 
05:37:17.570 --> 05:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
be inexpedient to legislate
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative Berry would you like to
 
05:37:46.730 --> 05:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh briefly
 
05:37:49.970 --> 05:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
um uh hb101 removes the ability for
 
05:37:53.570 --> 05:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated voters to cast a ballot in
 
05:37:55.550 --> 05:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
a partisan primary I don't need to go
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
into the details of the committee about
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
how that's technically not true but one
 
05:38:01.430 --> 05:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the things that's in the RSA is the
 
05:38:03.170 --> 05:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
political parties now have the ability
 
05:38:05.628 --> 05:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
to choose if they want to allow
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated voters or not so the bill
 
05:38:09.650 --> 05:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
will be effectively removing that choice
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's no point in doing that if either
 
05:38:13.070 --> 05:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
political party thought this was a good
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
idea they could hardly implement it so
 
05:38:17.930 --> 05:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
why take it away from them
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the roll
 
05:38:25.610 --> 05:38:25.620 align:start position:0%

we're gonna chain bills do not have a
 
05:44:16.128 --> 05:44:16.138 align:start position:0%
committee report so that isn't necessary
 
05:44:17.810 --> 05:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't go on the calendar for
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
the house to vote on it's the bill is
 
05:44:21.470 --> 05:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
now still in our possession
 
05:44:23.628 --> 05:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
so that'll close the executive session
 
05:44:26.570 --> 05:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 116. a couple quick notes
 
05:44:28.128 --> 05:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
before we go
 
05:44:31.548 --> 05:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
I was asked a really good question
 
05:44:34.670 --> 05:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
earlier today so I couldn't make it this
 
05:44:36.770 --> 05:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
morning representative Berry was here he
 
05:44:38.750 --> 05:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
opened it what if he wasn't here then
 
05:44:40.730 --> 05:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative Bohm will open it what
 
05:44:42.530 --> 05:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
happens if representative Smith Berry
 
05:44:43.910 --> 05:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
and Bohm
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
are not here this means that the world
 
05:44:48.170 --> 05:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
has ended and you don't have to worry
 
05:44:49.490 --> 05:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
about the hearing
 
05:44:49.500 --> 05:44:52.368 align:start position:0%
about the hearing
yeah

05:44:52.368 --> 05:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:55.250 --> 05:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
but um no seriously what would happen is
 
05:44:57.048 --> 05:44:57.058 align:start position:0%
representative barrier I would have
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
contacted the speaker's office to make
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
somebody came over here at the appointed
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
time during whatever Calamity occurred
 
05:45:09.530 --> 05:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
um procedure on Executive sessions I
 
05:45:14.090 --> 05:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
have no idea why I wrote that down in my
 
05:45:15.948 --> 05:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
notes so we'll skip it
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
but anyway so that's what happens
 
05:45:22.190 --> 05:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
first bill that we're sending to the
 
05:45:24.770 --> 05:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
calendar is on Con on consent that makes
 
05:45:28.250 --> 05:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
me happy thank you you're free to go
