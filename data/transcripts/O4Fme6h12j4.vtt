00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
calling the committee conference to
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
order on HB 315 and with that we are
 
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
going to take a short break on CF
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Avis joins us in the next five
 
00:05:44.160 --> 00:10:35.630 align:start position:0%
Senator Avis joins us in the next five
minutes

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm reopening the
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
committee conference on House Bill 315
 
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.949 align:start position:0%
committee conference on House Bill 315
and

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I'm going to do to
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
start is I'm going to ask the Senate
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
conferes if you could tell us why you
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
why what was the impetus for changing
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
the bill from the what the house passed
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
which we passed on a
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
when you included all these other
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
protected classes and I think race
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
religion there's a whole and then some
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
political points as well
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
there was the concern of potential
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of expanding at
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
that that broad so we had concern about
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
doing that and if we were ever you know
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
increase the scope we would really want
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
to cover each topic individually have a
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
hearing on that to make sure we didn't
 
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
take it in the direction we weren't
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
intending on going in
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
so we thought it would make more sense
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
to put uh amended back to its original
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
the original bill which really had a
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
narrower application of when it would
 
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
apply and I know that that there's a
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill that we had last term so it was I
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
was familiar with it
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
and I I knew that passed in the house
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
last term and I was hoping
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
I was confident we can get it done so
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
that that was the reason why we did that
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
is that was not meant as any
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
disrespecting any of the classes that
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
were listed no and I would never assume
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
that it was I was just we were concerned
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
because we we did um we did pass it out
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
of our committee Nana's Lane that passed
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
on a Voice vote on the floor
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
um I I was could you give me an example
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
of what maybe the non-intended
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
consequence might be if we were to leave
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
it anyone just
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
sure well and just to clarify when it
 
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
comes to the other classes I have not
 
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.670 align:start position:0%
comes to the other classes I have not
heard

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
or we didn't receive any testimony of
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
anyone raising those as a potential
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
defense or a mitigation defense we're
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
saying oh racer religion was involved
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
and that's why they should get a lesser
 
00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:31.730 align:start position:0%
and that's why they should get a lesser
offense

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear about that anywhere in
 
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
the country never mind here in New
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that was one of the other
 
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
reasons but let's just say religion
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
right people have an argument about
 
00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:42.650 align:start position:0%
right people have an argument about
religion

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
religion
 
00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:45.019 align:start position:0%
it can be debated they get an
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
altercation that that's what happens
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't really feel that that was
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
something that we really wanted to cover
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
because one we're not clear that that
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be even an appropriate time to
 
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
raise a mitigation defense but we just
 
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
felt that
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
that was not really what we were
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
debating Mr chair yes thank you Senator
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question you
 
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.129 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question you
know

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to sort of argue in the
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
alternative because I actually voted for
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
the full version that the house sent
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
over but um I know that there were
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by the defense bar and
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh not specifically about the other you
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
know things that the house put in
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
rightly but um just the important
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
balance between the Constitutional
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
issues with having someone being able to
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
mount a defense and balancing it with
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
the very important issues that were
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
raised and so I think
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
um that was the concern that maybe we
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
needed more time to strike that right
 
00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
balance rather than we never want to add
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
I think having already spoken with our
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
conference that we we can understand now
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
um having said that we we did have some
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill as it was sent
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
over from the Senate and I'm going to
 
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:03.740 align:start position:0%
ask if that you will indulge me
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn to address the
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
conferries on on what the concern was
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
committee uh I'm Bob Wayne I'm rep from
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh Windham and the the uh now first I I
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
want to say at the outset as I said to
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
um the last week
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
I I raised this issue because I'm
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
concerned because I was concerned about
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences on the question
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
of the basic purpose of the legislation
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a very strong supporter of it
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
um but if you go to the Senate version
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill uh that was passed
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
and what was before the house for the
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
question of whether we would concur or
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
not here was my concern
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
in in the new proposed paragraph for a
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
what I believe would happen if the if
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
this were presented to a court for to to
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
construe it the way the court would read
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
the language is if you go down to line
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
eight and I'm starting to where it says
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
provocation was not objectively
 
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
reasonable I think what would happen is
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
the court would put would read it as if
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
there was a coal in there was not
 
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.220 align:start position:0%
objectively reasonable
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
colon one if and then that would go if
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
if it resulted from from the discovery
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
of knowledge about
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
or potential disclosure of the victims
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
actual or perceived gender gender
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
identity gender expression sex or sexual
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
orientation including under
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which the victim made
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
an unwanted non-forcible romantic or
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
sexual Advance towards the defendant
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
comma and then the court would say or
 
00:15:57.129 --> 00:15:57.139 align:start position:0%
and would put in a two
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
if the defense if the defendant and
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
victim dated or had a romantic or sexual
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
relationship and I think there's a
 
00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:05.779 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons for that for example
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
first I know there was some some you
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
know some suggestion well maybe this
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
maybe that last Clause was really meant
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
to be you know sort of modified by the
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
earlier Clause but the problem is you've
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
got two and I I this sounds this may
 
00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:23.779 align:start position:0%
sound kind of silly but it's the way
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
statutory construction Works you've got
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
two IFS so you know the court would say
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
what they what really what they really
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
meant was one if one or if two and and
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
the problem with if you if you if you
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
read the language that would say
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
provocation was not re was not
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
objectively reasonable if the defendant
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
and victim dated or had a romantic or
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
sexual relationship and you take out all
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
of that stuff before you know that in in
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
Clause one what that could be read to
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
mean would be what the the sort of
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
law school case book example of when
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
provocation can legitimately be raised
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
that is you know you come home you think
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
you're happily married you come home
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
early from work one day and you find
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
your wife or husband whatever the case
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
as the case may be in bed with somebody
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
else and you're outraged and you
 
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
immediately shoot your your wife or
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
husband and the the third party that's
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
sort of a typical
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
situation where the law has has allowed
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
a defendant to raise the issue of
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
extreme provocation
 
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.529 align:start position:0%
extreme provocation
and

00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
two would seem to say you can't do that
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
anymore and I I didn't you know I don't
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
think that that was the intent to want
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
to to to want to uh want to do that and
 
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
so that was my concern
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chair right so thank you for
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
raising that I I my understanding and
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
someone can correct me if I'm wrong is
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
that what that section was intended to
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
address is that if a transgender
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
individual had not disclosed prior their
 
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
gender identity that if it was later
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
disclosed that couldn't be used so I
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
think that's what that was intended to
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
address but but I think that that could
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
be addressed in other ways to avoid the
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
issues that you're raising no exactly I
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
mean I think I'm sure that that was what
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
you know was intended it's just that the
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
way it it you'd have to recast the
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
language somehow to to change it so uh
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I and I I would I would love
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
to be able to say this was a great this
 
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
was my idea and I really but I didn't
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
this uh uh uh week uh there were two
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
suggested changes
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
um representative koutab had suggested a
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
change which is which would simply be to
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
take out that last clause and end end
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
the uh and the uh
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
the sentence in paragraph four ended
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
with the word defendant on line 11. so
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
just remove that that uh that uh
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh that that last Clause oh
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry and she and and also take out
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
the word unwanted so that it would
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
simply say it would simply be
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
non-forceable that that that is a way to
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
do it which would avoid the issue that
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
um that uh I just discussed but I think
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
that um a better suggestion is what is
 
00:19:29.529 --> 00:19:29.539 align:start position:0%
proposed in Amendment
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
2023-223 which I uh had prepared and
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
I've offered for the committee's
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
consideration and it's based on uh some
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
information provided to us prior law
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
professor from Georgia who apparently
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
has really spent a lot of time focusing
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
on this area he's worked with
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
legislatures in other states I think
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
maybe Illinois and Michigan and some
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.169 align:start position:0%
other states
um

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
he's a proponent of this yes he's a
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
proponent of of uh of you know the of
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as uh eliminating the
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
sort of gay Panic uh defense and so that
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
is what is is contained in that in this
 
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.029 align:start position:0%
is what is is contained in that in this
amendment

00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
I think the language as he pointed out
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
the language was drafted very carefully
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
with a lot of input from various
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and it was designed to make
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
sure that it didn't you know it it that
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
it didn't go too far that in other words
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
that it's it basically said if if
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
something does not would not constitute
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
a basis for for constituting extreme
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
provocation under the law
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
it doesn't become so on the ground on
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
the basis that you know you uh uh the
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
the actor's knowledge of or discovery of
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
the sexual gender sexual identification
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
gender identification sexual orientation
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
of of the victim uh the the thing I
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
thought I so I thought that that
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
language is very good and the other
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
thing that I really thought was was
 
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
a a an improvement in this over the any
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
of the versions of both the house or the
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
Senate version
 
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:12.980 align:start position:0%
is that this version
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
makes it apply not just to the
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
circumstance of where you're trying to
 
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.450 align:start position:0%
circumstance of where you're trying to
reduce

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
murder to manslaughter that's the
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
extreme provocation part but it would
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
also apply in the circumstances of
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
self-defense in other words your person
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
cannot this would this would say if if
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
you're not otherwise justified in acting
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
in self-defense you can't say well but
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
the person was the person that I acted
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
against was transgender or or you know
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
gay or whatever and that made it all
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
right this would say you can't do that
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and that's it seems to me that's
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know that to me that's a no-brainer
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
you should not be able to you should not
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
be able to use that as a as a basis to
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
say you know violence was justified
 
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's my view
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
we have a couple questions I'm just
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
gonna ask one first so this language has
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
been used in other states
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
yes it's you know what the I mean I
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
worded it to conform with our statute
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
but the LA yes the substance of the
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
language is you know has been has been
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
used in other states I should say
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
according to what the professor said in
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
his email to us I didn't go you know I
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
didn't go look up Illinois Law or
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
Michigan law but that I'm assuming he
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
was telling us he was telling us the
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
truth I have no reason to believe he was
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um Senator William yes
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you I think this language does
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
get us closer the only thing that I want
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
this committee to consider is the
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
situation uh actually where a lot of
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
this legislation has arised it was with
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
the death of and murder of Matthew
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
Shepard and in that situation there was
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
unwanted sexual advances and that was
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
part of the situation so I think the
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
only thing that this language doesn't
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
have is is that scenario so I'm
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
wondering if the committee wants to
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
consider you know sort of adding a
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
clause similar to to line 10 and 11 of
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
as amended by the Senate including under
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which the victim made
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
an unwanted
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
and I think there was conversation about
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
should it be unwanted or non-forcible I
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
think just unwanted
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
romantic or sexual advance for the
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
defendant we could add that Clause at
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
the very end of this language presented
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
by representative Lin and that would
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
address the so-called Matthew Shepard
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
situation the only thing I have concerns
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
with and I want to avoid is is uh the
 
00:23:41.409 --> 00:23:41.419 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of it applying
 
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
also to a woman who a man is is making
 
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
unwanted sexual advances towards and she
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
feels threatened her bodily safety and
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
she reacts is she now barred because we
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
put this in here yes I think that's a to
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
respond if I may I think that's a very
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
valid concern and so we would have to
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
tie it to this very situation in the in
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh that we're talking about here related
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
to someone's sexual orientation gender
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
identification or gender expression
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
because I think that's a very valid con
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
so we would have to tie it together if
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
um with the senator and actually what
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
you just brought up is what I'm sitting
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
here going into a little bit of
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
convulsions over
 
00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:27.470 align:start position:0%
convulsions over
is

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
and and all joking aside
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
a person's perception is their own
 
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.890 align:start position:0%
a person's perception is their own
reality

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
and I do not see myself
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of anything that is saying
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
non-forcible romantic or sexual advances
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
for the defendant that that can turn
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
on a dime
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
that can't that can't that wording
 
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
cannot be in here you you cannot tell
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
somebody that that something was
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
non-enforceable because the person that
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
started to be non-forceable ended up
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
becoming non-forceable you can't do that
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
you can't tell a person that it wasn't
 
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.590 align:start position:0%
you can't tell a person that it wasn't
non-forceable

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
non-forceable
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
unwanted touching his unwanted touching
 
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.190 align:start position:0%
unwanted touching his unwanted touching
period

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
but I I believe if we are very specific
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
and narrow in the language we might be
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
able to to craft it such that that does
 
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
not become the issue
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
um is this your proposed ad it is
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative I fully agree with you
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
it's a non-starter for me as well and
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's why it's I fully agree with you
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's very important to
 
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:39.419 align:start position:0%
tie that piece just to
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
um the so-called gay Panic defense and
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn did you have a you
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
know I looked at I looked at your
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
proposed language I think that you know
 
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
the way you word it that's fine I don't
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see I don't think that's a
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
problem did the other house conference
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
would you um any comments or thoughts
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to put you on the spot
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right um so go ahead yes
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
I want to say that I think at this
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
moment it's important that we do
 
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
subscribe to the house version I thought
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
we came up with a really good proposal
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
which included uh religion race Creed
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation and I think that's a
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
a solid way to to go about it and those
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
are the right classes that we should be
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
protecting and it seems to me that the
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
senate had added a little bit too much
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
and given that we had passed it with a
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
Voice vote unanimous vote in the
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
committee uh and on consent that we
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
should move forward with the house
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
position on
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.890 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
I would also like to if he's here um
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
he's a sponsor like if you would um what
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on the um the
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have before us with
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
the language that Senator Whitley just
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
added if you have it or maybe you don't
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative Sean filio I represent
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
Ward 2 in Keene
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
the amendment that has been proposed by
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn it goes a long ways
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
towards addressing the concerns that
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
were raised uh in the house during the
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
concurrence as well as raised with
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
regards to the issues of self-defense
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
and provocation
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to be careful not
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
to lose the the forest for the trees
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
ultimately what this bill is trying to
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
do is protect lgbtq individuals from
 
00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
do is protect lgbtq individuals from
violence

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
violence
 
00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:30.299 align:start position:0%
and this proposed change does that
 
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:33.500 align:start position:0%
while we can address issues related to
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
unwanted sexual advances
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
that language can be dealt with at a
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
later time do you see it right there
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
though I do see that language and if
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
this becomes but if this language
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
becomes controversial
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
we can address that issue at a later
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
time because the proposed amendment does
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
the job it protects lgbtq individuals at
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
a time when we are seeing unprecedented
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
heightened violence towards lgbtq
 
00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:01.850 align:start position:0%
heightened violence towards lgbtq
individuals

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
and while I appreciate the house version
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
that dealt with issues such as race
 
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
religion Creed political beliefs
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
we see that the gay Panic defense has
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
been used it is used every year it has
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
been used thousands of times and it has
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
been used successfully and that is why
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
the American Bar Association recommends
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
that it be abolished
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
we don't see that these other defenses
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
have been used and in fact by abolishing
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense we would then
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
create precedent that a class-based
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
defense and I'm using class in the broad
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
sense of a group of individuals that a
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
class-based provocation defense is
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
unacceptable making it less likely that
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
a court would allow it and that a jury
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
would buy it by protecting one or going
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
some ways towards protecting all
 
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
so by doing the job here of protecting
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
the group that was originally tried to
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
be addressed by this bill
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're protecting each this is not the
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
moment to turn this down by losing the
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
forest for the trees
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate your input thank
 
00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:17.330 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate your input thank
you

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm going to ask if the
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
Senate would mind if we um took a 10
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
minute break and just so we could all
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
confer we have you have the language you
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
gave us
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
and do we have it we have
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
no but I'd like to see uh
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah just so that we are all working on
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
she disappoint me
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.740 --> 01:04:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
uh the committee of conference
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that we have come to a
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
language that I think we can all agree
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
on in principle people one of the
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
concerns of the house
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
of the house conferees and it was a
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern is that in any
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
circumstance whatsoever that a woman
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be barred from raising a
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
self-defense claim if an unwanted sexual
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
Advance or or of any kind were against
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
her and she felt threatened to the point
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
where she would be justified as using
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
Force she would be barred from using
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
that self-defense force it is we we have
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
changed it so that such that this is
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
very extremely narrow it would not
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
affect that situation and it is the
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that this not apply
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
and limit a woman's right to
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
self-defense in any way shape or form
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
and I I would ask that the Senate um if
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
they have anything to say I think we're
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I would I would agree with that
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
description so you know absolutely
 
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.309 align:start position:0%
description so you know absolutely
self-defense

01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
uh is still uh permitted in this
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
situation we're talking about homicide
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about the situation
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
where you cannot say I committed well it
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a mitigating factor to say I
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
committed this murder because that
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
person was gay so it does not
 
01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
person was gay so it does not
um

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
in any way change the situation that I
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
rightly agree with you regarding a
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
there's a difference there's a
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
completely different defenses one's a
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
mitigation defense self-defense is a as
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
an affirmative defense you're not guilty
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
at that point so they're different
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
defenses altogether they're not the same
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why with the original bill I
 
01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:03.059 align:start position:0%
think if you look at the RSA it's under
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we've been talking
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
about should go into that section not
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
under the other RSA I think it was so
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
what you're so what you're referring to
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative is maintaining the
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense which we are not
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
touching at all what we what we are
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
addressing in this proposal is that
 
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.569 align:start position:0%
addressing in this proposal is that
mitigating

01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
um having said that um I think that
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
we've um is there anything else you'd
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
like to add I'd just like to add um that
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
I will be coming back next year with a
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
build to make sure that we address the
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
other uh concerns that were addressed by
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
the house version uh race and other
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
things but I'm glad that we were able to
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
come up with an agreement uh to to ban
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense which is I think
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
an important thing to do and I would be
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
proud to co-sponse that that bill with
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
you uh representative wheeler and to
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
save you some time just maybe we talk
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
about that off off
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
all right uh at this point um we um we
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
would uh like to vote um is the house in
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
favor of this language
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
all in favor in the Senate yes yes then
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
we have an agreement and um we will get
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
this typed up uh by OLS and we will get
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
the conference sign-off
 
01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:21.420 align:start position:0%

01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
