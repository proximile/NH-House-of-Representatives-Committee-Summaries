00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
so anyway would either of you two like
 
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
to say anything about forms do you have
 
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
any input before we ask the
 
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
clerks simply what we all know and that
 
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
is because 80% of the uh litigant in Pro
 
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
in family court or prosay the easier the
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
better the easier to fill out especially
 
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
since the court says you well know are
 
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.589 align:start position:0%
since the court says you well know are
sure-handed

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
sure-handed
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
um despite the generous race we gave you
 
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to the head of Finance
 
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 align:start position:0%
uh don't be surprised two years from now
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
either um there may not always be people
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
right there to translate the forms so
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
the forms need to be obvious and it's
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
something we all know
 
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
you so I'm just looking at the um the
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
Court's page where it does have the form
 
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
and I guess I the question I would have
 
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
is if these forms when I pull them up
 
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
they don't seem to be um fillable online
 
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
do you it's like they have to be printed
 
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
out rather than filling them out right
 
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
online and then printing them um or
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
saving them as a PDF and I don't know
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
how that is and then the other question
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
I would have is just how are we
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
educating the public to actually find
 
00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
them if they come in and um or they want
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
a file for something I'm just wondering
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
how do they know that this even
 
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
available to them as opposed to they
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
have to hire an attorney right away to
 
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.310 align:start position:0%
have to hire an attorney right away to
find

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
this yes uh thank you first of all for
 
00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 align:start position:0%
your interest in this topic uh forums
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
are something that we obviously use
 
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
every single day and that
 
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
self-represented uh litigant in
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
particular uh we hope we'll find sorry
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
could you go ahead and introduce
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
yourself just so that we have that
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
apologies thank you so much uh yes I'm
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
the senior Circuit Court Administrator
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
Heather kulp uh and so I work with judge
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
king whom you heard from last week on
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
managing the Circuit Court processes Etc
 
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
um and really our expert today is uh
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
elain low who's our clerk from OIP and
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
Conway on uh forms and on on uh user
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
experience with form so I can speak to
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
kind of policy and practice issues um
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
from there
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
so we offer a few different ways that
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
folks can learn how what forms are
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
needed for a particular case step in
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
family division um so one way is our
 
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting website for
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
instance will include the list of forms
 
00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
that's needed to complete a divorce and
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
parenting case and it's hyperlink to um
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
to the exact form that's needed um some
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
of those also have instruction sheets
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
along with it so it's it's not just what
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
forms are needed but also there's some
 
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
instructions for how to complete those
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
so that's one way is directly on our
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
website for divorce and parenting for
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
instance uh you'll see that list of
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
forms that's needed um we also will
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
print out and provide forms at the
 
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
courts themselves for folks so if
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
someone comes in and and says I have a
 
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
parenting case I want to uh work through
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
parenting issues with the other parent
 
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
of my child um we will Point them to the
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
correct forms and can print print out
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
those forms for them as well um and then
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
we also have court processes that will
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh provide them with the forms directly
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
so if they file a petition for divorce
 
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
for instance uh the P the court staff
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
person putting together um uh their
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
initial packet will send them forms and
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
we'll send them a list of the forms
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's needed to complete their case so
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
even if they file one one petition
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
opening a case um we can point them to
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
the appropriate forms um did that answer
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
your question representative
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
ball yes and I'm I'm looking at the um
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
the list of forms I just picked up I
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't even know which one I did divorce
 
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
and parenting and I noticed that the
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
forms are all um in alphabetical order
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering if there's any type of
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
a road map um that you give to people at
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
the courthouse or that they're somewhere
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
on this website that might actually lay
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
it out in very easy terms in a visual of
 
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
like if this then that and then these
 
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
are the forms just because if they're in
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order I think it's kind of
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
hard for people to figure out which do I
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
have to fill out all of these you know
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
so that's my question and you can feel
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
free to use that computer if there's a
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
page that you want to bring up to kind
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
of show or to demonstrate that would be
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
fantastic too so feel free to use that
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
computer great yes maybe we'll do that
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
would you mind bringing up the divorce
 
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.469 align:start position:0%
would you mind bringing up the divorce
and

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
parenting um web page that has the list
 
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:34.750 align:start position:0%
parenting um web page that has the list
of

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
website and if you want to switch seats
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
we can do that as well why don't we do
 
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:58.190 align:start position:0%
we can do that as well why don't we do
that

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
so I I'll try to narrate as I'm doing so
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of the record um so I'm
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
going to the Family Division
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
website and if you go to the divorce and
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
parenting page there it provides
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
information for someone going through
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
divorce or parenting case uh about both
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
the process and then also the forms that
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
might be needed so if I am uh seeking a
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
divorce I can click on how do you file a
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
divorce petition and that will bring up
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
the list of apologize for my slow
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
scrolling uh that will uh bring up a
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
couple other options so for instance do
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
you have minor
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
children uh I will select
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes and then that guides me to how to
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
start my divorce proceeding and how to
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
complete my divorce proceeding including
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
the list of forms available there
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so it takes a little bit of the
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
guesswork out of that alphabetical order
 
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.069 align:start position:0%
guesswork out of that alphabetical order
of

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
forms um to have the information kind of
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
guide people through a list of questions
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
that they may need to answer before it's
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
needed thank
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
you how'd you get to that page because
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
when I went on um on
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
mine intuition is telling me to just go
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
right here where says forms and fees M
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
and then I I've lost I didn't come
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
across that at all so maybe it's
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
something right here on this front page
 
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.389 align:start position:0%
something right here on this front page
that

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
somehow we need to direct people better
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
or am I maybe it's a difference between
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
no you have a computer versus an iPad or
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
something it looks
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
different um I
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't yep so our courts and then the
 
00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
Family Division up here so it's in the
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
main menu but I appreciate your
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation about
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
um about where you intuitively end up on
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
the website I thought you were talking
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
about the website I'm like no it doesn't
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
say ords okay see
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
I as a person not
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
familiar not ever going to go there I I
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
saw this as being see how this is much
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
bigger forms and fees
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
boom it might just be a matter of making
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
the actual page
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
um a little bit easier to understand for
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
courts and I should say too that we know
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
that because uh judge Ashley was here um
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
graciously spent some of our time and
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
talk to us about that you guys are
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
looking at forms I do understand that
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
before each of the courts kind of had
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
their own forms so one of the processes
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
you guys went through was to bring all
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
the forms to where every Court had the
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
same forms which is super helpful and
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
now that you've got them all that at
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
least the same it's about kind of going
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
through them and she talked about you
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
know going through the highest use forms
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
um the family lens the most frequently
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
filled out incorrectly I do know that
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
you guys kind of have a system that
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
you're starting to work through and I
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
believe she said that this month you're
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
starting rfps on somebody that will help
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
you guys do that is that correct yeah I
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe the schedule is this month I'm
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
not in charge of the RFP process in that
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
in that way so I'm not sure exactly when
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
it will be released but yes that project
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
is in progress okay and the goal is six
 
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
to nine months that's what I believe she
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
said that's my understanding okay um do
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
either one of you have questions
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
specifically for the clerk go ahead um
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
forms and fees when fees are to be paid
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
how are they paid do they are they paid
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
somehow simultaneously with filing a
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
form you send us a bill do we wait to
 
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
see who wins and hopes the other one
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
gets stuck with court card how does this
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
work so the my name is Elaine low I'm
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the circuit courts in
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
Conway and oopy um also act as the case
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
manager in Conway um so the FI when the
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
forms are filed the filing fee is
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
required at the time of filing so we
 
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
either get a check cash or credit card
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
if a part is unable to afford the filing
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
fee then we offer a motion to wave that
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
fee um it's filed with a uh financial
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
affidavit and and then once the judge
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
reviews both and a ruling is made on the
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
motion to wave the filing fee it's
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
either accepted as um waved in full we
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
send parties a notice that part of the
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
fee is due or the motion is denied
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
completely and the case doesn't go
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
forward until the filing fee is
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
waved follow up um that's for the forms
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
what about a piece of evidence someone
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
has and wishes to say submit that is
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
there a fee to that there's a fee to
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
open a case there's no fee typically to
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
file into that case Okay so exhibits
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
evidence motions there are no no fees
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
for that type of so court costs then uh
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
does that apply in this state at this
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
level does it mean just the opening
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
filing the phrase court costs that one
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
hears I think often when people are
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
referring to court costs I imagine they
 
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:30.519 align:start position:0%
may also referring to any attorney's
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
fees that are related to the court
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
proceeding um but I would have to hear
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
it in context to be able to comment so
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
court cost may be fees to file or fees
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
to reopen the case um which may occur if
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
the case has been closed and then
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
someone files uh to change the parenting
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
plan or modify child support or
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
something like that after the case has
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
been closed thank
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
yes and so you work Direct IR ly with um
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
people that come in like prosay litigant
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
and stuff do they come in there now I
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
know that in conquer they had a computer
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
that they can come in and kind of sit at
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
and stuff are you approached with many
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions or do you find that people are
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
just kind of filling them out and
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
guessing and hoping they did it right or
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
do are people actually coming to you and
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
asking like what do I do with
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
this so it's probably um an even amount
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
of both most people come to the court
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
with their form to our courts mine at
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
least with the form completed um they
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
have some questions sometimes they'll
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
come to the counter I want to file for
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
divorce what do I need and we provide
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
them the forms but uh surprisingly a lot
 
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
of people show up with the forms um
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
partly completed Miss now are
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
you limited or what is your scope of
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
what you can advise someone on like if
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and says okay I'm
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
getting divorced and I don't know what
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
to do what is it that you've been told
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
that you should do like what are your
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
parameters for helping someone so of
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
course I can't I can't give them legal
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
advice right um but I can explain to
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
them how to fill out the forms okay
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
um the forms all work in conjunction so
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
a divorce for example PE uh litigants
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
are required to file Financial
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
affidavits the financial affidavit
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
information is directly relate um to the
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
final decree so any debts assets um has
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
to also be related related in the final
 
00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:32.990 align:start position:0%
to also be related related in the final
decree

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
decree
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
so that basically all I can do is tell
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
them here are the forms I I can help you
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
fill in the blanks with the information
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
you give me um but that's about what I
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
can do is there somewhere that you refer
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
them to like is there a specific place
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
on the computer or we have a list of
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
unbundled attorneys that we provide we
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a list of um legal referral places
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we send them to I mean we give them
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
the information when they file um and
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
then we refer them to mediation if um if
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
there are questions that I can't answer
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
a mediator can go a lot further than I
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
can in a case manager
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
conference and what about um do you
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
notice a particular pattern and
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
difficulties as far as when people come
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
in proos with forms not particularly not
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
in my situation at least you know but
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
Conway and oopy I would imagine bigger
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
locations where there's more money
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
involved um the the issues are a little
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
different but not in my particular
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
locations okay any
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
question representative B do you have a
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
that you're still putting out to bid for
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
help in
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
forms yes that's correct so I'm not sure
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
exactly when the RFP will be released
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's not released yet but yes but you
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
probably already have a list mental or
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
written of forms you would suspect would
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
be updated
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
yes we have about 1100 forms so it's
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's quite a list um and there are
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
certainly forms that we know uh people
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
have expressed difficulty around or we
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
know that they're complicated to fill
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
out even if we do need all the
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
information on them the financial
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit is a good example of that
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
where we we need all the information
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
requested but the the format could
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
certainly be improved the language could
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
certainly be improved so all of those
 
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
are the things that we're looking at in
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
this project as the um chairman of the
 
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.510 align:start position:0%
this project as the um chairman of the
special

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm happy
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
that some of the things we've
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
identified as areas of improvement you
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
folks are doing the same and that's
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful but before I say okay let's
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
declare Victory and go home uh just want
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure is there a way that we as a
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or as the entire special
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
committee can work with you during the
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
process uh because there are people who
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
use broad General nasty language and
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
then there are the occasional individual
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
who was a specific reference to
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
something I'm just wondering if we can
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
keep the lines open and work on this
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
together with what we know as outside
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
eyes and ears with you folks who live
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
with it every day yeah thank you and I
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
think um one of the valuable pieces is
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
that your work has done chairman is is
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
draw out some of the concerns and and
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
kind of label them in broader categories
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
and so if you've heard particular
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about some of the forums that
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
you'd be willing to share with us so
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
that we can uh look at that and make
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
modifications as is appropriate to
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
increase access that's that's what we
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
want to be continually doing um in our
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
process so if you have some of those um
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
areas for improvement that you've
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
identified we would certainly welcome
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
that um and we welcome anyone who has
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
used these forms or looked at these
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
forms and chosen not to use them because
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
they're complicated or confusing uh we
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
welcome feedback on those forms from
 
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
those individuals I intend to find a
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
half a dozen
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
individuals who are just starting
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
through this process and ask them to
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
give me feedback along the way that then
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
I can be that extra set of eyes and ears
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
with you folks but again this is just
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
one example of the general Co
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
cooperation my committee has found with
 
00:21:00.679 --> 00:21:01.549 align:start position:0%
cooperation my committee has found with
the

00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary um it's been
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
uniformly uh well first of all I I
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
approach this as a collaborative Venture
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
rather than an antagonistic one and that
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
beg got the same but also um the
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
willingness to say we're not perfect and
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
we want to make it better so let's work
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
together so that's been uniform so far
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm very grateful for that I've read
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
um minutes from other states where a
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
special Committee in the Judiciary
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
became highly antagonistic and uh we're
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
not doing that either side so thank you
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
so much well we're all dedicated to
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
increasing access to justice for folks
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm grateful for our opportunity to
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
do so together good so if I could have
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh would you be the one who would be the
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
ones making sure it's in a form of a
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
question who would be the ones that we
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
would call contact should we come up
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
with a specific once this process is
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
rolling uh names and contact information
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
who should we call I think the primary
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
contact has been the um AOC email
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
address I think that's been the the
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
filter because then um the
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts can
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
make sure the recommendation gets to the
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate trial court or Supreme Court
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
um for uh for forms uh review thank you
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and you'll Supply that to us
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
yes I will absolutely Supply that to
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
both of you and then also you do have
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
some you I think judge Ashley said that
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
you would be having public input how is
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
that going to work just so that when
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
people do come up we can kind of
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
reassure them yes that's part of the RFP
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
will be uh that who whichever entity we
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
engage with to uh do this work with us
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
would identify a way to receive public
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
input on the forms
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
um so I can't specify at this point in
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
time just because we don't know yet but
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
I imagine it would probably be something
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
like an email inbox or a public forum or
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
something like that um to receive input
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
and we receive input regularly from um
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
from individuals and also from Court
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
staff that see people tripping up on
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
things and make recommendations okay so
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's part of our ongoing process of
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
improvement perfect do either of you
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
have a question or any more input or
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
not immediately related to this but
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
while you're here um let's suppose this
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
is a hypothetical let's suppose an
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
individual uh now let me start with a
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
question when does small claims end and
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
begin in terms of suing someone for
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
money what what case constitutes a small
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
claims Cas yes
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes so uh Superior Court is is over the
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
$25,000 Mark Superior code is 25k and
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
above how about Circuit Court Small
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
10,000 is this why um I'm trying to make
 
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
sure it's an answer you can give me uh
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
is this why um I have heard that some
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
folks who were going to sue for 12,000
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
decided they didn't want to go to the
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
Superior Court dropped what they asked
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
for down to 9500 so as to keep it small
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
claims in Circuit Court does that track
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
with what some people might likely do um
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to what individuals might
 
00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
choose to do a but that's certainly
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
something that someone could do if they
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
chose to forgo an amount over $110,000
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
they could then file uh for a small
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
claims case in Circuit Court up to
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
$10,000 thank you very
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
much representative ball do you have any
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions or any more
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
comments okay can we take questions from
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yes honorable Betty gay do you
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you when I got a
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
divor years ago um there was Betty could
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
you come up to a microphone given your
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
you can go over to this side I I am
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
sorry that is not my place to do that
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'm gonna let that go
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know what to do yeah if
 
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:29.140 align:start position:0%
you could just turn that microphone on
 
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.470 align:start position:0%
you could just turn that microphone on
[Music]

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I was offered a prosay packet so I
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
was wondering do they still do some of
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
the courts that a person's going to file
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
a divorce in still have that option to
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
receive a packet which of course
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
contained forms not necessarily as much
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
instruction as might be handy but is
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
yeah how much is done to help prosay
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
people so we provide the forms T
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
typically people will come in and file a
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
petition for divorce um there are a lot
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
of forms we we try not to inundate the
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
petitioner with all the forms at once
 
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a lot so once we get the
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
service process done um we then schedule
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
a case manager conference or or
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
something we can um if it's a case
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
involving children we conduct first
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
appearance so that allows the case
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
manager to determine which path the case
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
is going to take at that point um at any
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
time that the proos say litigants want
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
all those forms we are happy to provide
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
them um usually we do that when uh
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
parties file joint petitions because
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're already in agreement to sign the
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
divorce petition so we provide all the
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
forms that they would need to finalize
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
their divorce um does that answer your
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
question that answer your question or do
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
you have a followup followup sure um you
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
were you're mentioning terminology that
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know I apologize so no no you
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
have to because that's part of the
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
procedure but is there any any
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
instruction sheet that says this is the
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
first step then here you have more steps
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
then here you have more steps more
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
options so that people have some idea
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
about what steps they will have to do so
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
as the process moves forward like right
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
from the beginning we if parties have
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
children then their once service is
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
accomplished we in the service packet is
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
all that information you can go to
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
mediation this is you know first it says
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
that you can go here's an option correct
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
here's your other option and and when
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
the cases where there are children
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
flowchart um that advises people where
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
the case could go from that point and
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
who which court handles that so the
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court provides um whoever
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
processes the divorce and initially will
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
parties I'm just trying to get a picture
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
of how extensive the uh outline is like
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
you say you get a flowchart so is the
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
flowchart pretty complete on on all the
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
potential paths you might take for cases
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
that involve children yes okay yep and
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
and that's available um it on the
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
Court's website and first appearance
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
video that is posted on the
 
00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:32.919 align:start position:0%
website yeah even the first all these
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
terms are so helpful to have them
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
defined in step one step two step three
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
or four yeah so we try to provide that
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
as the service packet goes out a lot of
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
that information goes to the parties
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome thank you
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
I did have one specific question that I
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
know somebody else on the special
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
committee had about the difference
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
between when you're going for a
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
protection or order where it was
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
stalking versus the form for stalking
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
versus the stor uh the form for domestic
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
violence or domestic abuse and I guess
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
the person that they knew had filed the
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
wrong one they should have filed now is
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
that something if they came up and they
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
they had these two forms that are kind
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
of confusing because it says based on
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
RSA which they might not know what the
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
RSA is and what that entails that they
 
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
could say this is my situation I don't
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
know which form to fill out is that a
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
question you can answer them or would
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
Point them how would you point them in a
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
direction to know which one to fill out
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
so we um advise all parties that come to
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
court to file either of those protective
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
orders we refer them we make an initial
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
referral to the um ad to the advocacy
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
groups the um because they can listen to
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
the story and figure out which form
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to pick and choose
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
which forms we can provide them each
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
form or both forms um and the court has
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
um those c those instruction forms on
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
the website that kind of dictate which
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
form you would file in in a different
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
situation that makes sense I'm glad to
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
hear that the first step is to you know
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
Point them to an advocacy group that can
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
kind of help them more with that I know
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's more complicated all right does
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
have so um I thank you for coming today
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
I know you took a lot of time out to
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
come here thank you so I think based on
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
what we heard from Judge Ashley last
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
week what we're hearing from them I feel
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable in saying that I don't know
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
that we need to do anything except for
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
just keep the lines of communication
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
open if we have a specific concern we
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
can reach out I will make sure that you
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
both have that email and we'll just keep
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
in touch with that does that work for
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
everyone yes all right thank you then I
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
will bam conclude this conclude this
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting thank you all so
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
