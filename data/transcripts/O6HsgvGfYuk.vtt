00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you esteemed
colleagues

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the smiling county government thank
 
00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
you for making time for me this morning
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
i will try to be brief and excited to
 
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
my fault my glasses fog up so i need to
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
so i come here today to speak to you
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
about house bill 1406 relative to
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
authorizing municipalities to collect
 
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.189 align:start position:0%
authorizing municipalities to collect
compost

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
compost
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that i think is important to
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
protecting our environment supporting
 
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
organic farming improving our state's
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
farm economies
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
creating alternative clean energy
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
sources and helping keep down
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
the operational costs that our
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
communities transfer stations
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
could see
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
did you know that approximately 40
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
percent of all food product produced in
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
the united states goes uneaten
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
composting is an environmentally sound
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
practice that benefits our society and
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
can save new hampshire money in many
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
ways when we dispose of this food waste
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
composting is a smart waste management
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
even the company casella has a new
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
composting program for anaerobic
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
digestion anaerobic digestion if you're
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
not sure what it is occurs naturally in
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
the absence of oxygen bacteria breaks
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
down organic matters and produces bio
 
00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.430 align:start position:0%
down organic matters and produces bio
gas

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
gas
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
this reduces the amount of material that
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
can go into a landfill and produces
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
biogas which can be used as an energy
 
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.830 align:start position:0%
biogas which can be used as an energy
source

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
so how does composting benefit our
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
society and save new hampshire residents
 
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
society and save new hampshire residents
money

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
we put less food waste in our trash
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
therefore folks that take their trash to
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
a transfer station will have to purchase
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
less purple bags or per paper bag
 
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.230 align:start position:0%
less purple bags or per paper bag
reducing

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
that waste reduces towns
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
transfer station tipping fees and
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
therefore reducing overall less solid
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
waste and
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
then those less tipping fees
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
will reduce costs for transfer stations
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
therefore hopefully not having to
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
increase property taxes to pay for town
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
operations like transfer station tipping
 
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.189 align:start position:0%
operations like transfer station tipping
fees

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
it also forges partnerships and
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
relationships with businesses focused on
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
utilizing composting like local farm
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
owners or organic food organic
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
growth by utilizing the compost which is
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
rich in nutrients or farms that utilize
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
compost for certain lives feeding
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
certain livestock
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
and lastly it reduces the need for
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
chemical fertilizers and helps create
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
healthier food in our growing system
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
composting and the utilization of food
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
waste is an action step that i feel is
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
based on the direction that we found in
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
some of the findings when this
 
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.029 align:start position:0%
some of the findings when this
house

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
asked the 2019 committee the report on
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee to study recycling streams and
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
solid waste management in new hampshire
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
and three of those findings were tied to
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
composting and food waste utilization
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
and it's an optional program that this
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill offers the
 
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.270 align:start position:0%
bill offers the
towns

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
it allows for the local governance so
 
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.070 align:start position:0%
it allows for the local governance so
that

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
local control can happen in every town
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
that feels appropriate whether to
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
utilize and allows for transfer stations
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
to have and their local
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
oversight board to decide if they want
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
to do this and if how and when they want
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
to engage in a compost program so i
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate you making time for me this
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for your your service
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
the towns need this is it re required
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
can't they do this right now whether
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
they have this bill or not
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
my post
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if you were fine done um
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
take food waste for compost what they
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
cannot do now is be authorized to enter
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
into an agreement with a third party it
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
a large company like casella to turn it
 
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
a large company like casella to turn it
into

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digestion like we talked about
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
it could be a local farm that says we
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
want to feed our
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
pigs and we'll manage the compost bin
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
for you so right now they can say hey we
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
want a compost but then they have to
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with it this would
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
allow them
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
with town control to enter into an
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
agreement with a third party
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
to execute it
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:22.469 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
so

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.189 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
there's a rule that
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't not allow them to do this that's
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
i can't understand why the town can't do
 
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.510 align:start position:0%
i can't understand why the town can't do
this

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
without the bill that's that's why i'm
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
maybe not clear of my question
 
00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:38.709 align:start position:0%
maybe not clear of my question
i

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
based on the rsa that i looked at it it
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
transfer stations to make an agreement
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
on composting it allows them to make an
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
agreement on reselling their aluminum or
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
their glass or their cardboard but
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
because composting hasn't really been a
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
modern way to reduce waste finally it
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
has people have realized the value of
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
composting food waste we haven't we're
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
basically up updating our our rsas
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
good morning representative egan and
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
um with the program like this whether
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
contracted out to a third party or the
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
town retains maybe a future current
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
program in composting
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
is the ownership of the compost always
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to be with the town or does that
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
also remain negotiable
 
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.310 align:start position:0%
also remain negotiable
per

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
an agreement with a third party
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
that would be in the agreement if the
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
if the town wants to endorse composting
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
and doesn't want to worry about it they
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
can say
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
local farm put a bin here
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
every tuesday you have to come pick it
 
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.670 align:start position:0%
every tuesday you have to come pick it
up

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
plain and simple if they want to say
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
company that's going to utilize this
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
compost in creating energy you're going
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
to create revenue from it can we have a
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
rev share that'll all be decided by the
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
town how they want to approach it that's
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
why this is an optional bill it allows
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
towns to option in
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
and then they can decide what's right
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
community thank you um is there anything
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
i guess my first question is how many
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
towns and cities already have a
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
composting program
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know i
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
i think part of
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
the idea is that they don't know if they
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
can or how they can execute it some of
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
them have it for
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
local composting for
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
shrubbery grass clippings but no one has
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
really talked about food waste because
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
you worry about there is always the
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
concern of okay we're come we're
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
compiling up food waste and we have to
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
collect it in a manner that's safe you
 
00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:56.949 align:start position:0%
collect it in a manner that's safe you
know

00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
high fat high high bin so that animals
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
can't get in
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
those type of things
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
so i think it's something that
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
towns are not aware that they can do
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
most composting is folks do it at home
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
they have a compost bin they have a
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
compost bucket they have a you know i
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a dirt trough
 
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.949 align:start position:0%
have a dirt trough
but

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
when i talked with neighbors about that
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
i have a trough for composting they said
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
well what if i live in more of a
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
suburban neighborhood and i don't i
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
can't do that or i don't want to do that
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
can't the town help me with that
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that's where the sort of the
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
generation of this bill came from that
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the idea that
 
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.829 align:start position:0%
and the idea that
we're

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
we should be looking for ways to put
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
less things into landfills into thinking
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
about building more landfills maybe make
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.949 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
um is my understanding with regard to
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
the bill's framework correct in that
 
00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:06.949 align:start position:0%
the bill's framework correct in that
this

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
this
bill

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore the question two
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
according to um
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
lines six and seven
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
the question to either
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
compost materials at the transfer
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
station or
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
to contract
 
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.350 align:start position:0%
to contract
so

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.690 align:start position:0%
so
will

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.790 align:start position:0%
will
[Music]

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
either or
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
activity be placed
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
on the warrant
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that this would be
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to do one or of the
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
or you know one or two of those
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
actions and that it would
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
be placed on the warrant correct it
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
would be enabling legislation that the
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
oversight board um some towns the select
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
board oversees the transfer station some
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
have the town manager that has to go
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
through the select board some have a
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
conservation commission
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
um for instance you know um folks that
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
i've talked with about this bill
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
bethlehem has a conservation
 
00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:08.389 align:start position:0%
bethlehem has a conservation
commission

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
so any of those towns would yes
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
have to put out a warrant or have a
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
public meeting to say we are going to
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
enable this alleged it's enabling
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
legislation you're correct and allow it
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
to happen and then specifics within that
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
um could you clarify
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
i understand the part that enabling
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislation it shall be voted upon in
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
via warrant
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
an article on the warrant
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
in your response or reply to my question
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
you also set a meeting that would not
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
just be like a regular monthly meeting
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
it would most definitely be an annual or
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
a special meeting correct a special
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
meeting or a town or or the annual town
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
meeting when warrants would go on
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry for my
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
 
melvin

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a small municipality and we have a
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
we have a transfer station but we also
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
compost leaves
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that can we put that
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
stuff in the uh
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
compost pile that we have now
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
that would be the decision of the
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
transfer station on how they want to
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
manage it and and
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
i think most of them would have a
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
separate area for food waste
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:44.150 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
um

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
what i would call cuttings waste you
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
know leaves uh branches
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
grass clippings um sometimes they like
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
to have them separate
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
just to basically manage
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
for you know
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
animal issues
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
i'm a great believer in recycling
 
00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.470 align:start position:0%
i'm a great believer in recycling
um

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware that approximately 25 to
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
30 percent
 
00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.310 align:start position:0%
30 percent
of

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
of
the

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
waste that goes into a transfer station
 
00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:20.069 align:start position:0%
waste that goes into a transfer station
is

00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes this is one of the reasons why this
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
bill is important to me um okay
 
00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:31.509 align:start position:0%
bill is important to me um okay
follow-up

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of russian red
 
00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of russian red
wigglers

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
russian red wigglers
 
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.030 align:start position:0%
russian red wigglers
are

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
russian worms
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
that do nothing but
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
breed and eat
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
and they just multiply like crazy
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
and they eat food waste and turn out
 
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.509 align:start position:0%
and they eat food waste and turn out
compost

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
compost
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
very rapidly
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
they're a wonderful thing i've i've had
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
many in my life
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm a great believer in it
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
no thank you for that information i'll
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
i'll keep that in mind when if and when
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
this bill passes um to share that with
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
the town transfer stations that that's a
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
a way to utilize
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
the compost and process it
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
okay are there any more questions for
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
this witness
 
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.790 align:start position:0%
this witness
representative

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative thank you my question i
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
apologize if this is redundant to
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative powers question but i
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
can't get my head completely wrapped
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
around the or
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're allowed to i'm just curious
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
why it's on an and in that sentence
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
where it says it may collect
 
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.069 align:start position:0%
where it says it may collect
or

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
may contract why why wouldn't we want
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you want that to be an and
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
in there so that you have both of those
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
things because it seems like then going
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
to the warrant
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
we may be asking for one or the other
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
rather than both together which makes
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
this the the the i think the goal that
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
you would like just to i did not want to
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
i want to give towns local control and
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
figure out how they wanted to do that
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
and if they felt that they had an
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
aggressive compost program that the town
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
could reutilize the resources they want
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
to fertilize their ball field or they
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
have um i'll use my example in grafton
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
county we have a county farm
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
could all the towns say this is a way we
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
want to help reduce costs to the county
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
and we're going to send them our compost
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
and the town will collect it themselves
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
or work with the county to to get it
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
picked up
 
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.430 align:start position:0%
picked up
or

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
work with a third party vendor like a
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
casella or a local
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
organic farm or a local livestock farm
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
who will come and manage or manage it
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
for them i did i wanted to be able to
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
give transfer station
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
directors an opportunity to say
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
i like i want to do this but i don't
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
have the time or manpower
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
let me offload it to a third party
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then again last part i want to make
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
sure that the town knows best what's
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
good for their community so let their
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislative organization usually select
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
board that oversees a transfer station
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
let them decide
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
how we want to do it and who we want to
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
any else questions
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
is do you
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
while i understand that any type of a
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
program to compost or contract
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
shall be determined by the legislative
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
body of the municipality do you happen
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
to have any estimates
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the costs that
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
might be incurred as a result of a town
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the municipality as a result of a
 
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.789 align:start position:0%
to the municipality as a result of a
town

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
participating in such an endeavor
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
no because we haven't really done it
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
before i have there's not a lot of data
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
to follow up on uh representative
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
power's question
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
one of the possibilities for
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
composting that my town has researched
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
is a third party
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
would come in and manage the compost and
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
not count itself
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
and then what it does is
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh is that your understanding that what
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
that would do is reduce the
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh we as a pay-as-you-throw system so
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
would that reduce the cost of
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
the blue bags or whatever color bag
 
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:53.830 align:start position:0%
the blue bags or whatever color bag
right

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
actually would have a double reduction
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
it would reduce cost to to taxpayers
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
to or constituents to buy a bag you know
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
if you can if you can say great
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
let's just use the the
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
national numbers if 40 of my waste is
 
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.750 align:start position:0%
national numbers if 40 of my waste is
food

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
then i use up
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
i can take 40 out of my blue bag or
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
purple bag and put it in composting so
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
that saves the
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
consumer money
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
but also if the composting is then
 
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.390 align:start position:0%
but also if the composting is then
third-party

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
third-party
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
utilized that's less that's going into
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
the dumpster and to the town's tipping
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
fees to a landfill so now it's reducing
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
costs for all taxpayers whether you
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
compost or not and the town this was the
 
00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:37.830 align:start position:0%
compost or not and the town this was the
idea

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
of giving them an opportunity to explore
 
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.669 align:start position:0%
of giving them an opportunity to explore
this

00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
um so that actually they could save
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
themselves money and if they
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
third party have some type of revenue
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
generation then they're making money on
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
stuff that they normally were spending
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
money to get rid of
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
question representative egan
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
you may remember from the hearing of hb
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
1185 yesterday
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the town of merrimack composts its
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
sludge from its wastewater treatment
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
center we take sludge from
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
the state through from the franklin
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant and from many
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
communities surrounding merrimack
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
would you believe that that is composted
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
with sawdust and we make nearly a
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars off of that every year
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
we contract with a company that sells it
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
as soil amendments for golf courses and
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
parks and all sorts of places so i'm
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
very excited about this bill
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a huge
 
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
i'm a huge
home

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
composter as well i have it down to a
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
science so thank you for bringing it i
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh to answer her question i i would be
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
excited to know i would not i would not
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
be surprised to know that it's a million
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
dollars um i did have the pleasure of so
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
i do have the pleasure of serving on uh
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
as well fish and game on resources
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
recreation development where we had a
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
conversation about sludge compost mixed
 
00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
conversation about sludge compost mixed
with

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
sawdust and potentially
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
this could also this opportunity could
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
solve other problems for loggers with
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
chipwood in the north country who are
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
struggling to figure out since we don't
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
have biomass plants anymore how can we
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
monetize our chipwood the leftover waste
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
wood when they make logs so i'm not
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
surprised by this i think we're we're
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
modernizing the way that we try to
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
solid waste and i think it's a
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
important thing that we're doing for our
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
constituents and it's a point thing that
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing for our environment and it's
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
an important thing for new hampshire so
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
i hope i answered your question i
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
um i have one um
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
i maybe i missed something that you said
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
on here but the cost of
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
running the compost and i i think you
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
may need a uh an employee
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh or whatever the other costs would be
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
do you think they are well worth the i i
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
believe in this but do you think they
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
were well worth
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
the effort to create one i
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
did not go into this lightly i spoke
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
with the transportation directors in my
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
district at franconia which is franconia
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
easton and sugar hill i spoke to the
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
transfer station director in lisbon
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
lisbon lyman
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
landaf i spoke to the transfer station
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
director in littleton which isn't even
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
my district but it's sort of my local
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
community um and and they don't actually
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
have a transfer station but they have a
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
trash management person in the town of
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
monroe which is also my district they
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
all said that if we were able we're
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
already separating out
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
the trash
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
paper cardboard bottles cans
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know you pay for electronics we're
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
already doing this so the manpower is
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
already there it's another bin that we
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
have to set up
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
and if we're given the option that
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
someone else can
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
bring the bin in
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
come pick it up empty it bring it give
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
us a fresh bin
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
then we don't even have to worry about
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
it like we have to package up the
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
cardboard package up the paper
 
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.950 align:start position:0%
cardboard package up the paper
so

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
it does have a
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal benefit for the town
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
without adding
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
to their manpower they're already on
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
site doing this it's just another it's
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
another thing that the consumer the
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
resident has to separate
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%

hampshire municipal association and i'm

here to support this legislation i don't
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
want to repeat any compelling testimony
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
that representative egan has already
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
given however this does expand local
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
control and clarifies the law to allow
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities to engage in this
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
composting activity if they choose to
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
dozens of municipalities are already
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
looking to do some form of this or
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
engaging in some local form of this or
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
researching it as an option to reduce
 
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.149 align:start position:0%
researching it as an option to reduce
landfill

00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
costs and offer more environmentally
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
friendly options to their community
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
i don't pretend to be an expert in
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
transfer station management but i do
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
know there's best practices and
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
modernization that's constantly being
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
looked at in order to have a more
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
sustainable landfill in the future for
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
our residents as well as save money for
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.950 align:start position:0%

thank you ms hicken thank you for taking
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes is the new hampshire
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
municipal association in a position or
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
do they have resources to support
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
communities that want to start a
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
composting program
 
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.630 align:start position:0%
composting program
we

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
always have resources to help them
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
through the legal process of working
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
through the legislative you know the
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
warrant and the town meeting as well as
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
putting him in touch with resources such
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
as other transfer stations who might be
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
further along in the process
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
and putting those people together and
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
having discussions so that people can
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
learn from one another and as some
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
communities will be further ahead in
 
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.230 align:start position:0%
communities will be further ahead in
this

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussion whether it's locally or
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
they're already engaging in some form of
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
local composting and we always do put
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
our members together to help them
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
through these types of
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
new changes to the law
 
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.029 align:start position:0%
new changes to the law
welcome

00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
could you tell me or do you have an idea
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
how the municipalities would handle the
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
maggots the flies and the bees
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry sir i do not i am not a
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
transfer station
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
expert or a composting i do do it at my
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
home but i'm not an expert in that area
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
however i do know there are best
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
practices and nationwide this is a
 
00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:30.549 align:start position:0%
practices and nationwide this is a
growing

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
trend so i think there are best
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
practices around that and i can
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
certainly help find the answer to that
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
nork
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
representing the solid waste management
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
bureau at the new hampshire department
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
of environmental services
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
i serve as the agency's expert on
 
00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.630 align:start position:0%
i serve as the agency's expert on
composting

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
composting
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm also heading up a current project to
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
rewrite the composting regulations for
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
the state um and so i thought i'd
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
provide some uh information for the
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh just we're not taking a
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but i just wanted
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
to clarify a few things i i recognize
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
that there were some questions from the
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm happy to
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
take further questions um but
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
just one point i wanted to clarify in
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
this does not add new
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
in our view this does not necessarily
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
add new
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
authority for municipalities it simply
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
clarifies the statute because there are
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
already municipalities engaging in this
 
00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:16.230 align:start position:0%
already municipalities engaging in this
activity

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
the statute rsa149m which is the solid
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
waste management act that's the that's
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
the statute that we administer in the
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
solid waste management program at des
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
that statue
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
already states in rsa 149 m17
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that a municipality has the ability to
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
sort and separate its waste and create
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
bylaws to
 
00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:41.430 align:start position:0%
bylaws to
essentially

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
run its transfer station manage its
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
solid waste within its jurisdiction it
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
also has language that potentially could
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
be updated but currently it says that
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
the the town may enter into a contract
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
with a hauler or a disposal facility
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
for disposal of solid waste
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
we've been interpreting that pretty
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
broadly to mean that they could entered
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
a contract with a recycling company they
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
could enter into a contract with waste
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
management casella you know any of these
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
companies that run landfills
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
and also with composting operations and
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
there are municipalities
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
that do
 
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.230 align:start position:0%
that do
currently

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
contract with
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
composting companies to pick up compost
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the town or to work with
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
their transfer station where it's
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
collected and then that company comes in
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
and takes it to their composting
 
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
and takes it to their composting
facility

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things i want to clarify
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
this bill does not
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
actually create
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
additional composting infrastructure in
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
the state and that's where our biggest
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
challenge is in the state we currently
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
have i believe
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
10 permitted composting facilities in
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and when i say permitted i
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
mean they are permitted as
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
facilities that can compost food waste
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
the facilities for example represent
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative melvin had talked about
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
the town already compost leaves and yard
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
waste that's
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
not regulated by des
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's a permit exempt activity there's
 
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.110 align:start position:0%
that's a permit exempt activity there's
no

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a solid waste activity um
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
because of a
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
little quirk in the statute it actually
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
exempts that activity
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
um but for composting of solid waste
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
which includes food waste
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
we do regulate that and any facility
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
that receives food waste
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
to compost would need to be permitted by
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
our agency
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
so that's the challenges is we don't
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
currently have enough infrastructure in
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
the state to handle all the food waste
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be diverted
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that we are
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
trying to do is revise our composting
 
00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:41.110 align:start position:0%
trying to do is revise our composting
regulations

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can hopefully make the
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
permitting process a little bit clearer
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
simpler and easier for folks to approach
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
so that they can hopefully
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
develop more infrastructure in the state
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
so those are the points i just wanted to
 
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.590 align:start position:0%
so those are the points i just wanted to
clarify

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing i believe representative
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
melvin had asked about how do you manage
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
you know pests like flies
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
rodents birds
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
the composting process is both an art
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
and a science
 
00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:11.509 align:start position:0%
and a science
and

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
part of it is just really it's about the
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
management of the process and so as long
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
as you have all the elements in place
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
for an uh what's known as an aerobic
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
composting process
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
that will actually
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
reduce the chance that you
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
create odors attract
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
pests and you know create potential
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
you would be creating nuisances for your
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
neighbors and things like that so it's
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
really about how you manage the process
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
and making sure that you have the right
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
balance of materials it's really about
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
the recipe and how you manage it
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave it at that if if there are
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
any further questions that i might be
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
able to answer i'm happy to do that i
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
don't have any written testimony okay
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions i'm representative wrong
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr norton thank you for taking
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
my question you talked about the des
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
permits composting facilities
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
can you give me some examples of the
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
criteria of that and specifically
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
would a composting facility that exists
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
at the merrimack wastewater treatment
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
plant would that qualify to take food
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
waste or is it or is that
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
the the permitting process for
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
composting distinguish between the type
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
of waste that's being composted like
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
biosolids versus food waste
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wrong that's a
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
great question um
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
just like leaf and yard waste composting
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
is not regulated by us sludge composting
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
is also
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
not regulated by our program that's
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
actually regulated by
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
the water division at the es because the
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
sludge is a result of
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment processes
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
so that's actually a separate permitting
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
process which is through a different
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
program at the es is the the residuals
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
currently

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
how this works is a facility that
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
already composts sludge if they wanted
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
to add food waste
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
it would require
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
coordination between our programs to
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
the facility is
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
operating in compliance with both the
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
rules that govern sludge composting and
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
also the rules that govern food waste
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
composting because they are separate
 
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.589 align:start position:0%
composting because they are separate
programs

00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
in practice
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is not something that happens in
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
the industry typically
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
partly because sludge composting and
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
food waste composting they try to keep
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
those things separate primarily because
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
the end uses can be very different
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
sludge composting is going to have
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
more restrictions around where it can be
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
used just because of the nature of how
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
it concentrates heavy metals and other
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
things that could be a potential concern
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
for human contact
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a more stringent
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
process for sludge composting
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
and food waste composting has a separate
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
set of criteria
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you had
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
commented that composting is an art as
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
well as a science
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
my question is what resources are
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
available to municipalities
 
00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
available to municipalities
who

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
might choose to
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
effectively and safely collect compost
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power that's a
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
great question that's one that we get a
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
lot and one of the things that's been
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
challenging for the department is
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i feel like i'm a brokered record
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
when i'm in front of environment and
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
agriculture because i have to
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the resources that the
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
department itself has are very limited
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
for outreach and education
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
that is part of our charge but it's been
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
something that we're challenged to do
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
just because we've been
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
subject to a number of budget
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
constraints over the years
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
we do what we can we also work with
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
other partner organizations in the
 
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.270 align:start position:0%
other partner organizations in the
region

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
region
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
such as the northeast resource recovery
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
association or nra which is actually
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's a organization that works with
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities throughout new hampshire
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
and also throughout new england
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
on recycling and waste waste management
 
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.550 align:start position:0%
on recycling and waste waste management
issues

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
we also partner with other regional
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
organizations like the northeast
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
recycling council which has been trying
 
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:22.870 align:start position:0%
recycling council which has been trying
to

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
promote composting
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
more broadly
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
i actually serve on the board of the
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
northeast recycling council so
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's a great networking
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity and that organization also
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
provides information and
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
connects folks with a potential
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
consultants or other resources that
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
might be available to help them with
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
kind of the technical aspects
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
long term one of my goals would be for
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
the department to be able to take a more
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
central role in that
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
but we are slowly trying to build up a
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
program that would allow us to do that
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay make it quick because we're a
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
little bit behind
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
um with regard to you had
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
because this type of composting is is
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
food or solid waste composting it is and
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
requires a permit by your
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
does that also
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
imply that there would be some type of
 
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.310 align:start position:0%
imply that there would be some type of
inspection

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.430 align:start position:0%
of these
operations

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah as a permitted facility they
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
would be subject to audit to inspection
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
as necessary
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we necessarily
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
do on a routine basis but if there's an
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
issue or a complaint we may investigate
 
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.470 align:start position:0%
issue or a complaint we may investigate
it

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.430 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
anything any facility that's kind of
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
under our jurisdiction
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
that that would be you know a
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
we try to we try to regulate these
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know education rather than through
 
00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:02.630 align:start position:0%
you know education rather than through
enforcement

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay is there any other questions for
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
this witness
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
time

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that would like to
 
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.109 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that would like to
testify

00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
i see none i close hearing 14 house bill
 
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.150 align:start position:0%
i see none i close hearing 14 house bill
1406.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
1406.
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
and we are running behind so i'd like to
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's my thing sorry do you want me to
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
hand it to you
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative duchess would like
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
to introduce you bill yep uh thank you
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you to the committee
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
for uh for entertaining me this morning
 
00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:06.870 align:start position:0%
for uh for entertaining me this morning
um

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce a bill i prime
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
sponsored house bill 1055. this
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
legislation is very simple the bill
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
increases the income and asset
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria for the property
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
tax exemption for disabled persons and
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
for deaf or severely hearing impaired
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
persons the adjustment for income and
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
asset eligibility criteria for the
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
property tax exemption set fourth in
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1055 is based upon the rate
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
of inflation from 2008 to 2021. 2008 was
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
chosen as a beginning year because
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's when the rsa was last changed and
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
i chose 2021 because that was when i
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
wrote the bill last year and that's the
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
numbers for inflation that we currently
 
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
numbers for inflation that we currently
have

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
i would also like to recommend an
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to the legislation um
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
that i had drafted from ols it would be
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
um adding language to change the 15 000
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
figure in rsa 72 colon 37 which
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
regulates the exemption for blind
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
individuals uh change that fifteen
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar figure to twenty two
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year which would be
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
the same exact adjustment for inflation
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
from 2008 to uh 20 i believe actually
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
was 2003 to uh yep based on inflation
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
from 2003 when rsa 72 colon 37 was last
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
amended to 2021. i overlooked the the uh
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
the blind tax exemption when writing
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
1055 and only considered individuals
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
with disabilities or those who are deaf
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
or severely hearing impaired lastly i
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
believe the overall cost of the tax
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
burden shifting will be so many school
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
that property taxpayers will either not
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
be affected or will not even be noticed
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can look up the number of
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
communities that offer this tax
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
exemption and the number of individuals
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
who take advantage of it and typically
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
it tends to be each community maybe a
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
handful of people so any kind of a
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
increase would not create an overall
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
burden for the entire community
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
and to help mitigate any of these
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
possible costs too i made the
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
legislation go into effect on january
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 and i gave communities a three
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
years to phase in potential costs just
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
as the legislation was originally
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
written and originally implemented back
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
about a decade and a half ago and um
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
with that i'll remain open to any
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions and mr chairman after if you
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't mind if i submit the amendment to
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
you absolutely you can submit that to
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
the clerk thank
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
our you power
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
so um my question pertains to lines 25
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
and 26
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill bill language
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
so according to the 2020 exemptions and
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
tax credits summary report
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
authorized by the new hampshire
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
municipal and property division
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
residency requirements to be eligible
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
for all other exemptions and tax credits
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
is either three or five years
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
could you please explain what is your
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
rationale for the proposed change from
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
at least um
 
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.069 align:start position:0%
at least um
five

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
for at least five years to at least one
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
year yeah but thank you for asking the
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
question representative and i should
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
have touched on that my testimony and
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
part of my reason was because if someone
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
has moved to the state and bought a
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
house and owns a home and has lived here
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
as a full-time resident for a year i
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
feel as if they're pretty involved in
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
the community that they're going to be a
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
long-term taxpayer in the community and
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
i also felt as if the five year i
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
believe it was five years yep the five
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
years that was required before was a
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
large barrier to people
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
who have disabilities uh from moving to
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state or from retiring in this state
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
um there really is uh the five years
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
seem to be a fairly arbitrary number
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
that was originally established in state
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
statute i feel a year is more than
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
enough time to really determine if
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
someone's going to move to a community
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
full time be a full-time taxpayer there
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
and be a full-time contributor in that
 
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.430 align:start position:0%
and be a full-time contributor in that
community

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit more full fully what leads
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
you to believe that a year is enough
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
time to tell if somebody is going to be
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
a long-term member of the community
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
what's your thinking behind that
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
well i would assume in in my in my
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
assumption i would assume if um
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
if someone is going to take the time to
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
search out a community
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
to you know possibly hire a realtor to
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
help them either buy land and build a
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
house or to buy a house and then to you
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
know completely move their entire family
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
or you know whoever is in their living
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
unit with them to a new community and to
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
essentially you know establish residency
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
there i would find that you know if
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
you've done that whole process and then
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
spent a year right declaring a place
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
here uh your residence i would feel as
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
if you know someone's probably fairly
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
well committed to uh to that community
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
probably really enjoys it is probably
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
very excited to stay there and to be a
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
a part of that community
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative majori
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question i
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
think i'm kind of a broken record on
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
this but i'm reading down and i
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
apologize my bill doesn't have the line
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
numbers on it but it's uh number three
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
present a procedure for adoption
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
and in there it talks and this isn't a
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
change of the bill this is existing
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislation it says the net asset
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
amounts provided in sections one and two
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
this act
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh maybe phased in over a three-year
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
period so i go back to the question that
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
was asked before
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
do you see any issue with a community
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
that is allowing for one year when the
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
phase in is three years
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't there be should there be
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
some consistency there
 
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.829 align:start position:0%
some consistency there
um

00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for for areas where
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
that could be a problem for a community
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
does the question make any sense
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the question does make uh that
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative and um how i would kind
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
of think about it is um if if a
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
community so obviously people can
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
already qualify for this tax credit
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
right and so the three years of phased
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
in would be the uh the max amount so
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
someone all this would do would say the
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
current tax credit that people could
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
already qualify for that they would be
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
able to qualify you know in the first
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
year and as communities phase into the
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
full tax credit right um
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
you know then people would the people
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
who had already qualified in the one
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
year for the current tax credit but then
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
eventually over you know the time period
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
the three years that's phased in within
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
phase in for the full tax credit right
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
so it just would get more people you
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
know taking advantage of the tax credits
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
sooner right now maybe it wouldn't be
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
the full amount of the tax credit of
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
what this bill will have municipalities
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
doing three years down the road but it
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
just will get more people you know into
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
the tax credit
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions to this
 
00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:50.470 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions to this
witness

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i'm pretty sure
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken off my memory um i'm
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's based on the
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
community's decision but i could be
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
mistaken on that so i'll i'll write down
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
that and i'll uh i'll get back to you to
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
see how much communities have discretion
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
over it it's a set amount
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
if i may i'm sorry
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes if i could thank you mr chairman
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is usually when it's an
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
exemption it's a set figure i just
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to know how much of an impact
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
this would have
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh if it was
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
it when it is adopted
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
well i think um as for impact it really
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
depends on the community and how many
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
people take advantage of it but i agree
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's that figure would be
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
very important to know so i'll be sure
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
to follow up with an email and get back
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
to your representative thank you
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you mr chairman are
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
there any other questions representative
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
taking my call
 
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.990 align:start position:0%
taking my call
um

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'm an alderman in nashua and every time
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
i see something about exemptions my
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
my hackles go up because i i know this
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
gets passed on but in looking at your
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
particular bill here because you're
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum some place like
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
nashua has um on the on the disability
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
um fifty thousand and a hundred and
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand for for assets so this
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
would not affect us and
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
where our exemptions um
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
i i i know for our i think our blind our
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
blind exemption is 94 and 194 000 for
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
for disability
 
00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:43.510 align:start position:0%
for disability
um

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
i guess my question to you is do you
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
know offhand
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
how many municipalities will be affected
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
by this so as i said the the city of
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
nashville would not be affected by
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
by your bill here but do you know how
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
many i know the dra puts up
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
an alpha list of every single community
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
county etc have you looked at that and
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
seen which
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
what communities will be impacted by
 
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.270 align:start position:0%
what communities will be impacted by
this

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of well i've gone so i have
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
gone through the dra list and um it's
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's kind of tough to tell because you'd
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
have to look at you know the local
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
community's budgets and how much revenue
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
they collect
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of it's pretty
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
indeterminate it would be you know each
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
community and you know i would encourage
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
representatives to look at how it might
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
affect their community by going through
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
those dra
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
numbers and contacting their budget
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee or their board of selectmen to
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
really kind of go through that but i'd
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
say for the most part because of the
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
number you know how small of a
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total population in
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
each community what actually takes
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
advantage of this tax exemption um
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
it would be almost minuscule tiny onto
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
the total revenues of the community
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair go ahead which
 
00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:52.790 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair go ahead which
follows

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
follows
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um i guess i i worded it wrong
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
i i haven't
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
gone through every
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
income of it i guess what i was asking
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
are are there any communities right now
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
that are literally just within the state
 
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
that are literally just within the state
minimum

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
that would have to raise this i guess
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's the question oh yeah i mean yeah
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's a number of communities i
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the exact number of
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
communities but yeah there are there are
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
there are some communities that you know
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
have a lot more of um of you know of the
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what's the word i'm looking
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
for of um
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
being able to like and have someone into
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
the program but there are some
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
communities that do use the uh the very
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
bottom number and have since the statute
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
was you know last last updated in 2008
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
and for the blind exemption 2003. so um
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think the overall purpose of this bill
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
though is that if communities have
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
adopted that program that because of
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
inflation over the last 15 years you
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
know we should make sure that their
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
adjustments made because there are
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
people who theoretically could have
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
previously qualified for this program
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
right and did and now you know we're 15
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
years later and they're either getting
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
very close to no longer qualifying or
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
they just no longer qualify anymore
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
just one quick follow-ups mister go
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
this still remains enabling it's not
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
going to force any of the communities
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
that don't have this type of um
 
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.190 align:start position:0%
that don't have this type of um
correction

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
correction
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah there's um there are
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
communities across the state that don't
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
that don't utilize this um if the
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
community decided that this adjustment
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
now is not right for their community
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
they could they could no longer offer
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
the exemption i will say though to that
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
note that was one of my concerns when i
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
first um you know when i wrote it
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
introduced it and then kind of thought
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
about it because obviously sometimes you
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
have that thought in the middle of the
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
night where you go well how would it
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
affect this um i spoke to the new
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire disabilities rights center
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire disability rights center
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
they support the bill and the amendment
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
and their concern regarding that point
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
was um very limited i brought that up to
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
them they hadn't even really considered
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
it but i said you know is this something
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
that um that could possibly concern you
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
if raising this makes communities less
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
involved in this tax exemption program
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
and they said that they didn't really
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
foresee that being a large issue
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
especially because they believed in
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
after them you know compiling some of
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
the dra numbers that it would be such a
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
small fiscal impact that most voters
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in an
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
uproar for something that probably
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even affect their overall tax
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh their tax bill thank you very much
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for this
 
00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.589 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for this
witness

00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
witness
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
okay sir mr representative thank you
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
very much your testimony thank you for
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
having me
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
do we have anybody else from the
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
audience who wanted to testify in this
 
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.270 align:start position:0%
audience who wanted to testify in this

who are concerned about masking i'm not
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask because i had covert a
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
my doctor tells me i have a very high
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm not wearing a mask
 
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.829 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm not wearing a mask

currently
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
number of people who come before you

with bills say this is really a simple
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
bill how many times have you heard that
 
01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.990 align:start position:0%
bill how many times have you heard that
okay

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
this is really a simple bill
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
existing rsa 670 colon 2
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
under the chapter 670 dealing with
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
village district elections provides that
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
voters in each village district elect at
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
an annual meeting
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
three commissioners
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
some officers but basically three
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
commissioners who run the district from
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
day to day
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a prior
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
modification of that
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
which allows
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the towns of merrimack and
 
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.789 align:start position:0%
the uh the towns of merrimack and
hooksett

01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
hooksett
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
to elect up to five commissioners if
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
in belknap county we have at least one
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
village district that is
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
limited to three
 
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.390 align:start position:0%
limited to three
commissioners

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the the practical problem is that
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's difficult to get a quorum
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
to get at least the two of those people
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
to show up particularly in the
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
wintertime when
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
people may be traveling out of state and
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:33.390 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of my bill is to
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:34.870 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of my bill is to
[Music]

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
modify 670 colon 2 sub a
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
which adds belknap county to the towns
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
of merrimack and hooksett
 
01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:45.029 align:start position:0%
of merrimack and hooksett
allowing

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
them all to elect up to five
 
01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:48.390 align:start position:0%
them all to elect up to five
commissioners

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that would then make it a little
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
easier to on a practical level to run
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
day to day
 
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
day to day
to

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
have a quorum and to conduct business
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
the interest of full and fair disclosure
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
i briefly served as a commissioner
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the water district in my town in
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
gunstock acres
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
until i was told that it was an
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
incompatible office that i couldn't
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
serve there and on the budget committee
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
resigned from the the village district
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
but the water district in
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
guildford acre gunstock acres serves
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
over 500 homes and two commercial
 
01:04:22.799 --> 01:04:24.230 align:start position:0%
over 500 homes and two commercial
establishments

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's got numerous wells pumping stations
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities etc etc uh and it's
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
a very complex computer system
 
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
a very complex computer system
and

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
it requires
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh people for whatever
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
relatively nominal pay they get to
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
service commissioners
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
to really one run the water system even
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
though there's a contract with a private
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
operator who runs a day-to-day the
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
commissioners do oversight and they make
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
decisions so this is this is as i said
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
pretty simple it just basically allows
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't require them but it allows them
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
to elect to
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
increase the number of commissioners
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
from three to five it's very simple
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
and as i said this is sort of the i
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
believe the epitome of a simple
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill and i'll be happy to
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
my question pertains to the language in
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
the bill on lines
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
22 and 23.
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
and specifically your amended language
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
states that for which the chain shall
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
take place
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
immediately upon receipt of the
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
requisite number of referring
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
affirmative votes for the proposed
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
change so my question is what is the
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
rationale for this language and and
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
stating that the the change shall take
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
place immediately and as opposed to
 
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.349 align:start position:0%
place immediately and as opposed to
the

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
current language in the bill in line 21
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
as stipulated
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
basically it's to
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
get the change done right away
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
they're short-handed and if they have to
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
wait for the next annual meeting
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
and it was basically if this passes
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
my what i would envision they would call
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
a special meeting of the district notify
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
all the voters in the district and then
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
make a proposal to adopt this change and
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
then elect two more commissioners if
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
they had to wait without that language
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
if they had to wait till the next annual
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
meeting they would still be they would
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
be shorthand for that period of time
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative silber for taking my
 
01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:40.870 align:start position:0%
representative silber for taking my
question

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
following up on representative powers
 
01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:45.510 align:start position:0%
following up on representative powers
question

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
this new language on lines 22 224 would
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
require then
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
the additional time and expense of
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
calling an additional meeting
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
since the affirmative vote would take
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
place at one annual meeting but if it's
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to be effective immediately
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
um there would have to be would there
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
have to be an additional meeting to
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
elect those that would be a special
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
meeting yes and the the only expense
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
involved would be
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
the notification by regular snail mail
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
which has not been very good in belknap
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
county recently
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
and elsewhere or by email there's a lot
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
of email uh basically uh in in this
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
particular district with which i'm most
 
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.190 align:start position:0%
particular district with which i'm most
familiar

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh virtually all of the residents who
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
are in the district have given their
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
email address and that's used for
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
notification of water outages and
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
notices of meetings and things of that
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
sort so it's really a fairly nominal
 
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.069 align:start position:0%
sort so it's really a fairly nominal
expense

01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and the meetings are typically held
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
at the guilford public library which
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
does not charge anything for the use of
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
the meeting room
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
um well i i represent merrimack which is
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
one of the communities we and and we
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
have five commissioners
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
why would not this bill address all
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
counties and give them the option
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not making it mandatory
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
they go to five commissioners it's still
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
they can adopt up to five is that
 
01:08:08.079 --> 01:08:09.109 align:start position:0%
they can adopt up to five is that
correct

01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
that is correct it is optional
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason that i drafted this the
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
way that i did was
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
i wanted to
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
try to make this
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
the possible as opposed to
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
trying to sweep
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
a very broad brush i was only dealing
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
with this was done at the request of a
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
constituent group
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
and i did not feel like i wanted to
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
drag other parts of the state into this
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
issue if they were not interested but if
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
if the committee
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
felt that this would be better
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislation just to
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
let everybody elect to have five
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
i would certainly support that
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
is the belknap county commission more
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
shorthanded than other county
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
commissions around the state
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is not the belknap county
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
commission this is the village district
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
pardon me is the village district
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
commission more short-handed than other
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
such districts in the state that was the
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
answer you gave to a previous question
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
do you know anything about other
 
01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:23.189 align:start position:0%
do you know anything about other
districts

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
all i can assume thank you thank you for
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
the question all i kind of assume is
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
that other than
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
the two towns that are already allowed
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
to go merrimack and hooksett
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
that everyone else is limited to three
 
01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
that everyone else is limited to three
and

01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard from anyone
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
of any other towns or any other
 
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.390 align:start position:0%
of any other towns or any other
districts

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
that we've got a big problem but maybe
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
they do and maybe they don't know how to
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
address it or they don't want to address
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
it i i can't
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
speculate on their motivation
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
but you know we all know that
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
serving as a commissioner on a village
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
district is basically a volunteer
 
01:10:02.159 --> 01:10:03.510 align:start position:0%
district is basically a volunteer
position

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard enough to get volunteers even
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
if they're paid something there's
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
usually not a lot
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the people who do volunteer
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
i would assume many of them
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
like some of my neighbors
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
leave during the winter time and they go
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
to florida or arizona or north carolina
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
wherever and during that period of time
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
during the heart of the winter which is
 
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.709 align:start position:0%
during the heart of the winter which is
when

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
pipes for example in a water district
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
when pipes break when you really need
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
action taken
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
they may not have a majority of you know
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
a quorum present if they only have three
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
commissioners so i but the answer is i
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer sorry
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
um i my question is about the mechanics
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
of how this works
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
if the village district chooses to
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
increase from three to five
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
where do those new candidates get voted
 
01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:01.669 align:start position:0%
where do those new candidates get voted
on

01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
how can it be at this at the same
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
meeting there would be an advertisement
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
it would be public notice of the meeting
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
as well as indicating that this meeting
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
was going to be held to consider
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
increasing and to accept
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
statements of interest or applications
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
for people wishing to be considered as
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
candidates would be done at the same
 
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
candidates would be done at the same
meeting

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine but if the
 
01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
that's fine but if the
um

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the village district
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
declines increasing to five
 
01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
declines increasing to five
then

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
they would choose from the five
 
01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:37.270 align:start position:0%
they would choose from the five
candidates

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm not sure
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
could you restate that for me please i'm
 
01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.430 align:start position:0%
could you restate that for me please i'm
sorry

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes if on the village district uh the
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
village district declines to increase to
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
five commissioners
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
five commissioners
um

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
and they're stuck with three
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay they're stuck with three but they
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
have five names to choose from i'm sorry
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
they're stuck with three but may have
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
five candidates to choose from but no
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
there was those three that they they go
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
into the meeting with three
 
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.709 align:start position:0%
into the meeting with three
commissioners

01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
those commissioners have typically have
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
staggered terms
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
the only time that any of those three
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
would be replaced potentially or
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
reappointed would be when their terms
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
expired so
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a special meeting call to to
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
vote on an increase from three to five
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
and it's voted down
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
they would just continue with the three
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
people until their terms expire
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
recently in the the city of um of
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
nashville we um
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm over here
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm looking around trying to find where
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
the voice is coming from
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
we recently tried to increase our border
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
health from three to five um we we ran
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
into um a problem with the current board
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
who felt that they worked really well
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
with just three and the reason we tried
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
to do it was because of much what you
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
said quorum was becoming an issue during
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
covid appointments and and so on and so
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
forth so my question to you is
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
how do the current commissioners feel
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
about having an increase of two more
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
bodies that they have to get approval or
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
non-approval or so on this this was
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question this was
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
specifically introduced by me at the
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
request of the existing commissioners at
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
least one of whom is here today
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
that answers my question and i saw him
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
raising his hand behind you because he
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
truly wanted to answer that so thank you
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
so much you're welcome
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
our representative
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i just want to make sure i'm not
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
seeing an inconsistency you say that
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
there there may be a special meeting to
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
do this and that the change would take
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
place immediately i think i understood
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
that correctly yes but as i read section
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
e and again i apologize for not having
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
line numbers but it's at the end
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
it says the additional commissioner
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
position shall be filled by a village
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
district vote at the annual meeting
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
is that inconsistent with the change
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would happen immediately or am i
 
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.310 align:start position:0%
that would happen immediately or am i
just

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
not understanding it correctly
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
which i always default to i don't
 
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.630 align:start position:0%
which i always default to i don't
understand

01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm married and i have three
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that i drafted this
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
but i asked ols to draft this
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.669 align:start position:0%
so uh
and

01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
there appear yes i can see where
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
01:14:48.239 --> 01:14:49.350 align:start position:0%
there might be
a

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh an inconsistency
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
except that you know we should go back
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the earlier section roman numeral
 
01:14:55.679 --> 01:14:56.790 align:start position:0%
to the earlier section roman numeral
four

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
that bellam county the change would take
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
place immediately upon receive the
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
requisite number of affirmative votes
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
for the proposed change
 
01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:03.910 align:start position:0%
for the proposed change
so

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
the change would take place
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
but then the so that then you would have
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
a five member commission with only three
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
appointed and then the next two would be
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
potentially appointed at the next annual
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
meeting that's what i would read it
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
question oh it does i just want to make
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure that i'm not misunderstanding it
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
because i could if i always default to
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm confused that somebody else might
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
be but usually it's just me no i i don't
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
think it's you in this case sir okay
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative silver i've been kind of
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
marinating on marinating on that same
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
section and i i do have an issue with
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
having it immediately enacted and
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
electing those additional two
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
commissioners at the meeting because
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong but i think
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
under present rsa there needs to be
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
notice for those positions before the
 
01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.390 align:start position:0%
notice for those positions before the
election

01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
but you can't notice them if they don't
 
01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.910 align:start position:0%
but you can't notice them if they don't
exist

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.149 align:start position:0%
exist
so

01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'd like your input or
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
your response to
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
approved immediately or enacted
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
immediately on majority vote
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
that those additional two commissioners
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
be appointed for the remainder of the
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
term that's described and then elected
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
at the following annual meeting the way
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
we fill vacancies now for town and
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
school positions
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
that might be a recommendation
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
i might
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know ask you to consider
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
so treat them
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
if it's approved for the additional two
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
treat those two as
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
positions that need to be appointed for
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
the remainder of a term until the next
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
annual meeting
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
i have a serious concern about adding
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
the um in merrimack anyway it's
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
expensive to have an annual meeting and
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
our village district we're lucky if we
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
get 10 people out of a population of 27
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
000 to go and that's for the regular
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
annual meeting if we had a special
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
annual meeting
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
i doubt we would get anyone there um of
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
course merrimack wouldn't have to do
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
that because they're already yeah we're
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
already at five already at five right
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i hope we are the only town that has
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty attracting people to our
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
village district meeting
 
01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.790 align:start position:0%
village district meeting
the

01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
the notice the public notice under 91a
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the special meeting it would be
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
posted in mail to all the members the
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
voters in the in the village district
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
would state that there's going to be a
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
special meeting
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
to consider increasing the number of
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
commissioners from three to five
 
01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:40.550 align:start position:0%
commissioners from three to five
and

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
anyone wishing to be considered for
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
appointment or election as a village
 
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.630 align:start position:0%
appointment or election as a village
commissioner

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
should submit their applications 48
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
hours prior to the meeting something of
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
that sort if you look at lines 25
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
it says if the village district votes to
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
increase the number of commissioners to
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
five and its commissioners serve
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
three-year terms at the first annual
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
meeting following the vote the village
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
district she'll elect two commissioners
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
for three-year terms
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
one commissioner for a one-year term and
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
then it goes on about the next annual
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
meeting so i think it's i actually think
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty well covered i don't
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be mechanically
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
now i've been to the
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
the village district that i am a member
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
of or a voter in
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i think we and we're probably lucky
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
to get 10 or 15 people
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
um the only time anybody shows up is if
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's a been a problem with the water
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
because it's a water system that
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
supplies residential water and if
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a problem with the water
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
system or they want to raise rates or
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
something like that then we'll get a
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
larger turnout but ordinarily
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i think the turnouts are fairly
 
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.270 align:start position:0%
and i think the turnouts are fairly
modest

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
modest
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%

01:29:48.880 --> 01:30:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
sorry

thank you mr chairman and fellow
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
representatives my name is jonathan
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
smith i represent carroll county
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
district five which is the towns of
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
effingham break out effingham brookfield
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
wakefield and
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
ossoffy i sent the whole committee an
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
email going back a few days i don't know
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
if everyone received it or has a copy in
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
front of them i don't know if it was
 
01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.669 align:start position:0%
front of them i don't know if it was
distributed

01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
was it mr chairman do you know i have a
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
copy i'm sure
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so this is a relatively simple bill
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
as you've just heard prior to me on my
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
previous speaker rsa 52 deals with
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
village districts
 
01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.629 align:start position:0%
village districts
um

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:08.639 --> 01:31:10.790 align:start position:0%
um
specifically

01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
the issue here is the dissolution the
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
former village district under 52-2
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
meetings to consider
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
it is a simple majority it doesn't state
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
that but by default it's a simple
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
majority because it doesn't mention the
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
vote count the dissolution vote requires
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
a two-thirds majority it specifically
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
states a two-third two-thirds majority
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
so my bill just changes two thirds a
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
simple majority
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh to make it even with the ability the
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
way it's formed in my opinion
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i am a selectman in my town i am the
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
chair of the board of selectmen
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i've had many people contact me in my
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh town alone we have three fire prisons
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
in the tiny town of 4 000 people
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to dissolve them now it takes
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
two thirds but when they were formed
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
many decades ago it was a simple
 
01:31:51.679 --> 01:31:52.870 align:start position:0%
many decades ago it was a simple
majority

01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.750 align:start position:0%
majority
so

01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
a government entity should never be more
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to dissolve than it is to form
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
like you i'm on the select board in my
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
town too and
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
we we have we have the constant
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
fees expenses that we have for different
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
things my question to you is when the
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
district was formed
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
way back when did they have those fire
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
districts those three precincts or or
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
did they have precincts within the
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
district and i i guess are the districts
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
within the precinct now or within the
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
village district now
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
each precinct is its own village
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
district each one each one correct okay
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand that yes
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and there's a town i just
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
elaborate there's a town north of me
 
01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
who has i believe seven districts
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
the same scenario and they're talking
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
about the same process how it's a burden
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
to dissolve okay thank you so for
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie thank you mr
 
01:32:55.199 --> 01:32:56.070 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie thank you mr
chairman

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your taking my
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
question i'm not i'm also a selectmen
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
but it's in hampstead we don't even know
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what reason what kind
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
of reasons
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
if you would why someone would want to
 
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.110 align:start position:0%
if you would why someone would want to
dissolve

01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
dissolve
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
a village district within its
 
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.629 align:start position:0%
a village district within its
uh

01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
within its town or i don't even know
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
if i could
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i don't even know
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
what the relation is to village
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
districts to the town in which it's
 
01:33:30.159 --> 01:33:31.510 align:start position:0%
districts to the town in which it's
located

01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
located
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
so village districts are used for many
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
forms for firefighting for water
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
impoundment and there's a whole gamut if
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
this is just the cover pace rsa 52
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
village districts there's probably 25
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
sections in here i'll have to look it up
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes yeah it's
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's a quite complex broad spectrum
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
of things that it covers
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
so an example would be you formed the
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
district to uh
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
and might use my example we have three
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
fire precincts these were formed decades
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
ago the town was uh
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
much simpler things were much cheaper on
 
01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.709 align:start position:0%
much simpler things were much cheaper on
today

01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:34:04.719 --> 01:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
today
the

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
firefighting is very complex it's very
 
01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.070 align:start position:0%
firefighting is very complex it's very
expensive

01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
so the idea of having three separate
 
01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.430 align:start position:0%
so the idea of having three separate
districts

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
dissolved and being able to form them
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
into one would in turn produce a much
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
more efficient way of of setting up
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
firefighting operations
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
i think that's just one small example
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
i understand i think a little bit and i
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
could did mr chairman thank you
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
in my estimation the establishment of a
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
village district as a governing body
 
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.270 align:start position:0%
village district as a governing body
is

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
not without significance it's a very
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
important thing
 
01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.109 align:start position:0%
important thing
so

01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
i understand your change from the
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
two-thirds majority to a simple majority
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
however if your purpose is to
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
align the vote threshold
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
to be the same to establish a village
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
district as it is to dissolve a village
 
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.189 align:start position:0%
district as it is to dissolve a village
district

01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know your thoughts and your
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
consideration with regard to
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
would you consider
 
01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
would you consider
um

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.149 align:start position:0%
um
having

01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:35:18.159 --> 01:35:19.590 align:start position:0%
having
both

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
the vote threshold to establish as to to
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
to dissolve to be two-thirds
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
because as i stated
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
it it's it's
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's establishing another body which is
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know governing
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers and the people could you
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
come could you respond to that yes um i
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
would not object to that for newly
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
formed village districts but again
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
you've got districts that were formed
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
decades ago
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
under different circumstances and to
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
change it to two-thirds to form
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't benefit dissolving the ones that
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um mr chair and thank you for
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my follow-up question so
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
therefore you'd be open to such an
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendment but however to grandfather um
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
pre-existing village districts
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
to to follow this um your simple
 
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.189 align:start position:0%
to to follow this um your simple
majority

01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with vote thresholds
 
01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.510 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with vote thresholds
yes

01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
my question
um

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
on line three and four where it refers
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
to the majority of its legal voters
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
that means of registered voters or of
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
the voters that came to vote that day so
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
i can speak to that also i did research
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
research that because that is always
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
brought up there is a case
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
62 sugar hill improvement association
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
versus lisbon there is case law that
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
it's only the voters that are actually
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
present and participating it's not the
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
total voting voting base
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry could you give me that
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
citation again sure sugar hill
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
improvement association versus lisbon it
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
was from 1962. that's referenced in the
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire planning land use
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
regulation 2019 2020 edition on page 76
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
you will see that reference
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you rep representative smith and
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
my concern with this bill is presently
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
for a bond to pass under a village
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
district it requires two-thirds vote is
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct okay now in
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
my in my community of merrimack we
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
passed a couple bonds a few years ago to
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
in to construct pfas filtration systems
 
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.189 align:start position:0%
in to construct pfas filtration systems
on

01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
four wells that were not covered under
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
an agreement with saint-gobain
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
and they were for
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
nearly 20 million dollars total
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
thankfully they they passed but
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
if a big decision like that
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
requires two-thirds vote
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
and weave now all this capital in our
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
village district millions and millions
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
of dollars of capital
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
why would only a sim if it took
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
two-thirds to to approve it and invest
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
in it why would it only take a simple
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
majority to get rid of it
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
to create the district itself right now
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
is a simple majority the bonding issue
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
is a separate issue every bond issued
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
requires a two-thirds vote or
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
supermajority by the people i think
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
monetary expenditures are
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
have a greater magnitude and impact
 
01:38:36.159 --> 01:38:38.550 align:start position:0%
have a greater magnitude and impact
immediately

01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
than the idea of dissolving the district
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
with a simple majority if the people
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
again to form the district was a simple
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
majority to dissolve it should be no
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:48.790 align:start position:0%
more difficult
it's

01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's like i said this bill is really
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
that simple monetary issues are
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
completely separate from the formation
 
01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.189 align:start position:0%
completely separate from the formation
and

01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
us dissolution chair
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a question for the
 
01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.109 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a question for the
representative

01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay thank you mr chairman but
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the dissolution also be have a
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
financial impact because now there is
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of capital that's
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
owned by the district but it only takes
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
a simple majority
 
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.430 align:start position:0%
a simple majority
to

01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
impact that investment
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
assuming it would be a divestment
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's no the decision is is not
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
something to be taken lightly it's gonna
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
have to be a serious discussion you'll
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
have your public hearings on it
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
um but again the bottom line is if when
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
this rsa was drafted and it stated
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
two-thirds to form i wouldn't even be
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
here talking to you i'm looking at it
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
from a point of fairness to the taxpayer
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
something that was formed 50 years ago
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
the present day taxpayer if they think
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's not being run properly should be
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
able to dissolve it as easy as it was
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
formed and that's why the simple
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
majority is the request okay thank you
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
this witness
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that would like to
 
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that would like to
testify

01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
i've seen none so i'm going to close the
 
01:40:06.639 --> 01:40:07.590 align:start position:0%
i've seen none so i'm going to close the
hearing

01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.109 align:start position:0%
hearing
on

01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1081
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock i believe is the next one
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%

01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%

01:51:46.000 --> 01:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.760 --> 01:54:12.629 align:start position:0%
 
research

01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.639 --> 01:55:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%

01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.599 --> 01:58:18.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.960 --> 02:00:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.199 --> 02:01:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
scary

02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:15.149 align:start position:0%
 
i've

02:01:15.149 --> 02:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee i have another uh bill in
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
another committee in
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
like 10 minutes so i'm going to be super
 
02:02:32.639 --> 02:02:35.910 align:start position:0%
like 10 minutes so i'm going to be super
quick

02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
the idea of this bill is that
 
02:02:40.159 --> 02:02:42.550 align:start position:0%
the idea of this bill is that
that

02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
when towns ask for money
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
for roads
 
02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:48.629 align:start position:0%
for roads
they

02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
do not
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh give
 
02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.430 align:start position:0%
uh give
the

02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
they do not ask the people
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
if they also want those roads to
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
be without
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
notice shut down or closed for any
 
02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.470 align:start position:0%
notice shut down or closed for any
reason

02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the townspeople
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
that shutting those roads down
 
02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:10.870 align:start position:0%
that shutting those roads down
for

02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
just by the request of some group or a
 
02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
just by the request of some group or a
person

02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
and not the entire town giving the
 
02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:17.830 align:start position:0%
and not the entire town giving the
approval

02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
is essentially and and those towns
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
granting that closure
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
is essentially
 
02:03:25.199 --> 02:03:26.550 align:start position:0%
is essentially
um

02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
saying we took the money so that you
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
could travel but then we're going to say
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
nope you can't use this now and you have
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
no say in that and so what i'm seeking
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
to do is give the town's people some say
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
and say uh give them the opportunity to
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
say you're not allowed to close down any
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the roads or sidewalks for you know
 
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
just because someone asked because they
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
want to stand there or do whatever they
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
want to do there's places that um in
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
town like parks and stuff like that
 
02:03:56.550 --> 02:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
which are for that purpose
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
but the purpose of roads is for
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
traveling not for shutting them down
 
02:04:00.639 --> 02:04:01.669 align:start position:0%
traveling not for shutting them down
um

02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so that this
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
this proposal would allow the people of
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
the town to vote on which roads they
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
would they would allow to be closed for
 
02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
would they would allow to be closed for
um

02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
and for how often
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
um you know how many days per year or it
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
would give them a lot of control over
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
which roads and for how long the roads
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
are going allowed to be shut
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
um are governing boards
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
compelled to provide uh permission for a
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
group to um
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
close a road for instance
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
i mean so what you're saying is that
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
governing boards
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
right now that decision to close a road
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
or sidewalk is not going to be their
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
decision it's going to be by vote of the
 
02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
decision it's going to be by vote of the
town

02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
so there there's a um
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
usually i think it's um you know these
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
permits are going to be issued by like
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
the town manager and there are some
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines for what for what would be
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
acceptable for approval so that they
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
don't run afoul of like free speech laws
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that we pick this person
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
can can
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know protest or have a block party
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
but not that person you know and so they
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
want to have
 
02:05:30.639 --> 02:05:31.589 align:start position:0%
want to have
um

02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:31.599 --> 02:05:33.750 align:start position:0%
um
something

02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
something
neutral

02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that they can grant those permits or
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
not and i'm saying that
 
02:05:40.239 --> 02:05:41.350 align:start position:0%
not and i'm saying that
that

02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
the town
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
really should be the first person to say
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to say
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
you know our
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
our uh residential street is not the
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
street to be shutting down um and if you
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
want to shut it down it needs to be on
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
this street you know the these many days
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
of the year and then the town can
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
if they have a request would be able to
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
grant that
 
02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:07.669 align:start position:0%
grant that
um

02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
that closure
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
so merrimack we have this
 
02:06:15.199 --> 02:06:16.550 align:start position:0%
so merrimack we have this
um

02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
the big event of the year is a little
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
league parade right and it's typically
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
um the last friday i think in um
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
in april
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
now there has been a time when we've had
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
to delay that a week because of weather
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
or something so are you saying that the
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
town the voters would have to approve
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
the first parade
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
but then they'd have to approve the
 
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.069 align:start position:0%
but then they'd have to approve the
rescheduling

02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
rescheduling
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
so so
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
all so the per
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
if if you're talking about
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
um the little league people are asking
 
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
for the road to be closed yes right okay
 
02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:52.709 align:start position:0%
for the road to be closed yes right okay
so

02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
so this wouldn't cover if it was like a
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
holiday parade because it's the town is
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
not issuing themselves a
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
permit right this is closure
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
from a requested third party like a
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
private party that's and
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
you are allowed
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
if you see in on lines
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
like 21 20
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to 25
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill or on the first page
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
you can
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
you can set a time frame you could set a
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
number of days you don't have to say it
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
has to be you know tuesday the 14th
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know every year
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
it could be you know you're allowed to
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
close it close this road one day per
 
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.629 align:start position:0%
close it close this road one day per
year

02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
right and so it wouldn't matter which
 
02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
right and so it wouldn't matter which
day

02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
they chose it would just be
 
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
they chose it would just be
um

02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
it would be a maximum of one day
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
but you could also i mean the
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
townspeople could also say we were we're
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay with you closing it for
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
up to seven days you know or something
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
like that and it would be
 
02:08:02.079 --> 02:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
like that and it would be
um

02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know then that
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
so what the towns people are doing are
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
saying okay we're going to put
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
this road in the hands
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the legislative or in the hands of
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
the governing body or oftentimes it's
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to be the town manager
 
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
or um that's actually issuing the
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
permits um
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
and they would have the flexibility to
 
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
say okay we're gonna do one day this day
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
one day that day
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then if there are requests for you
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
know eight days and they're only allowed
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
to issue seven days then they would have
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
to refuse that eighth day
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.159 --> 02:08:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:46.709 --> 02:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
02:08:46.719 --> 02:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
yeah i
so

02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
i live
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
in a city and
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that warrant
 
02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
articles are
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
more for
 
02:08:56.639 --> 02:08:58.310 align:start position:0%
more for
municipalities

02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
that are organized as towns rather than
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
cities i i mean
 
02:09:03.119 --> 02:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
cities i i mean
i've

02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
i've never voted on a warrant article
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
here as the resident of concord i've
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
never even been
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
noticed of one um
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
so my question is um
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
would this
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
would this apply how would this apply
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
equally to towns and cities and
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
um if not how
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
how are they supposed to do things
 
02:09:28.159 --> 02:09:32.229 align:start position:0%
how are they supposed to do things
differently

02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
um yes on page or on online 11 it says
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
the selectmen of the town or governing
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
body of the city may grant a license
 
02:09:42.079 --> 02:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
body of the city may grant a license
um

02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
so so yes it would be it would cover
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:52.069 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not as familiar with the um the
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
method for the people of
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
cities to
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
give give permission to their
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
their elected officials since i'm in a
 
02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.270 align:start position:0%
their elected officials since i'm in a
town

02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't
 
02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't
representative

02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman and thank
 
02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:13.589 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman and thank
you

02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative yokola
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
the question that i always have when we
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
get a bill is what's the problem that
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to solve
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
do we have a problem with towns
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily closing roads all the time
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
and making it inconvenient for people
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
what what is the problem that this bill
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
is trying to solve
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.199 --> 02:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
there

02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
there
in

02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll answer it this way i think
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:45.030 align:start position:0%
that um
the

02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
that the closure of roads
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
without the approval of the people
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
is essentially taking their their money
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
for roads and using it for another
 
02:10:56.079 --> 02:10:57.270 align:start position:0%
for roads and using it for another
purpose

02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
and so it's essentially fraud
 
02:10:59.599 --> 02:11:00.470 align:start position:0%
and so it's essentially fraud
and

02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:11:01.599 --> 02:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
the um
and

02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
while it may be an annoyance to some
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
people that this road is closed
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know um for one day
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
they may not
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
um it may not rise to the level that
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:17.589 align:start position:0%
they are
um

02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
make a big stink out of it every year
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
but if they were empowered to set
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines for the town they would be
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
interested in doing so um it from the
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
comments that i have heard um after
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
after submitting the bill that people
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
do get annoyed by the roads being closed
 
02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:40.950 align:start position:0%
do get annoyed by the roads being closed
um

02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
so i think that's
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that it
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
rises to the level of like i'm going to
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
vote you out kind of a thing but yeah
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:56.310 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
as i understand the bill you need to in
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
that warrant article you need to declare
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
the road
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
and roads and sidewalks that are going
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
to be closed so for instance in the town
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
of in my town where we have a race which
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
happens to be in a village district
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
um which is just funny but
 
02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:15.430 align:start position:0%
um which is just funny but
uh

02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
we would need to say we're going to
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
close road a b and we're looking for a
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
pool for a b c and d
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
but we also have alternate routes just
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
in case something happens based on the
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
area so we would need to delineate
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
all the potential roads to cover
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves is that correct
 
02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
ourselves is that correct
yes

02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
you would just say i mean you could have
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
the list every single road in town if
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
you were okay with every single road
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
being closed it's up to the town there
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
they can do whatever they want in their
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
town right so
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:50.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um thank you
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative for uh taking uh my my
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
call you you made a comment about that
 
02:12:58.159 --> 02:12:59.109 align:start position:0%
call you you made a comment about that
um

02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
the when uh representative van asked the
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
question about what was the problem
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's trying to solve you said need
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
some kind of comment about they take
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
money for road closure and use it use
 
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
that money for another purpose
 
02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
and therefore being fraud i don't know
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
if i quite understood that but don't we
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
kind of do this all the time for like
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
parking meters we use it for another
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
thing for
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
um lottery fun you know we do it for
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
other things and so on i mean
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
we set up these these funds sources
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly i apologize
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question obviously
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're not taking money for road closures
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
we're taking money for
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
paving of roads and
 
02:13:38.159 --> 02:13:39.669 align:start position:0%
paving of roads and
um

02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
we have i mean in my town we have worn
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
articles often or um
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
even in the budget for road paving and
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
that the the reason that you have roads
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
is so that people can travel not so that
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
they can be closed off
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
like obviously if it's for safety or
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance those those are already um
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
allowed in this bill this is closure
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
um by a request of some person
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know or group saying i want
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know main street closed for
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
for me so that i can you know
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
have a cat parade or something like that
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
right and if they if the town is okay
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
with that that's fine but i think the
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
town should have a say in whether or not
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
they're closing off main street you know
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
one follow-up yes just a quick follow-up
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
i guess um
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
i go back to represent representative
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
fans question is that
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
so if they closed it for
 
02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:39.669 align:start position:0%
so if they closed it for
one

02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
day for a cat parade i know they
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't but if they did for a
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
cat parade
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the money that was
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
used to pave that road
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
is being used incorrectly even though on
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
the 364 days
 
02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
people are traveling on that
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
is that with you right the townspeople
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
should have
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
the the ability to use the roads that
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
they paid for right if they're not
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
if they're being hindered from that
 
02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
if they're being hindered from that
that's

02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
without you know a say in the process
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
that is a problem i see
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:15:16.719 --> 02:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
representative

02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:25.109 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
going back to the what is the problem
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to be solved in the existing
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
statute it limits
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
the term of the license already
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
to a very short time
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
is it really that much of a problem
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
to close a road
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
last night at our city council meeting
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
in lebanon we actually had this
 
02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:51.750 align:start position:0%
in lebanon we actually had this
discussion

02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
about closing off a street for a period
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
of some years
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
so that a restaurant could have outdoor
 
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
seating during the summer
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the vote was yes because the city
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
needs the revenue that the restaurant
 
02:16:05.119 --> 02:16:06.390 align:start position:0%
needs the revenue that the restaurant
produces

02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
produces
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
so you may be closing off one avenue so
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.069 align:start position:0%
to speak
and

02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
closing off more inadvertently
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
by doing this
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
do you think that that could be an
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
unintended outcome
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
um it sounds
 
02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
um it sounds
like

02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
like your town is
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
is giving
 
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.470 align:start position:0%
is giving
um

02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
or or city is giving uh
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
the people
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
some say and whether the roads are
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
closing so i think that's actually
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
unusual um but
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that's that that would
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
be limited by this because you would
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
still be able to
 
02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:50.790 align:start position:0%
still be able to
to

02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
do that representative uh do you
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
care to take any more questions i i
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
really have to go so
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
i'm already five minutes late i'm not
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
sure if they
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
are running on time so
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:14.309 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.319 --> 02:17:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
and now i'd like to call catherine heck
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine heck from the new
 
02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association and we
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
are here to oppose this bill
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
we did have some concerns over the
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
legislative finding as it relates to
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
the budget and fraudulent expenditures
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
of money
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law allows the
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
governing body to expend up to the
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
amount in the approved bottom line of
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
the budget so due to changes in
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances or conditions and the
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
inexact nature of budgeting rsa 3210
 
02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
corrects that by requiring the governing
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
body to do a line item transfer which is
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
transparent so if any funds were somehow
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
being diverted
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
which i'm not really sure based on the
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
testimony now that we have a clearer
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
it still would be transparent that some
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
purpose might have changed through the
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
line item transfer requirement that the
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
law provides
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
additionally the local governing body
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
under statute has the ability to
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
determine policy and decisions regarding
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
the local roads so the requirements of
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
this bill seem to deviate the governing
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
body's authority as a local select board
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
and they would be then unable to make
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
any decisions about a request until the
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
town meeting the annual town meeting and
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
any new requests that came in would have
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
to wait an entire year for the next town
 
02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:54.070 align:start position:0%
to wait an entire year for the next town
meeting

02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill removes local authority
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's already granted to the governing
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
body to make such decisions
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
and it is our understanding that
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
the governing body would have a
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
permitting process whether it be through
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
the select board or perhaps a town
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
manager that would set forth clear
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines and that would be
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
open and available to the public to
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
weigh in on so thank you
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh thank you

02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
allegation is here
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
let's use round numbers i pay a hundred
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%

02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%

of maintaining the roads
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
and if you keep me from driving on this
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
road then you have stolen one 365th
 
02:19:45.439 --> 02:19:46.629 align:start position:0%
road then you have stolen one 365th
of

02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%

presume the sponsor's intent but it
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%

02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
what he was indicating
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%

147 colon 1
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
deals with the health officer authority
 
02:32:41.429 --> 02:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
specifically the authority to create
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%

02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
the issue is that this statute is overly

the issue is that this statute is overly
broad

02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
broad
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's vague
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it does not match what is already
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
the existing guidance
 
02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:57.680 align:start position:0%

in any way the current duties
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
and authorities of the health officer in

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
briefly what does a health officer do
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
firstly a health office has
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
three hours of required training as far
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
as i know to to become a health officer
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
in a town
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
i have included
 
02:33:59.110 --> 02:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
the role of the health officer which you
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
should see in your packet of information
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
which is taken from the dhhs website
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
of that manual which is communicable or
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
but in sure the health officer does do a
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
lot of things i'm i'm somewhat familiar
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%

02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
certain portion of the health officer
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
regulation was written that it was
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
written as as follows and if you indulge
 
02:35:04.319 --> 02:35:05.190 align:start position:0%
written as as follows and if you indulge
me

02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
just a certain portion of the health
 
02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
just a certain portion of the health
officer

02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.590 align:start position:0%
officer
statute

02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
the health officers of towns may make
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
regulations for the prevention and
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
removal of nuisances
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
and such other regulations relating to
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
the public health as in their judgment
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of the people
 
02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of the people
require

02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
a little open-ended um
 
02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:32.389 align:start position:0%
a little open-ended um
so

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
and then it just you know describes how
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's done
 
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
which i'll take effect when approved by
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
the selectmen recorded by the town clerk
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
and published in some newspaper printed
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the town or when copies have been
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
posted in two or more public places in
 
02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:47.590 align:start position:0%
posted in two or more public places in
town

02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement for a public
 
02:35:49.359 --> 02:35:51.429 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement for a public
hearing

02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:35:51.439 --> 02:35:52.469 align:start position:0%
hearing
usually

02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
usually
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
as far as i know when you make
 
02:35:56.710 --> 02:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
ordinances in regulation in town
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
the legislative body of the town gets to
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
have a say in that
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i assume they mean emergency
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh this is pertaining to emergencies
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
so in my research
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
i have found that the state of vermont
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
has a
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
quite a bit a more robust
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
language here that provides
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
for some grievance um
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
for somebody who may have had an
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
ordinance passed say against their
 
02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:30.630 align:start position:0%
ordinance passed say against their
property

02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:31.830 align:start position:0%
property
specifically

02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:33.990 align:start position:0%
specifically
or

02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
or for the public to to to have some
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
sort of check
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
so there's no check here is the problem
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
um let me see my notes here
 
02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:47.830 align:start position:0%
um let me see my notes here
okay

02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
so i have um
 
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
i've got the amendment here
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and i understand that uh the nhma is
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
not happy with some of this
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
but i am willing to change it so what i
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
did was take if you look at your
 
02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:06.389 align:start position:0%
did was take if you look at your
amendment

02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
um sections b and c
 
02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
are verbatim from the vermont
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
it kind of limits it and clarifies
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
what it is that they
 
02:37:23.110 --> 02:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
that the health officer
 
02:37:24.309 --> 02:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
may do
 
02:37:24.319 --> 02:37:25.190 align:start position:0%
may do
it's

02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
pertains to emergency health orders
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
which is why i what i
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
assume that they meant by
 
02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
147 here
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
in section c
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
it says a person to whom an emergency
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
health order is directed shall be given
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for a hearing within
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
five business days of the issuance of
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
such an order
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
a person who is in full compliance with
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
the emergency health order may request
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
and shall be granted an extension of
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
this hearing date if the emergency order
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
was issued by the commissioner of health
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
and human services uh
 
02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:03.429 align:start position:0%
and human services uh
services

02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:38:06.309 --> 02:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
under rsa 147 colon two such a hearing
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
shall be in front of the commissioner
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh et cetera et cetera so um there is a
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for rebuttal
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
because in theory
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
an ordinance could be passed
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
that is directed at someone's property
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
some recourse should be given
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
the next thing that i've done is in this
 
02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:29.750 align:start position:0%
the next thing that i've done is in this
amendment

02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
is take language that is directly
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
from the role of the health officer
 
02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:37.349 align:start position:0%
from the role of the health officer
guidance

02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
from the health officer manual that is
 
02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.270 align:start position:0%
from the health officer manual that is
online

02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it specifies what sort of things so
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see under
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
number six
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
what sort of
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
things the health officer may
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
pass ordinance about or regulation about
 
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
garbage insects unsanitary living
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
conditions rodents and safe drinking
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
water inspections
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
taken directly
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.479 --> 02:39:09.429 align:start position:0%

but not solving communicable disease
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
problems for the town
 
02:40:20.399 --> 02:40:21.110 align:start position:0%
problems for the town
i

02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
they don't have the training for that
 
02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
they don't have the training for that
but

02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
working with the commissioner
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
is perfectly
 
02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate in this case
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%

hampshire constitution means oh thank

representatives davis for pointing that
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
out to me um
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a bit nervous my first bill
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
um this
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative davis is referring to
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
the section uh starting at number nine
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:10.630 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
um

02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
provided however that no by-law or
 
02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
ordinance made by a local health officer
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
shall be repugnant to the constitution
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
or laws of the state
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative why i put that in there
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
is because it's already in
 
02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:25.510 align:start position:0%
is because it's already in
our

02:41:25.510 --> 02:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
sister ordinance to this one for cities
 
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
and for cities
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
so you'll see later when i visit you
 
02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:33.590 align:start position:0%
so you'll see later when i visit you
again

02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
again
um

02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:35.349 align:start position:0%
um
that

02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
when we deal with the same ordinance uh
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
same statute i'm sorry for cities
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
that clause is in their verbatim
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to keep it consistent
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
and that is why i put that in there
 
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
but i am happy to take it out if if it
 
02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
makes no sense
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
to people but um as i was
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
speaking with others i am
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
open to
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
amending this
 
02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:06.950 align:start position:0%
amending this
and

02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i stated but
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
i put in here starting at number 11.
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
such bylaws and ordinances shall take
 
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
effect and be enforced from the time
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
adopted for not longer than 10 days
 
02:42:20.309 --> 02:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
without the sanction or confirmation of
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
any other authority
 
02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
and then i go and talk about clear and
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
present danger which is a legal term
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
but apparently that doesn't um nh nhma
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
will point out that that applies to
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
i am happy to take those two things out
 
02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:39.510 align:start position:0%
i am happy to take those two things out
the

02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
10 days
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
and the clear and present danger because
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
what i did was define more carefully and
 
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:47.269 align:start position:0%
what i did was define more carefully and
narrowly

02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
narrowly
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
at the top
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
under line six
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
what it is exactly a health officer
 
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
should be making ordinance about
 
02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:56.469 align:start position:0%
should be making ordinance about
it's

02:42:56.469 --> 02:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
limited to those
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
such things garbage insects etc
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
which is taken right from their manual
 
02:43:05.990 --> 02:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
as far as what they do and then if
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
things need to be added later
 
02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
than that they can be
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
he said i i will take that out if the
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative ian
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative um i'm looking at this
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
list of things that health officers of
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
towns may make emergency regulations for
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
miss thing missing which is communicable
 
02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:44.790 align:start position:0%
miss thing missing which is communicable
disease

02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
disease
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
is that intentional
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative are you i'm
 
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
looking looking line six oh line six
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay where it says that health officers
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
of towns may make emergency regulations
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
for the prevention and removal of
 
02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:01.590 align:start position:0%
for the prevention and removal of
nuisances

02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
nuisances
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
such as garbage insects on sanitary
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
living conditions rodents and safe
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
drinking water inspections
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
but it looks to me like the communicable
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
diseases is part of this
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
in the handbook so is the elimination of
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases
 
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
um intentional here
 
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative van um
 
02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:26.469 align:start position:0%
representative van um
i

02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
only intentional in that
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
it conflicts already with the health
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
officer manual
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
which does not state anywhere
 
02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:37.510 align:start position:0%
which does not state anywhere
that

02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
a health officer may make regulations
 
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
for a town
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
about communicable diseases but has a
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
supportive role
 
02:44:49.349 --> 02:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner as you would expect
 
02:44:51.269 --> 02:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
a small town
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
to um have a city may be different now
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
the cities have a whole separate
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
different um
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
a set of they have board of they have
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
boards of health and
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's a more robust system but
 
02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
from what i see
 
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
small towns towns now aren't set up for
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
the management of regular regulating
 
02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:15.190 align:start position:0%
the management of regular regulating
townspeople

02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
townspeople
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
in addition not just regulating but
 
02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
or any kind of check or balance
 
02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
or any kind of check or balance
whatsoever

02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
and so there's a possibility to
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
to put in here communicable diseases in
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
some way but tell you tell me what way
 
02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
that would be because
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's not exactly clear how how far they
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you oh i hope that answers your
 
02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:47.190 align:start position:0%
thank you oh i hope that answers your
question

02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
you do okay
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mistake sorry about that
 
02:45:58.389 --> 02:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you so much uh both of
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
you and and thank you representative for
 
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in the um
 
02:46:05.349 --> 02:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
information that we got from the
 
02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
comments and and i'm gonna preface this
 
02:46:10.479 --> 02:46:12.950 align:start position:0%
comments and and i'm gonna preface this
with

02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i will ask a follow-up question do
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
you not feel that being this specific of
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
naming these um items
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
that there could be unintended
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
consequences of something that we forget
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
such as what was put in the letter
 
02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
that i don't you probably have not seen
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
it but it says failure of septic tank is
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
another common nuisance
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
that may spread from one property to
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
another creating a health hazard that
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
can affect water and air quality
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
so by being so
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
specific of listing what the
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote nuisances are
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we could forget something and
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
in the end have an unintended
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
consequences by this
 
02:46:54.389 --> 02:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative um
 
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
the the issue is that you can have an
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
unattended consequence for from having
 
02:46:59.439 --> 02:47:00.550 align:start position:0%
unattended consequence for from having
a

02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
giving the health officer godlike powers
 
02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
to pass any regulation whatsoever and if
 
02:47:08.469 --> 02:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
you read it carefully
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
in any
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
such any other regulations relating to
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
public health as their judgment the
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
people require
 
02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's extremely broad but
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
to your point though
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
septic issues are something that health
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
officers deal with all the time and it's
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
already in their purview
 
02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:28.150 align:start position:0%
already in their purview
to

02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
deal with those issues
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis this ordinance
 
02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
this section
 
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
of amending this part
 
02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
only deals with them passing an
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
ordinance which would affect the entire
 
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:43.030 align:start position:0%
ordinance which would affect the entire
town

02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't
 
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
prevent them from dealing with septic
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
issues which they do every single day
 
02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
and it's it's already in the statutes
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
elsewhere how they deal with that it's a
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
that that they would be enforcing go
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
ahead when you follow up yes
 
02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to make it quick um i i
 
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
guess if if it's in the statute um i
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
understand what you're what you're
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
saying but i have a concern that we have
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
this letter that that basically says
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
that this is omitted and that
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is part of what they define as a
 
02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:17.269 align:start position:0%
this is part of what they define as a
nuisance

02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
nuisance
 
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
um so i guess mike my question is
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
should it not also be listed under under
 
02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
your nuisances
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then again
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
because they brought this up the
 
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
limiting what they could possibly do if
 
02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
something like this came up well i
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i believe unsanitary
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
living conditions would
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
be that would cover septic
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:47.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
thanks

02:48:47.910 --> 02:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:48:51.269 --> 02:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions majority
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i don't i don't know
 
02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
that i've properly formed this question
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm having a hard time
 
02:48:58.469 --> 02:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
reconciling the word emergency with all
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
of the other definitions
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
all the other instances that we have
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
drafted here or that you have come up
 
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
with here
 
02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
with here
so

02:49:09.910 --> 02:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
by who is defining what agency what what
 
02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
what anybody who is defining the word
 
02:49:16.479 --> 02:49:18.870 align:start position:0%
what anybody who is defining the word
emergency

02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
and how is it reconciled against garbage
 
02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
for instance and insect for instance i i
 
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
think of a bill that we just heard this
 
02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
morning about composting and if for some
 
02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
morning about composting and if for some
reason

02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
if that bill were to pass and we would
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
have pests
 
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
would that be an emergency situation i i
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
just don't i'm trying to figure out how
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
they will define if that's an emergency
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
sorry that it's not a mature question
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's i haven't formulated it in my
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
head yet
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:48.399 --> 02:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
i guess it doesn't matter if that word
 
02:49:56.230 --> 02:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
emergency is in there or not um
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
but i i was taking it i guess i what i
 
02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
did was i took it from vermont's
 
02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:02.710 align:start position:0%
did was i took it from vermont's
regulations

02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
so that people could understand why
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the usual route for passing a
 
02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
town ordinance
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
would be superseded by this
 
02:50:18.479 --> 02:50:20.830 align:start position:0%
would be superseded by this
shortcut

02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
shortcut
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's it it does make makes no difference
 
02:50:25.750 --> 02:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's in there or not because
 
02:50:29.030 --> 02:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a way it's a
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's a method for
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh regulation to be passed whether it's
 
02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:34.309 align:start position:0%
uh regulation to be passed whether it's
um

02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
you call it an emergency some people may
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
call an emergency others may say
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
where's the emergency
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
if that is what's hanging us up is is
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
the word emergency not being defined i
 
02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
would happily take it out
 
02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:54.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:58.550 align:start position:0%
representative
yes

02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
02:51:01.359 --> 02:51:02.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
um

02:51:02.230 --> 02:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:07.030 --> 02:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
would this bill have any implications
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
considering our current status
 
02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
considering our current status
of

02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
previously we had a health emergency
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
declared by the governor
 
02:51:20.950 --> 02:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire because of
 
02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:22.870 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire because of
covet

02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
covet
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
could a
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
person who is a health officer
 
02:51:27.439 --> 02:51:30.830 align:start position:0%
person who is a health officer
for

02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.150 --> 02:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
instance declare
 
02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
unilaterally declare
 
02:51:38.309 --> 02:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
some sort of health emergency
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
and for instance
 
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
require everyone to wear masks
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day that sort of thing
 
02:51:52.150 --> 02:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
would this have those implications
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um i i believe
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is
 
02:51:58.790 --> 02:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
in amendment is trying seeking to
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
prevent um
 
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things but not i don't see
 
02:52:07.510 --> 02:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
and as a on a personal note i don't have
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
any issue with the
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
the mask mandates that are in place now
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
really not about that but about perhaps
 
02:52:19.349 --> 02:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
curfews or
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to list all the things but
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
 
02:52:25.269 --> 02:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
state of massachusetts website you'll
 
02:52:28.230 --> 02:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
have different types of mask ordinances
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
in different towns and cities
 
02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
that change from day to day we have
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
two or three towns already that have
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
mask ordinances that had them that
 
02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
cancel them that are bringing them back
 
02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:42.469 align:start position:0%
cancel them that are bringing them back
um

02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
i've gone to the website and i can't
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
even find them the mask ordinance on the
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
town of hanover's website so i wouldn't
 
02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:50.070 align:start position:0%
town of hanover's website so i wouldn't
know

02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
if i was visiting
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
whether i needed to wear a mask it's not
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
even on there so that is why we're not a
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
home rule state
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen we're
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
trying seeking to avoid uh piecemeal
 
02:53:06.230 --> 02:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
regulation town to town
 
02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
we've carved out
 
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
an exception for cities which have a
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
board of health and they have a separate
 
02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
rsa that deals with just this which we
 
02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
can address later that they they have
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
more broad powers to regulate their own
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
city they have a board of health etc but
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
as far as all the smaller towns
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
it isn't it somewhat of a nightmare to
 
02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
it isn't it somewhat of a nightmare to
have

02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:53:31.110 --> 02:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
different ordinances all across the town
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
when we have a governor who can declare
 
02:53:35.990 --> 02:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency in a mass mandate
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
02:53:39.429 --> 02:53:39.439 align:start position:0%
and that is just one example i certainly
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
limit this discussion to just mass
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
because it is certainly not about that
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
but about
 
02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:48.309 align:start position:0%
but about
something

02:53:48.309 --> 02:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
that we should think about for the next
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
hundred years as far as
 
02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
what sort of things we want them to
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
address and i would suggest that the
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
health officer would be grateful not to
 
02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
have to be responsible for communicable
 
02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
have to be responsible for communicable
diseases

02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
in their community
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
given their limited
 
02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:08.309 align:start position:0%
given their limited
training

02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers that
 
02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:12.230 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers that
representative

02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um mr chairman and um
 
02:54:18.550 --> 02:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
you you said something that kind of
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
piqued me when you said we have a
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
governor that
 
02:54:25.269 --> 02:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
would would make these
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
decisions etc um
 
02:54:30.389 --> 02:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps i i'm wrong but i i live in the
 
02:54:32.309 --> 02:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
city of nashville we do have a
 
02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
mask mandate
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
and if i'm not mistaken the governor
 
02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
turned it over to the municipalities to
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
determine what was best for there
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
would this not kind of take that away he
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
you would be putting it
 
02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
are you directing it to be put on the
 
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
shoulder of the governor to have to
 
02:54:56.309 --> 02:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
decide what is best for the entire state
 
02:54:58.710 --> 02:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
when he very clearly made a comment
 
02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
what's good for the north is not
 
02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily good for the south or the
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
east and the west
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
he would have to make a decision for the
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
entire or she would have to make a
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
decision for the entire state
 
02:55:11.910 --> 02:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that kind of put a little bit
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
more burden
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
when he knows or she knows in fact that
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
each area is very different
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative and that's exactly right
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
i believe the governor pointed to this
 
02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:29.750 align:start position:0%
i believe the governor pointed to this
ordinance

02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:33.190 --> 02:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
was he passing the buck i don't know but
 
02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:35.750 align:start position:0%
was he passing the buck i don't know but
um

02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
that is perfectly fine if we had boards
 
02:55:41.349 --> 02:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
of health in each town
 
02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
um that the problem again is that
 
02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
there's no limit
 
02:55:47.269 --> 02:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
to what sort of
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
things what what how far they can take
 
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
any mandate now i'm not talking about uh
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
just mass mandate but any
 
02:55:59.190 --> 02:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
any health health mandate curfews or
 
02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates um where's the limit
 
02:56:05.110 --> 02:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
here in the in this language
 
02:56:09.910 --> 02:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
to what they can do it's so open-ended
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's in their judgment
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's a person with three hours of
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
training that's a lay person and they
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
work with the board of selectmen
 
02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
none of them have any medical training
 
02:56:26.479 --> 02:56:28.150 align:start position:0%
none of them have any medical training
so

02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you allow the
 
02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
people living in the town at least a
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative stavis
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
in how many communities in new hampshire
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
are there health officers with
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
relatively little to no medical training
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:57:00.469 --> 02:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
i don't i just know the ones that i have
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
know of um
 
02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
know of um
offhand

02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
offhand
 
02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:05.590 align:start position:0%
offhand
anecdotally

02:57:05.590 --> 02:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my follow-up
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
then can you tell me upon what basis you
 
02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
make the statement that town health
 
02:57:13.439 --> 02:57:15.110 align:start position:0%
make the statement that town health
officers

02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
have limited training or none at all
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you i
 
02:57:24.230 --> 02:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
would like to clarify that i did not say
 
02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
no training at all
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
but they have three hours of training
 
02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
you know to to to address what's in this
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
this manual
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
and what's in this manual
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
clearly states
 
02:57:44.230 --> 02:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
that what the commissioner and dhhs
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
would like them to do is support
 
02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
um the health officer liaison liaison
 
02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:51.510 align:start position:0%
um the health officer liaison liaison
unit

02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's all over here
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
spelled out i don't know how much more
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
clearly it has to be but
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
um it's all about assisting
 
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
that why i don't know why we wouldn't
 
02:58:05.349 --> 02:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
have we have an epidemiologist
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
state department
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
and they have experts and they're well
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
aware they have medical doctors that can
 
02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
tell us if we need
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
what what we need and i would like to
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
defer to them
 
02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
02:58:26.550 --> 02:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
um in addition to
 
02:58:32.230 --> 02:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns raised by my
 
02:58:34.230 --> 02:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues regarding the
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
application of what's or the definition
 
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
of repugnant or
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
emergency i also have a question about
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
on line nine it says
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
without the sanction or confirmation of
 
02:58:49.750 --> 02:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
any other authority
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
is that local authority
 
02:58:53.910 --> 02:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
elected authority appointed authority
 
02:58:57.110 --> 02:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
state authority national authority it
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
seems as though that would really allow
 
02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
the health officer to
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know are they defining who their
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
authority is
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
oh thank you uh representative wrong
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
i have highlighted in yellow i hope your
 
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
copy also has it highlighted in yellow
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
i meant to remove that and i'm terribly
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
but i sent it off and i did not remove
 
02:59:22.389 --> 02:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
but it is my intention to remove this
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
because it is vague and
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
um i basically put it in originally as a
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:37.349 --> 02:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
when i first wrote the bill but i am i
 
02:59:37.359 --> 02:59:38.630 align:start position:0%
when i first wrote the bill but i am i
am

02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
i i aim to take that out
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and i as i stated before i can also
 
02:59:46.309 --> 02:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
take about
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
take out
 
02:59:50.630 --> 02:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
the repugnant um to the constitution we
 
02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
could take that out but i i just really
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
the only reason why i put that in there
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
is to be consistent with the the other
 
03:00:00.230 --> 03:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
to me it's it's irregardless but i the
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
stuff in yellow that i highlighted i
 
03:00:07.110 --> 03:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
will take out
 
03:00:08.469 --> 03:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
03:00:08.479 --> 03:00:12.630 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
representative

03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think so thank you mr chair and thank
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
you again for taking uh another question
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
you've i i understand part a of parent a
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh about controlling the ability for
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
creating that ordinance i get that
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
and i understand b and c parents b and
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
parent c about issuing the order and
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
then having recourse
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to reconcile and hoping
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
03:00:40.150 --> 03:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
easy answer that i'm missing is why are
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
they all together
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
could aren't those kind of separate
 
03:00:45.670 --> 03:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
things because the order
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
in order for an emergent problem may be
 
03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
isolated but the top portion of this
 
03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be more focused on what may be
 
03:01:00.469 --> 03:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
a a more general emergency does that
 
03:01:02.070 --> 03:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
make any sense could could these be
 
03:01:05.269 --> 03:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
parsed into two separate issues or two
 
03:01:08.070 --> 03:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
separate amendments
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
i don't see a problem with that
 
03:01:11.910 --> 03:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you
 
03:01:13.830 --> 03:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay um are there any other questions
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
was there other people that do have to
 
03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
testify and i think that uh
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
this representative has been through
 
03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
quite a bit here so
 
03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're all set
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to call um
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
nat grace
 
03:01:32.230 --> 03:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
 
03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:41.110 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
authority

03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grays from the
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill as a as originally
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
written um and
 
03:01:52.870 --> 03:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment i haven't had time to
 
03:01:54.710 --> 03:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
look at but my
 
03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
belief is i would at least as written
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're opposing it
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding from the sponsor's
 
03:02:03.030 --> 03:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today is that she intends to
 
03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
testimony today is that she intends to
remove

03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
remove
 
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
essentially the
 
03:02:10.630 --> 03:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
bolded italic portion beginning in line
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
nine with provided through
 
03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:14.469 align:start position:0%
nine with provided through
uh

03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
line 14 ending with clear and present
 
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
danger if you've read my written
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that was much of what we
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
objected to as that was
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
basically the original bill
 
03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
basically the original bill
um

03:02:25.830 --> 03:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:28.550 --> 03:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
so i do want to address a couple other
 
03:02:31.110 --> 03:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
issues that have come up today
 
03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:32.070 align:start position:0%
issues that have come up today
i

03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
agree that the phrase emergency doesn't
 
03:02:38.790 --> 03:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
make much sense in this statute
 
03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
as this committee will probably recall
 
03:02:44.070 --> 03:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
last year we had house bill 79 which was
 
03:02:46.550 --> 03:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
a fairly extensive rewrite of the health
 
03:02:48.309 --> 03:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
officer statutes
 
03:02:50.309 --> 03:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
in part and imposed that three-hour
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
training requirement
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
and it was really done in response to
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
some long-term issues that had been
 
03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
identified both in the health officer
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
side and on dhhs's side
 
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
in order to make those two
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
basic units of government function
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
better together
 
03:03:08.230 --> 03:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
and really the local health officer's
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
authority to issue any regulations
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
relating to the public health as in
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
their judgment
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
the health and safety that people
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
require is designed to address local
 
03:03:18.319 --> 03:03:19.750 align:start position:0%
require is designed to address local
issues

03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:03:21.429 --> 03:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
so statewide issues are obviously
 
03:03:23.429 --> 03:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
addressed by the legislature and by
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority at dhhs but local
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
issues such as bed bug infestations
 
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
or you know bears getting into garbage
 
03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
cans etc they don't require a state
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
response they require local response
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore this is a broad statute
 
03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
and it gives local authorities some
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
gives local authorities the authority to
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
deal with those local issues
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
as far as the uh limiting of the scope
 
03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
of that authority is i think it's
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
possible that we could be overlooking
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
some issues and i'm i'm
 
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
believe dhhs's letter pointed that out
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
that's a certainly a concern
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
because i don't know all possible issues
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
that might come up that a local health
 
03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
officer would have to deal with
 
03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:13.750 align:start position:0%
officer would have to deal with
um

03:04:13.750 --> 03:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
realistically it's going to be whatever
 
03:04:17.590 --> 03:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
comes up in their community
 
03:04:19.590 --> 03:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
because more often than not how they
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
receive information is someone in their
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
community has a problem whether that's
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
rats coming from their neighbor's house
 
03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
or whether that's they went to a hotel
 
03:04:29.670 --> 03:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
in their bed bugs or
 
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be you know the
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
septic system is overflowing
 
03:04:36.389 --> 03:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
and they report that to a town official
 
03:04:38.230 --> 03:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
the town official contacts the local
 
03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
health officer
 
03:04:41.349 --> 03:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
and in many cases
 
03:04:43.349 --> 03:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
um you know that the health officer
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a full-time position
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
they have degrees in public health um so
 
03:04:50.070 --> 03:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're very well credentialed
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
individuals serving as public health
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
officers in many municipalities
 
03:04:55.510 --> 03:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
i've talked to a number of them over the
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
past couple of days
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they've studied many of them
 
03:05:04.230 --> 03:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
have advanced degrees in that
 
03:05:06.070 --> 03:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
and really the purpose of that
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
three-hour training from last year's
 
03:05:14.070 --> 03:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
hb 79 was in order to provide a
 
03:05:16.870 --> 03:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
best practices type of information to
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
health officers because they might have
 
03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh that public health training if
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're a larger municipality or if
 
03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
they're a smaller municipality like a
 
03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
municipality of 2000 people you know
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have a full-time
 
03:05:30.309 --> 03:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
health officer they probably don't have
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
to deal with a lot of those issues very
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
frequently it's probably going to be a
 
03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
select board member or someone else
 
03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
who's already serving often a long-term
 
03:05:38.240 --> 03:05:39.269 align:start position:0%
who's already serving often a long-term
serving

03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
serving
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
member of the municipal government
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
who has to do this on a case-by-case
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
basis so you know though they receive a
 
03:05:47.910 --> 03:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
report that you know somebody's a
 
03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
hoarder or something like that and the
 
03:05:51.030 --> 03:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
health officers called in to help deal
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
with that help navigate them through the
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
mental health uh
 
03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
service process
 
03:05:56.560 --> 03:05:57.670 align:start position:0%
service process
um

03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
and to deal with kind of the aftermath
 
03:06:01.990 --> 03:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
of what happens there
 
03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:03.030 align:start position:0%
of what happens there
and

03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:03.830 align:start position:0%
and
so

03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
while those individuals may not have
 
03:06:07.269 --> 03:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
advanced degrees
 
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to be looking at these
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
common everyday things which are covered
 
03:06:12.710 --> 03:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
in the health officers guide and that's
 
03:06:15.269 --> 03:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
really the purpose of that guidebook
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
in order to help them with those common
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
issues and of course since we have
 
03:06:22.230 --> 03:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
revised the statutes they now have a
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
better and more
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
robust ability to contact dhhs
 
03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
experts there as well as health officers
 
03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
and other municipalities
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
to ask for best practices and advice
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's necessary to
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
change that authority
 
03:06:42.150 --> 03:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
as far as representative majorie's
 
03:06:44.070 --> 03:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
question about
 
03:06:46.630 --> 03:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
subsections b and c
 
03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
it appears
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
it appears like one of the focuses of
 
03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:06:55.510 --> 03:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
some sort of emergency health order that
 
03:06:59.110 --> 03:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
might be issued through a state like a
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
quarantine order or something like that
 
03:07:02.790 --> 03:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's not something a local health
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
officer would do
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
they might be directed by dhhs to assist
 
03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
in some capacity and there are other
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
statutes related to that
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
but that's not something they would do
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
on their own it's not something that
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to be addressed in
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.990 --> 03:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from mr grace
 
03:07:27.510 --> 03:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
i see none thank you very much for your
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%

good morning chairman dolan and members
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%

03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i represent
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
dhhs division of public health services
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
as a brief background i have a few
 
03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
decades of experience in public health
 
03:07:53.349 --> 03:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
inspections and training i now supervise
 
03:07:55.750 --> 03:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
a small program that provides technical
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
assistance to one part-time person
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
who provides support for over 300 health
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
officers across the state the program
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
responds to hundreds of inquiries a year
 
03:08:05.830 --> 03:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
to assess and solve local health
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
problems with the help of the local
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
health officer in short we work to
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that health office are ready to
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
address sanitary conditions in
 
03:08:14.550 --> 03:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
homeschools day care facilities and
 
03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
other locations um committee members
 
03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the testimony and i'll
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
just try to summarize some brief points
 
03:08:22.710 --> 03:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
from that now
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
there is a new amendment on the table
 
03:08:25.990 --> 03:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
i've just started to kind of review that
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
and better understand it it needs some
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
further review we came here to provide
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
information dhhs yet need to oppose it
 
03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
based on the this amendment um that's
 
03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
been presented
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
um we're concerned about a couple
 
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill and let me copy
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
those now
 
03:08:42.790 --> 03:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
um in regards to news health nuisances
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
currently local officers are provided
 
03:08:47.590 --> 03:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
authority under rsa 147 and it's broad
 
03:08:49.030 --> 03:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
authority where they may make
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
regulations um so what is a public
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
health nuisance um often it's a waste
 
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
product it's a pest it's a noxious agent
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
that can move from one property to
 
03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
another that's what makes it a public
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
health problem within your home that's
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
more of a private issue a private health
 
03:09:02.399 --> 03:09:03.510 align:start position:0%
more of a private issue a private health
issue

03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:09:04.710 --> 03:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
common examples that people have
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned include rubbish and biological
 
03:09:08.469 --> 03:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
waste from people and animals septic
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
failures pest and bed bug infestations
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
the role the health officer is important
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
to dhhs they're part of the local
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
community they know their neighbors and
 
03:09:19.510 --> 03:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
they can make informed decisions about
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
when and how to respond to health
 
03:09:22.870 --> 03:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
hazards that are out there
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
i think the existing law works very well
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
even as being as broad as it is it
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of flexibility to health
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
officers and the department receives
 
03:09:31.830 --> 03:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
very few complaints about local health
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
officers or the codes that are there
 
03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
under this law there's an existing
 
03:09:38.229 --> 03:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
process to ensure the codes are
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and addressed and address
 
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
local concerns
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
the law states that all local codes must
 
03:09:45.349 --> 03:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
be approved by the selectmen and there
 
03:09:47.110 --> 03:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
are recorded and announced via public
 
03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:48.309 align:start position:0%
are recorded and announced via public
notices

03:09:48.309 --> 03:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
notices
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
we do need to avoid confusion the
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
department believes that local
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances are already reviewed by
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
municipal attorneys and have the best
 
03:09:56.790 --> 03:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
qualifications and i realize now
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the representative mentioned she
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
was planning to remove
 
03:10:01.349 --> 03:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
the issues around
 
03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and also remove the
 
03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
runs about limiting 10 days unless
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's confirmation by another
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
authority so that may have been resolved
 
03:10:10.790 --> 03:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
but the proposed language does not
 
03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:11.750 align:start position:0%
but the proposed language does not
provide

03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
a clear understanding of dangerous
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
situation versus injurious situation
 
03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
which is currently included in rsa 147
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
colon 3 relative to inspections and
 
03:10:20.479 --> 03:10:23.030 align:start position:0%
colon 3 relative to inspections and
complaints

03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
the burden on dhhs in order to implement
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
the bill the department will need to
 
03:10:28.630 --> 03:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
collaborate with many partners
 
03:10:30.630 --> 03:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
and the health officers association and
 
03:10:32.229 --> 03:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
the municipal association to determine
 
03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
how the changes may limit the current
 
03:10:35.670 --> 03:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
authority the department would also need
 
03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
to change our training curriculum to
 
03:10:38.950 --> 03:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
interpret how these changes might
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
affect implementation of rsa 147.
 
03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:43.110 align:start position:0%
affect implementation of rsa 147.
um

03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know as you know the committee
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
passed hb 79 last year this committee
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
did or didn't pass it but passed it out
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
of committee and was signed into law the
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
law improved training and support for
 
03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
health officers so we feel like day by
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
day year by year we're trying to improve
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
how they can do their job
 
03:10:59.910 --> 03:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
the issue is brought up around they
 
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't have medical training they don't
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
need medical training it's wonderful if
