00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
if we're all ready I think it's nine
 
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
o'clock so we can start our first
 
00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh interim study bill which is uh HB
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
1137 relative to the duty of school
 
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
boards to provide education
 
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
this was voted interim study I think by
 
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
a 12 to 6 margin
 
00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 align:start position:0%
um and uh just
 
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
for clarification of the members of this
 
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I had as cordelli Hobson
 
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
Moffett Mullen
 
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 align:start position:0%
Moffett Mullen
Tanner

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
Tanner
 
00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 align:start position:0%
and Hall
 
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
yeah right you just wouldn't be able to
 
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
vote on if we have votes you know right
 
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.130 align:start position:0%
vote on if we have votes you know right
um

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then the second one we have a 10 30
 
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.469 align:start position:0%
and then the second one we have a 10 30
is

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.270 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
1664 and I have as the members of that
 
00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee cordelli Hobson
 
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.609 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 align:start position:0%
um so the first order I guess is 11 37
 
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I was just gonna
 
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
throw it open first to any committee
 
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
members who had General comments
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
um about the bill and then we could go
 
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.570 align:start position:0%
um about the bill and then we could go
through

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of different
 
00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 align:start position:0%
sections and Provisions this we could go
 
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
through them
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
um one by one just to get a feel for uh
 
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
the committee's
 
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
feeling on whether any of these sections
 
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
should proceed
 
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.729 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative yeah you've got the um
 
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
and uh there's a sign in sheet and a
 
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
copy of the bill there as well if you
 
00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
yeah great does uh yeah representative
 
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you representative cordelli
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious uh with regards to
 
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
this bill I know that you're the prime
 
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
sponsor on the Bell so you are the app
 
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
to person to answer this
 
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.770 align:start position:0%
to person to answer this
um

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of changes to 189 one
 
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
made in this bill and I'm just wondering
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
if there was an opportunity for the
 
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
school boards Association or
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
the school administrators Association
 
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
did anybody collaborate with you on the
 
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
language of this bill
 
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
other General comments
 
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
I'm president of Lakers
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's one thing I'd love to see added on
 
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
here and that is that the res have it
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
actually in here in place that says the
 
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school board if
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
the town the people of the Town petition
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately to have a special meeting
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
that they must have it
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what a number of towns
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
including mine did and then after we did
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
the petition with all the right
 
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
signatures and everything and in spite
 
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
of the fact that the law says shall
 
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
they ignored it and voted to not hold
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
the meeting that we petitioned to have
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
held so and there were a number of quite
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
a few others in uh the state that did
 
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
the same thing and so put it here
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
so that it's all laid out for them so
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
they can't say well
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think that is a separate
 
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
statute and I think you're correct in
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
that it says shall
 
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
um but I I agree that a number of
 
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 align:start position:0%
districts did not
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
agree to adhere to the Shell I'm not
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
sure if it uh fits in here or it could
 
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
be strengthened the in the existing
 
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
statute but it's something to take a
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
look at for next year I I just figured
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
that since it was all yeah since we were
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
putting all these things all in one
 
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.030 align:start position:0%
putting all these things all in one
place

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
so that they can see them because they
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
made excuses about it not being their
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
Duty well if it's in here it's their
 
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.930 align:start position:0%
Duty well if it's in here it's their
Duty

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry I was late this morning
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
now fog
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of questions one is
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
to representative lakis if I could uh
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
what did the lawyer say was the reason
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
that they could circumvent the
 
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
the law they basically said oh well then
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
there's this other provision that we if
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
they don't do it we can take them to
 
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
court and so basically they were relying
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
on the fact that it costs money to take
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
them to court and that we wouldn't do it
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
so they were just flat out ignoring the
 
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.450 align:start position:0%
so they were just flat out ignoring the
law

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
assuming that nobody would take them to
 
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.890 align:start position:0%
assuming that nobody would take them to
court

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
so what would prevent them from doing
 
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
the same thing now and forcing you to go
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
to court on it
 
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.930 align:start position:0%
to court on it
well

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
nothing I had wanted another part as
 
00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
my second question is is actually more
 
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
of a request and that is when I went
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
through the the laws in the book that
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
are kind of scattered around
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
some of this duplicates what's already
 
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.409 align:start position:0%
some of this duplicates what's already
in

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
some of the new
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
verbiage actually duplicates what's in
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
here I was wondering if there was a
 
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
possibility to have a side by side of
 
00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
what is currently in law
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
um from maybe our our secretary of a
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
side by side of what's currently in law
 
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
and what is being proposed with this new
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
language because it seems like
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
some of it's conflicting some of it's
 
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
the same I mean I like I said I was
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
going through it
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
um the last couple days and and uh just
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't seem to be
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
coordinated and and if you want an
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
effort I think it should be coordinated
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
um we could see about that maybe we
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
first will have the discussion
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and see if
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee thinks any provision
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
should proceed with a recommendation of
 
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
legislation for next year
 
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and then take it from there
 
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.150 align:start position:0%
um and then take it from there
um

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh but uh since uh the school boards
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
Association was mentioned I was
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if they would like to come up

um and put it that way for about an hour
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
when this bill was heard last year so I
 
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
really don't have anything new to add to
 
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
that um I'm just here to sort of listen
 
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
to the conversation if there are
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
specific questions I'm happy to answer
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
those but I really don't have any
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
specific comment relative to the the
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%

general position was uh no position on
 
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
on the bill is that accurate correct uh
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes we did not take a
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
position on this bill last year when I

initially testified okay
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm sure there might be
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
questions as we proceed through the list
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
of uh recommendations and I'll be I'll
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
be here for the morning so thank you
 
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.570 align:start position:0%

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:01.610 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
shall we start down
 
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.180 align:start position:0%
the list of some of the uh
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the school board
 
00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:11.779 align:start position:0%
that were in the bill
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
if everyone has a copy
 
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.769 align:start position:0%
if everyone has a copy
um

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:19.220 align:start position:0%
it starts on my
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
copy as line 16 on the first page with
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
the school board shall be responsible
 
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.630 align:start position:0%
the school board shall be responsible
for

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
if if anyone is it maybe do you have
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
different line numbers I I do I have uh
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
section two starting on line nine okay
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'll get a copy of to match
 
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.170 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'll get a copy of to match
yours

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
so uh do you have any uh comments on
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
that section I do thank you for asking
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
um first of all I would like to know
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.310 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
um

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
in Roman 2 the sort of the introductory
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph the language has been changed
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
from establishing structure
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
accountability advocacy or whatever to
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
approving and overseeing and I'm
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
wondering why that language uh what the
 
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
deliberation was over the language
 
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:23.180 align:start position:0%
change and also in that same paragraph
 
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:28.019 align:start position:0%
content was added to the list and I'm
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
wondering as representative Tanner
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
referenced um
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
content uh
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
under the responsibilities of of
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
approving and overseeing as far as the
 
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
school board is concerned Why that was
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
added to that section
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.449 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
I thought that
 
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.590 align:start position:0%
I thought that
um well

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
um well
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
approving an overseeing versus
 
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:00.860 align:start position:0%
establishing first
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
establishing means to put in place
 
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:05.660 align:start position:0%
basically to establish
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
these things but I think that school
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
board responsibilities go beyond just
 
00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:14.779 align:start position:0%
establishing but they have to
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
manage and oversee as time progresses as
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
well so that I wanted to be at a future
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
look ahead that it's not just putting
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
something in place and then moving on
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
so that's why I added especially the
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
over scene
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
can I ask just a follow-up to that is
 
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
there any provision anywhere in the law
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
or in any of this legislation for
 
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.260 align:start position:0%
training school board members on
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
approving overseeing and whatnot of the
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
responsibilities listed
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
um I I think in the school boards
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
Association can correct me if wrong if
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but I believe we had testimony
 
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
from them several times last year about
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
the training that the School Board
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
Association offers to new board members
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm specifically referencing the
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
addition of content I'm just wondering
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
um what the standard will be for school
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
board members to
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh approve
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
and oversee content in areas that they
 
00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%
may not have expertise and I certainly
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
in charge of the chemistry content well
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
I think school boards should be
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
approving uh curriculum
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
um whether it be a chemistry or history
 
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
um whether it be a chemistry or history
um

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
so you know that's the reason for the
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
addition of content
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I bet you you're
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
glad I'm here
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
um could you explain to me then the
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
difference between content and
 
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.889 align:start position:0%
difference between content and
curriculum

00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:12:54.899 --> 00:13:00.790 align:start position:0%
curriculum
foreign

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
I think maybe content
 
00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:04.490 align:start position:0%
I think maybe content
um

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
goes beyond just curriculum but policies
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.030 align:start position:0%
and so forth
um

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
but uh you know I you know uh I
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
certainly uh see your point
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
um and it could be uh related to uh just
 
00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:23.329 align:start position:0%
um and it could be uh related to uh just
curriculum

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
just just as a follow-up on that
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
um so this the state is kind of
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
responsible for setting the standards
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
and the school board's responsible for
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
setting that curriculum and then the
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
teacher actually
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
um does the content work and that
 
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
content can be you know and is reviewed
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
on a on a basis uh with the with the um
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
building principle and and that sort of
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
thing but that's been my experience uh
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
as far as the structure of schools and
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
how things are kind of handled down uh
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
and as representative Mullen said you
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
know I'd I'd be hard-pressed even as a
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
trained educator and a person that's got
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of content in my head uh to
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
approve content for physics or chemistry
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
or or even
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
um the field of Health with the way
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
things are changing so rapidly so
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
um I would say that that uh I would take
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
the content out of that that particular
 
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.269 align:start position:0%
the content out of that that particular
line

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
um discussion on that
 
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.829 align:start position:0%
um discussion on that
area

00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
um see not happen if we go to uh uh
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility for curriculum
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.050 align:start position:0%

um

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:05.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
any feelings about uh
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
having those included as a board
 
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.949 align:start position:0%
having those included as a board
responsibility

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
can I just ask a clarifying question
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli sure so when
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
when you look at curriculum or textbooks
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
or educational materials or whatever and
 
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
we're looking at board approval
 
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.509 align:start position:0%
we're looking at board approval
um

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
is there a uniform process by which a
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
board would Grant approval
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
or is there an option for them to say to
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
the superintendent of schools or the
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction people or
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
whatever just make a recommendation and
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
then we will approve it I want our
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
school board members going to be
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
required to read these textbooks in
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
order to give approval
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
um my personal thinking is that uh
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
textbooks should be reviewed by board
 
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.689 align:start position:0%
textbooks should be reviewed by board
members

00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
um for uh approval
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
um a vote of the board to approve a new
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
textbook I remember an instance
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
um when I was on school board back in
 
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.090 align:start position:0%
um when I was on school board back in
Connecticut

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.100 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
and we had a new history Social Studies
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
textbook and
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
um in the chapter on the Cold War
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh did not mention
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
um President Reagan or the pope it was
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
all about Gorbachev which I thought was
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
a misstatement of history and I remember
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
in other instance looking at uh
 
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.749 align:start position:0%
in other instance looking at uh
curriculum

00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:46.259 align:start position:0%
for early
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh 20th century America
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
um history class and as a film to
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
illustrate what the early 20th century
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
was like in America they wanted to show
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
the movie The Godfather
 
00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:07.459 align:start position:0%
which I objected to and that was removed
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
but I think that uh
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
I I think that school board members
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
before the board approves in yeah I'm
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out how somebody
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
in a K-12 system
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
as a as a school board member is going
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
to have the
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
wherewithal or the availability of time
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
to read all of the text all of the new
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
textbooks I would assume that this would
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
that would have to be a review of
 
00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
textbooks that are currently being used
 
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
that was not my intent
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
yeah it just says textbooks approvals
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
right but whether or not that means
 
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
approving the ones that are there now or
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
I would not take it as such but that's
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.409 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
so my experience on the other end of the
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
spectrum being a teacher
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
um is that when things came to the to
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
the school board oftentimes they went to
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
the table of contents or they went to
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
the index looking for
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
specific words or phrases that were kind
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
of catchphrases in the current whatever
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
the current whether it was the Cold War
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
era or you know whatever they their
 
00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:38.029 align:start position:0%
era or you know whatever they their
particular

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
particular
um

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
I guess I their their particular
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
ideology or whatever
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
um they were there for
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
um presented
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and at that time uh things would come
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
to the school board the school board
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
would point it out that it was there and
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
then uh the text textbook or the teacher
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
who was using that textbook would come
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
in and and talk about how it was
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
presented and whether it was a balanced
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
present presentation or not
 
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.130 align:start position:0%
present presentation or not
um

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
so I I think that um you know textbook
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
approval uh
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
is is problematic uh you know again
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
even as a trained educator I would be
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
feel confident in making a decision
 
00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:36.110 align:start position:0%
feel confident in making a decision
about

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
textbooks and content area particularly
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
at the at the high school level that I
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
knew little or nothing about really
 
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.169 align:start position:0%
knew little or nothing about really
um

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit vague and needs to
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
be looked in thank you
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.370 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:57.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
chair uh very interesting bill to me is
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
a former teacher and a former elected
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
board member
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
um as the representative mullen's
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
comment which I found very interesting
 
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
um about reading every book I would
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
probably want to point out that as
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
legislators I'm not sure that all of us
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
read every single bill before we vote on
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
on the bills and what we do here is we
 
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:27.380 align:start position:0%
defer to subject experts in other words
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee recommendations that type of
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
thing so uh but when there's a
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
particular area or or item of particular
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
interest you know that's where we would
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
drill down I think and and certainly
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
have to read you know I wouldn't
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily read every chemistry book I
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
would just trust that the the science
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
department right but representative
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli's point about the cohort
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
something like that that would come up I
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
think every everyone buddy on the board
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
should look at the at that piece of it
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
that is you know potentially
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
controversial but I think deferring to
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
subject experts whether it's in the
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
legislature or in the school Community
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
you think we have to we have to do that
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Moffett that
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
was exactly my point you know don't we
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
have people in positions with content
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
knowledge that uh can make
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
recommendations or not and wouldn't we
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
um representative cordelli would what
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt is referring to
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh I I think school boards have that
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
experience I think parents come forward
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
with controversial information in their
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
in their estimation and ask for a review
 
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.610 align:start position:0%
in their estimation and ask for a review
um

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how this would
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
alleviate that situation because I think
 
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.289 align:start position:0%
alleviate that situation because I think
that

00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
you know you put five people in the room
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and put a problem in front of them they
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
see five different things right so uh I
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
just don't know to what end that would
 
00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:01.029 align:start position:0%
just don't know to what end that would
serve

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
serve
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
thank you

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%

Express their opinion via a vote on some
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
of these individual line item items such
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
as textbooks and as to whether they
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
should be brought forward as future
 
00:23:06.659 --> 00:23:09.409 align:start position:0%
should be brought forward as future
legislation

00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.260 align:start position:0%
would anyone like to
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
right or would you like to vote as a
 
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee just on the uh the bill
 
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.310 align:start position:0%
subcommittee just on the uh the bill
itself

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
am I correct that I mean that's the task
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
today is a is a up or down right but but
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
we I think it's uh within our purview to
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
say that we think that uh sections could
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
be brought forward as future legislation
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
okay I I mean I don't mind having that
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
discussion but I'd like to go through
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%
the bill first okay is that agreeable
 
00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
may I ask a question thank you cordelli
 
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.110 align:start position:0%
may I ask a question thank you cordelli
um so

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
I don't I guess I don't know how to
 
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
phrase this but I'm kind of wondering
 
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
phrase this but I'm kind of wondering
um

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
the school board is the first line of
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
defense for parents if parents are
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
questioning materials they go to the
 
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
school board is is that
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
correct no if they're questioning
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
materials what is what is the opinion of
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
I thought representative Hall I was
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to say the teacher
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know if there's something going on
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
something material in my class then I
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
would think that that parent would come
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
to me first
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
and then it could get to the school
 
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.789 align:start position:0%
and then it could get to the school
board

00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.289 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I taught sex education so you can
 
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:52.220 align:start position:0%
imagine that
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
my job and noting that it was a very
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
sensitive subject and and noting that we
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
needed a lot of Parental involvement
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
with that we actually proactively
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
um had sessions where people came in uh
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
were able to see the films we were
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
showing in class were able to actually
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
see the content of the of the course
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
because we had no textbook because
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
things changed so rapidly at that time
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
if any parent wished to
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
um you know we had obviously that was
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
kind of like a focus group it was open
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
you know to to anybody that would like
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
to come
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
um but if a parent then objected to any
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
particular part of that they're allowed
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
to substitute what they feel uh they
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
want to do or uh alternative curriculum
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
alternative texts that sort of thing so
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
that's that's usually the first line of
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
defense I think in the unfortunately I
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was covid or whatever
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
but I I think unfortunately in this
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh climate right now a lot of people
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
jump the gun and they just they go to
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
the public or they go to the school
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
board and scream and yell and
 
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
um you know protest what what they they
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
think uh there
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
um it's much more
 
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.669 align:start position:0%
um it's much more
um

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's much more
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh gentle on the student uh who becomes
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
this the kind of the Pawn in the whole
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
deal it's much more gentle on them and
 
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
gentle in the whole situation if it's
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
done uh with the teacher and at the
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
local level and and uh you know
 
00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:35.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
I agree with you
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
um rep Tanner that um that's probably
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the best way to go first
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
um but a teacher being transparent is a
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
um important piece of that so I
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you uh what you added
 
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.350 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you uh what you added
thanks

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
I kind of think of the school board as
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
as not the first line of defense but not
 
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
quite the last line of defense before
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
you get to the doe but last line of
 
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
local defense but they're the ones who
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
should be responsible and that's the
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
then that's the part of this is they're
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
the ones that should be responsible or
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
are responsible ultimately for what's
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
taught in the schools and so
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
they need to approve I think the
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
textbooks now
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
whether they do it by saying okay
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
who knows about this what do you think
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
of this textbook I mean I certainly
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
would go to more than just the science
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
teacher who is recommending the textbook
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of resources out there to
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
to check out the textbook and say what
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
do you guys think of this I mean you can
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
go online and and
 
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:51.500 align:start position:0%
even in here a lot of different things
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
but ultimately they're the one that's
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
responsible for the school for what's
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
taught in the school for all of that and
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
how can they do that if they haven't
 
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
sure so I think the the comment between
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett and
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen before
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
um have you know schools are are
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
um have a hierarchy just like you said
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
that you know the teacher's the first
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
and and teachers try to be transparent
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
and obviously the longer you teach the
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
better you get at being transparent
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but the the hierarchy is the teacher
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
then you that and then within that
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
particular school you have a a building
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
principal who also should be involved in
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know I always went to the building
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
principle if I thought I had a film that
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to might drum up some
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
controversy uh then the the principal
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
actually goes to the superintendent and
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
at the superintendent's level is the
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
specialist usually on the curriculum
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
um you know they're the ones they're
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
hired by the school board to actually
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
Implement and oversee all this
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
all these things that you're now shoving
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
to the school board the school board is
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
a is is they're not educational experts
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
for the most part they're not they're
 
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:15.299 align:start position:0%
not paid exceptionally well they're
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
they're like Volunteers in the community
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
they're that are running for office that
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
all of us are running for office now
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
know how fragile that is and
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
um you know to start putting all this on
 
00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.409 align:start position:0%
um you know to start putting all this on
them

00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:30.419 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:29:30.419 --> 00:29:30.950 align:start position:0%
them
um

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
as they have to micromanage curriculum
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
textbooks blah blah blah they if if the
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
superintendent is doing their job if the
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
principals are doing their job if the
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
teacher's doing their job then you know
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
it would be like like Ian musk going in
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
and talking about you know the various
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the rockets that are going to
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
send the the people up you know the
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
micromanaging the seals and all that
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
stuff I mean it's in a in a hierarchy
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I think you're just throwing a lot up
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
to the top that should be
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
coming through
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
thank you version of Hobson
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
sorry to belabor this but so as a school
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
board member I felt like parents would
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
come to me and say did you know about
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
this do you know about that
 
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.010 align:start position:0%
this do you know about that
um

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
most often times I didn't or I didn't
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
have enough knowledge I couldn't explain
 
00:30:29.399 --> 00:30:30.889 align:start position:0%
have enough knowledge I couldn't explain
it

00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and as a parent I got onto the school
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
board because I wanted to have a more
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
investment into what my kids were
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
learning I wanted to understand it I
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to help so I guess at this point
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know what
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
what is the school board responsible for
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
what are we being held responsible for
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
in the community and I look at it like a
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
go-between between the parents kind of
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
like what a representative is you know
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's my job to explain things that are
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
happening in the school I'm a
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative of the community
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
at the school level so
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
um that brings up some confusion for me
 
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.630 align:start position:0%
um that brings up some confusion for me
um

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
with with um you know your position or
 
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
the other side I guess if you could help
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
me explain would the school boards
 
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh chairman cordelli
 
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.690 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh chairman cordelli
um

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
trying to make it where I I want to
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
start with this um you know and
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hopson um you know pretty
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years and some of the
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
same concerns and issues proper School
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
Board role
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
um I I tend to tell people to start with
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education rules
 
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.210 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education rules
ed30303.01

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
is the um is the rule for uh I'm sorry
 
00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:11.690 align:start position:0%
is the um is the rule for uh I'm sorry
303.02

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
303.02
 
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:16.220 align:start position:0%
duties of school superintendents in 303
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
303.01 is the is the substantive duties
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
of school boards
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
um and we also have to take a look at
 
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.310 align:start position:0%
um and we also have to take a look at
RSA

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
194-c colon 4. that's the duties of
 
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.750 align:start position:0%
194-c colon 4. that's the duties of
superintendents

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:33.740 align:start position:0%
um and if we look at 194 C4 it's um
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
recruitment supervision evaluation of
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
Staff Development review and evaluation
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
of curriculum coordination and
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
implementation of various curricula
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
provisions of Staff training compliance
 
00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:48.860 align:start position:0%
with laws regulations pupil achievement
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
assessment through uh grading and state
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
and National assessment procedures So
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
currently if we're talking about sort of
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
the operational aspects of a school
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
board you know we say the school board
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
governs the district and I think you've
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
been to some of our trainings budget
 
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:09.419 align:start position:0%
policy collective bargaining evaluate
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
the superintendent compliance with their
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
right to no law um public information
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
programs things of that nature
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
conversely the superintendent when I
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
when I say the superintendent and
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
obviously some of this is going to be
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
delegated to the administrative team
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
special ed director business manager
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
principals are more responsible for sort
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
of the day-to-day operations of this of
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
the school bus if a school or it could
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
see the school buses I'm getting out of
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
my first example the school district so
 
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059 align:start position:0%
if a bus is running late and a
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
constituent calls the parent that's all
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
well and good but chances are it's going
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
to be the superintendent that's going to
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
be in touch with the curriculum
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
coordinator if the boiler blows up and
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
there's no heat in that day I mean yes
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
the school board should be informed of
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
that but it's going to be the
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent working with the facility
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
guy or the maintenance guy or whoever
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
the contractor to come in and get it
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
fixed so if we look at again if we look
 
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:01.580 align:start position:0%
at rsa194 C4 the superintendent services
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
and then look at that in conjunction
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
with Department of Education rule 302
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
those are the administrative
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent responsibilities and just
 
00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:11.179 align:start position:0%
looking at sort of
 
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.849 align:start position:0%
looking at sort of
302.01

00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:12.859 align:start position:0%
302.01
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent Shall Serve as the
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
executive officer of the local school
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
districts within the SAU be responsible
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
for the overall Administration
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
such local school district Services
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
shall be included but not limited to the
 
00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:29.179 align:start position:0%
following areas Personnel Finance
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction assessment you
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
know they put that they put that in the
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
duties of the superintendents and the
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
doors because as I think I mentioned
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
when when I gave my testimony last
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
January I believe this bill was heard
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's you know again School boards are
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
again we've had some of the conversation
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
here school board members are not
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
educational experts we have
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
chemistry teachers and we have social
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
studies teachers and we have you know
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
things of things of that nature I guess
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
the other concern that sort of nhsba has
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
in retirement I don't want to belabor
 
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
this point either when we're talking
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
about school board sort of approving the
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum and the textbooks and I think
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett you've certainly
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
touched on this and can coordination
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
with representative Mullen you'd be
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
asking the school board member to be a
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
Content expert in everything that's
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
being taught in that school from pre-k
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
to AP Calculus we are 12th year of high
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
school that's a tall task for for an
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
average School Board member you know to
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
your to the extent representative Hobson
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
when you were on the school board you
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
get a concern about from a constituent
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know we would always say at nhsba
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's all that's great listen to the
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
concern listen to the complaint but it's
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an individual school
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
boards member job to quote unquote solve
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
the problem because the law doesn't
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
necessarily give you Authority directed
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate person is a you know
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
that back to the teacher back to the
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
principal back to the superintendent if
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's something that you know may rise to
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
a board level issue a hearing of some
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
sort or a review you're going to
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
non-public section to talk with the
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
parents that that may that it may get to
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
that point but initially there's sort of
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
a chain of communication as I believe
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
somebody over on this side mentioned so
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a long-winded answer
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
to the simple question of who's
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
responsible for what you know we have
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education rules
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
um that speak to some of these things in
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
coordination with RSA 189 1A and then
 
00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
the superintendents you know
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility over the educational
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
programming if you will and 194 C4
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
oh thank you I just wanted to make sure
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
I understood
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh the School Board Association
 
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.170 align:start position:0%
um so uh the School Board Association
position

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um vau would be that
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
um uh curriculum and textbooks
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
um would not necessarily be approved by
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
the school board thank you for the
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
question uh chairman cordially I believe
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
my testimony last time said if a school
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
board wants to do that they can under
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
current law you don't need the the sort
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
of enabling legislation or the enabling
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
language that's in that's in the bill
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
and I think I also said you know some
 
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:08.339 align:start position:0%
School Board some school boards probably
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
are involved in in looking at the books
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
and getting reports from the curriculum
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
coordinator and the superintendent and
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
other school boards aren't I don't think
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
school boards are precluded from doing
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
that right now under current law
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
um representative bum
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I was on the school board
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
also and we approved curriculum and we
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
also told the superintendent to get rid
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
of some curriculum right I mean we had
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
an American history book and I didn't
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
know about it until my granddaughter who
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
was in the ninth grade at the time
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
showed it to me I said what
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
and it was completely biased it wasn't
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
no American history said so so put two
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
sides and whatnot then found written by
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
some organ Professor you know of course
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
so we got rid of that book the next year
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean we approved curriculum we
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
hadn't presented to us and yet we didn't
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
said yeah we listened to a testimony and
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we listen right right but
 
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
yeah we can't read everything unless
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
your kid brings it up to you sure but
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah but yeah we approved all our
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum the other challenge too
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
um just from a sort of an operational
 
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.970 align:start position:0%
um just from a sort of an operational
standpoint

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
um what I would be concerned about is
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know curriculum changing every time
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
there's a new school board election
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
right you know it's just you know it
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
they they go back and forth we all we
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
all know that you know you can't and
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum is expensive too textbooks
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
are not cheap the software programs are
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
not cheap you know so you know you have
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
a curriculum you don't like or the new
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
the quote-unquote new school board
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily like the new school
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
board members all it takes is one vote
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
to flip you spend a hundred thousand
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
dollars last year on map books or
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be and you know you're
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
gonna you're gonna switch that up and
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
spend another hundred thousand dollars
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
in two years because the vote flipped
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
when one person you know change sides so
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
there's just sort of a an operational
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
aspect of that too that we should be
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
very very mindful of as well
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
yeah this is like every five years we do
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
it and this was one year left though
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
right it wasn't that much of a deal and
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
that was the only time that that you
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
know I mean what I what I would tell
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
school boards too to anybody that home
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
that that's listening you know if if
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
you've got questions about this put it
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
on the put it on this agenda say I want
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
a report from the superintendent the
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent and or the
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum coordinator if you have one
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
how talk talk to the school board about
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
the process that the administration goes
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
through for reviewing and making a
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
presentation or a recommendation to the
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you know and and there are other ways
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
around that as well too some boards some
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
boards may have like a curriculum
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
committee where it's not the full board
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
but you've got one School Board member
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
who sits in with the principals and the
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent so there's at least
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
somebody on the board that has a sense
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's going back and then they can come
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
back and report to the full board as
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
well too
 
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.069 align:start position:0%
well too
yeah

00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
um maybe we can to the uh next section
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
section three being on line 24.
 
00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:19.609 align:start position:0%
section three being on line 24.
um

00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
which discusses uh District policies uh
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.450 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
um comments on on those uh approval of
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
the budget Etc I think they're pretty
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh I have I on that page uh
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
certainly we would all like to set as a
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
goal that everyone conformed to
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
standards of ethical Behavior whether
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
you're a member of the school board or a
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
member of the public but
 
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:57.500 align:start position:0%
um how do we Define that what
 
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:02.660 align:start position:0%
that to me is a very sort of vague
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
my language and someone else's language
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
may be uh on two different planes right
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
and what I consider not conforming to
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
the standards of ethical Behavior
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh I believe my intent there was many
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
boards have a an Ethics policy for
 
00:41:26.339 --> 00:41:27.410 align:start position:0%
boards have a an Ethics policy for
conduct

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
um by board members so that was the
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
intent there
 
00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
three

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes so are we going over onto the
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
next page as well sure we can address
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
any of those
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
okay uh line seven
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
public input at multiple times during
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
board meetings
 
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know how a board would
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
accomplish that I don't know what
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
multiple times means does that mean
 
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:02.579 align:start position:0%
twice does it mean six times is there a
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
time limit uh
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
so that would be the next thing that I
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
would I would question right and I I
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
think we did have legislation that we
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
did pass last year that dealt with that
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
topic so I think that that's pretty much
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
in statute so are you suggesting that it
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
be struck from here right that it would
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
not be needed at this point all right
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
someone could certainly modify what we
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
passed last year to provide some other
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
language absolutely the process allows
 
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:42:44.579 --> 00:42:47.150 align:start position:0%
further discussion
um

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh I was wondering about the feelings on
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
classroom visitations
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
this just recommends a policy on
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
classroom visitations not any specific
 
00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:04.849 align:start position:0%
classroom visitations not any specific
requirements

00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
I think that that
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
um there should be a policy on classroom
 
00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:15.349 align:start position:0%
um there should be a policy on classroom
visitations

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
visitations
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
um if you you know it it isn't an open
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
book like that uh parents can call in
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
the morning and come into the classroom
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
or just walk into the classroom I think
 
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.589 align:start position:0%
or just walk into the classroom I think
that's

00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's a dangerous situation you you
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
might have a parent who's really
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
agitated from who knows what
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly the vast majority
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
of parents are are calm and cool and
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
they really like the way things are
 
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
going but the small percentage that
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
might come in and really create havoc
 
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.770 align:start position:0%
might come in and really create havoc
and

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
um be very disruptive so I think think
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
of policy um and I I think our school
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
had a policy on on school visitation as
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
as well as people coming in to talk uh
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
in our classes uh you know outside
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
things and I I just I would say that um
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
in order for a school to function that
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
probably is something that that happens
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
in most of the school districts
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I I can't imagine a school district
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
that didn't have a policy of some type
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
represent Paul
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
is that a question can we just back up
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
to line nine for a minute
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
um what does that look like
 
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
policy to promote parental engagement
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
what would that say
 
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
what would that say
uh

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
and I realize it says student
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
achievement progress but what is it
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious what a policy like that
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
um I I believe
 
00:44:44.579 --> 00:44:45.190 align:start position:0%
um I I believe
um

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
as the drafter of this
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
um the idea was that we needed to uh
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
encourage parental engagement it's a
 
00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
fundamental from everyone from the
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
teachers unions to uh
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
um policy uh people that we need to have
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
parents involved with the school and so
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
it was just a really more a statement
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
that there should be
 
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.150 align:start position:0%
that there should be
that

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
goal and there should be policies
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
related to that which could depend on
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
the school and the school board what
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
their feelings were and how they wanted
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
to structure how that parental
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
engagement was conducted we've had
 
00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:35.349 align:start position:0%
engagement was conducted we've had
legislation

00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
numerous times about parental engagement
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
I remember one bill
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh in particular
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
um was just a commission to study
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
um uh engaging parents with uh
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
non-academic subjects when they were
 
00:45:53.569 --> 00:45:53.579 align:start position:0%
going to be discussed
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
mental health was a key consideration
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
there and unfortunately that commission
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
was not uh passed that legislation for
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
the commission was not passed but I
 
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
think parental engagement was a very
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
important topic and so that was just
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
really a statement as much as anything
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
in in there
 
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.849 align:start position:0%
in in there
it

00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
when you were talking about something
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
not needed
 
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.130 align:start position:0%
not needed
Etc

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
I thought the intent of this was to lay
 
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
out in one place
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
so that a school board member could go
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
and look and say okay what are my
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and go through and see
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
what they are
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
so just because we have a law someplace
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
else that clarifies that
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
you know public content
 
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.250 align:start position:0%
you know public content
sorry

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
um for instance what that means I I
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
still think it needs to be in here
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
because this is I see it as the general
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
guide am I mistaken in that
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I I think that was
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I was trying to
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
accomplish and certainly
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
um if there was something else uh
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in statute I mean from 194 for
 
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.190 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in statute I mean from 194 for
instance

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
um you could say in here pursuant to
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
Etc yeah that would be the thing to do
 
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.109 align:start position:0%
Etc yeah that would be the thing to do
right

00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
representative and and I guess that
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
speaks to my point
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
um earlier that first of all I'd like to
 
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
see side by side with the rules of of
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
that are currently in the the doe as
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
well as the statute so so that we see it
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
all lined up number one what is
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
currently there and and what is in this
 
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.710 align:start position:0%
currently there and and what is in this
particular

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
um bill but also the fact that that when
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
we make statues then it goes gel car and
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
the doe then makes the rules and it
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that it would be
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
instead of in statue
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about should be
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
from the doe in the rules combining all
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
the things giving the direction to the
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
school board to the superintendent
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
from what the statutes are and that then
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association also would
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
take that as a listing and I'm sure they
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
um in their training go through what is
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities and answer
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
questions about the board but
 
00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:32.819 align:start position:0%
um to to keep piling more in this book
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
and to put more regulation
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
on school on just Public Schools we're
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
not doing this for Charters we're not
 
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
doing this for private or any schools
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
that accept our taxpayer money but
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
um for just Public Schools I think
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
I think we need to really file it down
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
and and see where it really belongs
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
whether it belongs in statutes or it
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
belongs to doe rules
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
uh I would I would just say that there
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
my way of thinking there should be
 
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
nothing in rules that does not refer
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
back to statute I think it is a problem
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
um the executive branch developing rules
 
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
that are go beyond statute
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes I I
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
with all due respect have a different
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the process and that
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
is that the statute is sort of the
 
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
overarching umbrella and then the
 
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
specifics are in rules
 
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.329 align:start position:0%
specifics are in rules
so

00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
um right but I think the cumbersomeness
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
of putting job descriptions into statute
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that's really what we're doing we're
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
putting the job description of a school
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
board member into statute I mean where
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
do we go next are we then going to put
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
the principal's job into statute the
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
teacher's job the state police Trooper
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
the toll booth worker I I don't know
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
where we stop if
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is the RSA States
 
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:17.660 align:start position:0%
the obvious that it is it it is the
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
overarching kind of broad definition and
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
then the fine tuning is done in the in
 
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
um maybe we could keep on going down
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
um the list
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
um uh next would be uh transparency and
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
there were a number of things listed
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
under that beginning on line 14 on page
 
00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.650 align:start position:0%
under that beginning on line 14 on page
two

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:45.619 align:start position:0%
um any comments on
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
any of those items there are six of them
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
I believe acceptance of contracts
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
posting of manifests
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
Etc

00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt thank you Mr uh
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
yes and I do want to Circle back real
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
quick and just say I agree with
 
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:11.339 align:start position:0%
representative mullen's concerns on the
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh the standards of ethical Behavior I
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
flagged the same question with the same
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
point on that
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
um and on the line right above uh
 
00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.390 align:start position:0%
um and on the line right above uh
uh

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
where it says to allow classroom
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
visitations that's that's uh through we
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
have a Bill Bill I'm involved with some
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
of you already are aware of that
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
um the issue of being too prescriptive I
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
think that was kind of Representative
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
mullen's Point that's I share the same
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
concern in terms of being too too
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
prescriptive in statute uh I I think we
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
should be wary of that now the the other
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
bill that we're going to deal with later
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
this month on classroom visitations and
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
classroom transparency
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
that bill does not it was that was a
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor that build is not
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
prescribed any specific policy or or
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
funding all it does is ask for a report
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
in the 10 of that is I've gone over many
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
times is just to get boards locally to
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
talk about or address transparency
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
recording classroom visitation policies
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
so on line 14 uh where in just to back
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
up real quick one more comment on that
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
the problem I have with the work with
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
the wording of uh the online 12 Section
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
3 developing and implementing a policy
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
to allow classroom visitations now I'm
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
big on transparency I think you all know
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
that and I I think classroom visitations
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
the part of the mix but the problem with
 
00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
saying that we sh we will Implement a
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
policy to allow classroom visitations
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
now if that's in statute I can see some
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
cases where students in IEP or there's
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
some unique circumstances where the they
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
don't would not want it would not be
 
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate for someone anyone to come
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
in and watch that instruction in a
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
unique case but if this were to pass as
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
worded then it would be in statute that
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
by law the the districts would have to
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
allow classroom visitations so if you're
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
tracking that that's just my question
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned about being overly
 
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
prescriptive so on line 14 voting on all
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
contracts acceptance of gifts and grants
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
uh you know gifts and you know a major
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
Grant is a major Grant but sometimes in
 
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:37.220 align:start position:0%
the short term you know all kinds of
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
gifts or or things come to a a school
 
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.609 align:start position:0%
gifts or or things come to a a school
office

00:53:42.609 --> 00:53:42.619 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
and by again if this is law there would
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
there have to be a board meeting to
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
accept a gift of a few hundred dollars
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
to to improve an athletic field I that
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's just my concerns being overly
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
prescriptive if if you're tracking that
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli do you happen to
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
know in terms of uh collective
 
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.569 align:start position:0%
know in terms of uh collective
bargaining

00:54:10.569 --> 00:54:10.579 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not voting requiring that all
 
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
being done in public
 
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.170 align:start position:0%
being done in public
um

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:23.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know whether or not
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
that would stand in challenge to any of
 
00:54:31.329 --> 00:54:31.339 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining procedures
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
I would think that it would um not doing
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
it in a vote in public but in a
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
non-public meeting or something like
 
00:54:39.059 --> 00:54:40.569 align:start position:0%
non-public meeting or something like
that

00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:40.579 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
would be a violation 91a
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
right right but it doesn't I'm not
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
talking about voting on are we accepting
 
00:54:53.049 --> 00:54:53.059 align:start position:0%
the contract or not I'm talking about
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know in collective bargaining
 
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.210 align:start position:0%
you know in collective bargaining
when

00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
teacher negotiators and School Board
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
negotiators are meeting
 
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
are those considered to be public
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
meetings I don't believe so there there
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
um bills put forward I think to expand
 
00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:18.740 align:start position:0%
some of those meetings as being public
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm just but not well that was
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding my
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
understanding was that those were not so
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
when you say voting on all contracts
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
that's a little nebulous uh in terms of
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
if you've got a if you've got school
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
district negotiators and teacher
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
negotiators sitting around and they say
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay well can we all agree on this well
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about that let's take a
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
vote on it is I I think this would be a
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
board we're talking about uh
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the school board so
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
this would be a school board vote on a
 
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.910 align:start position:0%
this would be a school board vote on a
contract

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
okay I I I guess what I'm saying is that
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
I saw room for interpretation in that
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
language so that might be problematic
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:02.339 --> 00:56:04.069 align:start position:0%
thank you
Christina

00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I also see kind of problematic again
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
I guess with the over prescriptiveness
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
of posting uh invoices on a regular
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
basis on the district website
 
00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:16.430 align:start position:0%
basis on the district website
um

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
again we have a business manager you
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
know all school districts super
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
supervisory units have a business
 
00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:24.049 align:start position:0%
supervisory units have a business
manager

00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
manager
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
um certainly the school board
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
um has access to these invoices uh but
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
to post it on the district website I
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
just think is
 
00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.809 align:start position:0%
just think is
uh

00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
Overkill over prescriptive
 
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.870 align:start position:0%
Overkill over prescriptive
um

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
um any other comments on any of those
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering about posting of uh
 
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
um professional development topics for
 
00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.109 align:start position:0%
um professional development topics for
instance

00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.089 --> 00:56:59.099 align:start position:0%
yeah I I really
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
um don't see the intent of this I mean
 
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.569 align:start position:0%
um don't see the intent of this I mean
um

00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
the school districts now offer their
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's teachers of professional
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
development usually as part of the
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
pre-school year or post-school year
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
but other times particularly Specialists
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh that deal in
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
well like I did in health and physical
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
education or art music or special
 
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.290 align:start position:0%
education or art music or special
education

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
um we often went to workshops that were
 
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
um not spot not directly sponsored by
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
the school and I just I I don't know
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
what the intent is of that to um
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
have it posted on the district website
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
what what it's it's part of our
 
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
professional development part of our
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
um certification okay thank you
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
um how about uh the next section
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
um number six on line 23
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
um that talks about posting enrollment
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
achievement information
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
um or a link
 
00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:08.660 align:start position:0%
to the department of educational website
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
which the new
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I report a facility on the Department
 
00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
of Education has a great wealth of
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
information about
 
00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:25.460 align:start position:0%
um schools school districts ranging from
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
academics to financial
 
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.030 align:start position:0%
academics to financial
information

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
would would you see just a school
 
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
district website just having a link for
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
information to that at the Department of
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
I I would definitely
 
00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
um say a link to the department is is uh
 
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
really you know something that should be
 
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.210 align:start position:0%
really you know something that should be
there

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
um my biggest
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh complaint I guess or or
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
comment about that particular thing that
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
particular statement is that I really
 
00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:08.339 align:start position:0%
bristle every time we have this per
 
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
pupil cost because what happens is that
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
somebody in the district comes in they
 
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
have a special ed student that's a
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden everybody in the
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
school per pupil cost is like Sky High
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
and um it really that if you are just
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
taking the total budget of the school
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
dividing it by the total number of
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
pupils and saying that that's the cost
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
per student that's not an accurate
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
vision of what um actually is the cost
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
per student at a school right I I think
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the Department of
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
Education website there is
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
um information on how they calculate uh
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
per pure cost there are exclusions from
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
I I know I'm not on this committee but I
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
was at the one about I report and I
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
report isn't the name of the isn't the
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
name of the program though that's one of
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
the subcategories and I can't remember
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.329 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:00:22.329 --> 01:00:22.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
and I agree that definitely should be on
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
every school district's website because
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
that that is an excellent
 
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:35.390 align:start position:0%
that that is an excellent
so

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
fascinating the amount of information
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
they're making available there
 
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.569 align:start position:0%
they're making available there
um

01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
how about the last section the uh
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
requirement of a survey end of year
 
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
requirement of a survey end of year
survey

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
survey
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I I will note that I I did have an
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
amendment at the end of the uh
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill that that
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
removed that section but uh just
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
throwing that open to see what the
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's thoughts were on an end
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
of year survey of parents
 
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:08.339 align:start position:0%
good enough
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
I would not be in support of it but
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
um what is the intent of that anyway
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
what what do you see at the end game
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
um we did uh put in place for
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
um tax credit scholarship
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
program and for Education Freedom
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
accounts the requirement for Parental
 
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.849 align:start position:0%
accounts the requirement for Parental
surveys

01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
is the parental survey in those issues
 
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
cover all these areas
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
it for the the ones we currently do for
 
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
the fa and for the uh education tax
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
credit I honestly I have to go back and
 
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.690 align:start position:0%
credit I honestly I have to go back and
look

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
how can you tell how you're doing if you
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
don't get an evaluation
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
I mean whenever we did whenever I did
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
any kind of training or when I was in
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
college at the end of classes
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
we did an evaluation that had a lot of
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
this stuff on it and that's how you got
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
feedback to know how to get better and
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
so that would be to me the purpose of
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
this is so that the schools know what's
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah did they post your uh
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
represent Mullen uh not only
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
am I okay with a parent survey uh I know
 
01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:44.579 align:start position:0%
that some school districts already do
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
this and uh I would think that it would
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
be equally as important to get this
 
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
information from the students in in the
 
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:58.430 align:start position:0%
information from the students in in the
building

01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
thank you to share uh yes I agree with
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
Rob Simone again I I think uh it may be
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
not quite in sync with representative
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hall in this uh I think parental surveys
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
uh I support that engagement of parents
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
involving parents getting input for
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
parents uh I I think is important uh my
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
only concern is as with any survey or
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
instrument uh you know who's putting it
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
together you know as you all know uh I'm
 
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.690 align:start position:0%
together you know as you all know uh I'm
sure

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
some surveys can have leading questions
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
and they can the the questions can
 
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:41.780 align:start position:0%
invite certain responses uh for
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
ideological reasons and so that that's
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
my only concern parent involvement yes
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh the student involvement piece
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
um again I uh I in theory it's great to
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
allow the students as well but I some of
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
these students are not that well
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
informed or educated and I I'd be a
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
little nervous about
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
student surveys but I know some some
 
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
places do that some boards have student
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
members uh which is different from a
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
student survey I anyway uh that
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
parents yes students in some way I'm not
 
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
sure how thanks thank you I would just
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
just a comment uh representative Moffett
 
01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:27.740 align:start position:0%
that uh in my experience we have had
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting surveys back from
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
parents so so I I think it would have to
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
be something that was looked at
 
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
exceptionally carefully to look at those
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
student uh the parent sample size and
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not the amount of return
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
would even have the survey be considered
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
to be reliable or valid
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
good good point
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
just point out that
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
um really since
 
01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.530 align:start position:0%
um really since
um

01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was drafted the Department of
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
Education now does an annual survey
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
called 603
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
Bright Futures survey I think is the
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
title of it that includes
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
Provisions for
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
parents staff teachers and the community
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
for all to answer the survey in a
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
complete a question questions related to
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
their areas really
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
including special needs I remember
 
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
looking at specifically
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
um so you know I'm not sure if that
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
might take the place of uh requiring in
 
01:05:44.809 --> 01:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
school districts to do that individually
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
but um that is something someone could
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
take a look at uh to see if they feel
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
um that might replace a school school
 
01:05:57.849 --> 01:05:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh and so is the time winding down for
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.630 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
I'm just I've heard several areas that
 
01:06:09.839 --> 01:06:10.569 align:start position:0%
I'm just I've heard several areas that
um

01:06:10.569 --> 01:06:10.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
uh maybe there could be some agreement
 
01:06:16.329 --> 01:06:16.339 align:start position:0%
that might
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
be the subject of future legislation as
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
a recommendation from the uh
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but also I guess start out
 
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
with uh 1137 itself if anyone feels that
 
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.809 align:start position:0%
with uh 1137 itself if anyone feels that
um

01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
it should be brought back as future
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
legislation or maybe just components of
 
01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.569 align:start position:0%
legislation or maybe just components of
it

01:06:41.569 --> 01:06:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of this obviously it
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
sounds like we need a few tweaking and
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
wording and leaving this and that out
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
but if we so in our recommendation
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
in our report that we send forward
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
should we not have as notes that you
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
know those the things we talked about
 
01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.270 align:start position:0%
know those the things we talked about
right

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
I think moving this for you know saying
 
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
yes this should go forward but these are
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
the things these are the issues that we
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
think should be fixed changed you know
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
whatever or kept in or
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
you know whatever does that
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and and I uh representative Lucas
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
will be surprised to hear this would go
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
in the other direction and say that
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
straight up should we go forward with 11
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
37 no because there are too many
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions with regards to the
 
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
side by side with the Ed 300 rules and
 
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:50.420 align:start position:0%
what's currently in statute and
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh some of the areas that we talked
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
about that we think may have gotten
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
covered in other bills last session so I
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
would say no to 11 37 uh that we would
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
not go forward with this bill
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
and then certainly it's the chair's
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
purview as to whether or not you include
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
information uh regarding what potential
 
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
one that I definitely heard was a link
 
01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:24.020 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
I think you know some of these things I
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
think again
 
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
um don't need to be in statute I think
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh the for example the link I think
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
that's something that could come out of
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
doe that here's this link and we would
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
like to have this you know on all the I
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
mean I just think a lot of this that
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're going over
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
uh is either already in statute or is
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
something that the doe needs to if it
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be all put together in one
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
package then the doe needs to do that
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
um whether it's done with a side by side
 
01:09:04.199 --> 01:09:07.550 align:start position:0%
um whether it's done with a side by side
I

01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
I just again feel like we've we've gone
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
through this it's it's over prescriptive
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
we don't really know uh how the new
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislation fits into it we don't know
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh really how the rules that are
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
established by the doe line up with 189
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
194 the ones that that cover
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
superintendents and School Board
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
directions and if we want it all in one
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
package it seems to me that the doe
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
needs to do that and that some of the
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
things that we agreed on for example uh
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
the survey
 
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
um that that it's just a it's something
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
that comes out of the doe as a
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion to the school districts and
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
see how that goes I mean some school
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
districts may be
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
you know have thousands and thousands
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
and thousands of students and others
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
it's my experience and from what we've
 
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
seen here or what I've seen here over
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
the last four years is that there are a
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
lot of things that school districts
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
don't do if you don't put it in statute
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
and so saying suggestion from the DOE
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
that you know some schools are really
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
good about that but others it's not me
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
it's they're not told they have to it's
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
one more thing they don't do it so and
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
saying oh but these are the rules and so
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
we need to fit our what we're doing to
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
the rules it's the other way around we
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
say this is what we want to happen and
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
they write the rules to enact what we
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
say is going to happen it's not we look
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
at the rules and say oh what should we
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
pass so I think we need to get the horse
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
in the cart in the right order
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
my my point wasn't that we should look
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
at the rules and then you know let them
 
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
do stuff it it's the the series of what
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
our obligations are and what the
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
prescriptions are at different levels
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need to get have if we're going to
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
make a good decision we need to have
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
good information input right good input
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
to us and by having some sort of listing
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
of all this material together
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
um rather than try to go
 
01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
piece by piece on the internet and find
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
rule 300 whatever and not knowing that
 
01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.290 align:start position:0%
rule 300 whatever and not knowing that
maybe

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:38.300 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
300.25 exists someplace else we need to
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
see it all together and until we see
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
that all together there's no way I would
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
I would vote to to say go ahead with
 
01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wonder if
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
maybe it might be useful to the school
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
systems if we at least put a reference
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
in here to the need to survey the
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
families who do not speak English and
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
make some effort to reach out to that
 
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
sub-population which is growing
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
considerably in our communities and that
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
it usually at least put it on the list
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
so that it's not overlooked that is my
 
01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.990 align:start position:0%
so that it's not overlooked that is my
concern

01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lucas
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
I guess when I was saying go ahead with
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
this legislation I wasn't
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
I wasn't saying this bill the way it is
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
now I was saying that the intent of this
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill I think we should go ahead with but
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do that yeah we're
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
going to want to look at the side by
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
side like you said see what wording
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed I mean that's part
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
of what we've been doing here I've been
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
writing notes all over this about what
 
01:12:57.659 --> 01:12:58.570 align:start position:0%
writing notes all over this about what
things

01:12:58.570 --> 01:12:58.580 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
if we do something like this this coming
 
01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
year what things need to be changed and
 
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
that was what I was saying needs to go
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the notes so to me it was not this
 
01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:13.460 align:start position:0%
bill as worded but this bill has
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
intended with
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
notes these changes or these
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations or whatever that's I
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
think what I was that's what I was
 
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.790 align:start position:0%
think what I was that's what I was
thinking

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
in in reference to the discussion about
 
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.450 align:start position:0%
in in reference to the discussion about
uh

01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
other areas of Statute
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
such as 194c as was mentioned by Barrett
 
01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.490 align:start position:0%
such as 194c as was mentioned by Barrett
Christina

01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:39.500 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
would you see
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
expansion of
 
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:49.940 align:start position:0%
the duties Section 1 189 1A
 
01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:52.580 align:start position:0%
to include
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
some of those other
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
areas of rsas
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
with just a for instance
 
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.790 align:start position:0%
with just a for instance
um

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
I can't think of a specific but uh
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:09.260 align:start position:0%
um something and saying pursuant to
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
another section of Statute 194c
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
Etc underneath
 
01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:16.390 align:start position:0%
Etc underneath
um

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
so that because it goes back to
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
codification of the law the rsas and
 
01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
there is a legislation I think to look
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
at recodification of some of this coming
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
next year but if we're to have a section
 
01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.689 align:start position:0%
next year but if we're to have a section
about

01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:40.699 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
duties for the school board should we
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
combine in this one section other
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
sections such as from 194c here with
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
just references to
 
01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
just references to
um

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
I certainly think that anything that you
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
move forward with
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
should of course in consider 194c and
 
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:13.460 align:start position:0%
the Ed rules uh so that you're not
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
putting language forward that's at Cross
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
purposes to each other so that whatever
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
happens it's clarifying rather than
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
muddying so uh but I certainly would not
 
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:29.209 align:start position:0%
be able to
um

01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
to say that I would recommend moving
 
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
forward with anything more General than
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
a clarification of the roles of school
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's you know because I'm I how can we
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
improve anything if we don't see it
 
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.410 align:start position:0%
improve anything if we don't see it
okay

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.610 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
quickly uh yeah quickly
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
um one of one of the things that
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
surprised me when I first got elected
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
first got on the education committee was
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
that this book is like somebody building
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
a house and just keeps building you know
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
little rooms and little nooks and
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
crannies and and none of them are
 
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
connected and that's that's maybe the
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
only the the one overlying thing that I
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
think is important is that
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
for for the clarity for the people that
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
are doing the work in education and for
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
the clarity for the people that are
 
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:23.540 align:start position:0%
legislating we need to have some some
 
01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
organization rather than pursuant to
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
this and to pursue into that and jumping
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
all over in in the law book
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
um it's really uh amazing to me how this
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
as a general common as to what I'm
 
01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.610 align:start position:0%
as a general common as to what I'm
hearing

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and please correct me if I'm
 
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
not stating it correctly but
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
um 11 37 I'm feeling on the subcommittee
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
saying should not proceed
 
01:17:05.169 --> 01:17:05.179 align:start position:0%
um as as written but if there is to be
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
similar legislation that
 
01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:12.380 align:start position:0%
um discusses the duties of school boards
 
01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:16.580 align:start position:0%
it should be uh
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
including references to the r as other
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
rsas as sort of a re-codification of the
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
duties of school board so that they're
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
all in one place and that any references
 
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
here to others areas of Statute should
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
be specified such as references to some
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
Duty that might be listed in 194c or
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
peace with one with one elaboration on
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
that representative cordelli I just
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
think that care needs to be taken to
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not putting
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
something into statute that works in
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
opposition to what is in Ed rules so I
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
think those Ed rules need to be
 
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh represent Moffett
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
teams here uh yeah which you just said I
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
I agree with which you just gave
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
expression to I also agree with
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative leckis uh I I think I
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of this and I
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
support the overall intent of better
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
defining School Board duties and also
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
empowering parents I think that's part
 
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
of the intent of this uh but this is to
 
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.270 align:start position:0%
of the intent of this uh but this is to
me

01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
um that said this is almost like an
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
Omnibus type thing there are so many
 
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
pieces to this in our job which we're
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
doing is to look at every piece and
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
brainstorm it and what if it and
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
Murphy's Law rep uh and one other
 
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
comment um just to pick out online 26
 
01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
about conducting an annual end of year
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
parental survey with results to be
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
posted in the district website
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I like that idea in principle the the
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
problem I have though is that if a
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
district doesn't do that then they're in
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
violation of the law and somebody in the
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
district will come to school or meeting
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
to say to the administrators you know
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
you're breaking the law you didn't do
 
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
what the law said they said well we'll
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
try to get to it and my concern is that
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
if we have at least prescriptive
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
requirements that get ignored uh all too
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
often already uh I think it results in a
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh disdain for the law uh
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know you know you know nothing's
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
going to happen if we don't do this
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
because it's we don't agree with it
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
anyway nobody enforces it so I I'm not
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
sure what the enforcement mechanism
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
would be for districts that don't comply
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
with this law or this requirements I
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
just think we need to be careful about
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
what we put in the Statue and make sure
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
that you know it it's taken seriously
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
and it's going to actually happen
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I I think uh to follow up
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
on Mr on representative moffett's uh
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
comment I think you know
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
um there's a whole thing about the
 
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
consent of the governed you know that
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
that when you make laws and you may you
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
make regulations uh the more people that
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
you involve and the more parties and
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
that you involve in that decision
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
um certainly uh helps for it to be
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
implemented if everybody agrees that
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
it's a good law and and something that
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
they can actually Implement and
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
something that's meaningful for them
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
so uh I think one of the things we need
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
to look at is again
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
I'm on this committee is that as a
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
teacher as a person involved in
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
education public education I was
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
continually distressed by the political
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
influence and the political intrusion
 
01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:52.580 align:start position:0%
into what was happening and the the
 
01:20:55.729 --> 01:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
over-regulation and underfunding of
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
public schools and we just keep putting
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
piling more regulations and more
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
regulations on to public schools
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's the way that's why
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools kind of broke off is
 
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:08.219 align:start position:0%
because they they didn't want to be as
 
01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
regulated as public schools
 
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
but until you have consent of the Govern
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
so so you've got school districts that
 
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
are overburdened by political policies
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
they've got overburdened by regulations
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do a job with kids
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
with limited in many cases very limited
 
01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:29.219 align:start position:0%
funds limited we were having problems
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
getting teachers now because of our
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
whole situation and just to say okay
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a felony conviction on
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
a superintendent and if the if they
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
don't follow the regulations that we
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
think are important
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things about this
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
particular bill as it moves forward or
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
the intent of it is it should be a
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
commission or a committee and and invite
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
people from the the school boards
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
Association and invite superintendents
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
and invite teachers and maybe even
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
students to come in and testify and have
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
input into what they they think I mean
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
we just can't keep piling stuff on
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um so a recommendation
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
from this subcommittee to the full
 
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:16.610 align:start position:0%
from this subcommittee to the full
committee

01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
um would it be fair to say that we do
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
not support moving 1137 forward as
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
future legislation as written
 
01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:29.090 align:start position:0%
future legislation as written
but

01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
we do not
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
object to the idea that
 
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
um the duties of school boards could be
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
better defined in statute and if there
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
is future legislation to do that that
 
01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:48.380 align:start position:0%
189 1A
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
include references to other areas of the
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
RSA that Define statutes
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
so that their 189 would be more a a
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
listing with references to other
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
areas of Statute so that they're more
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
with regards to representative moffett's
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
comments about this being an Omnibus
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
Bill and representative Tanner's
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
Brilliance at suggesting a study
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
committee or commission to look at the
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
countless aspects that are in the bill
 
01:23:32.699 --> 01:23:33.410 align:start position:0%
countless aspects that are in the bill
um

01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I think that it's fair to say
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
that 1137 should probably die a
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
respectful death and uh that
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
moving forward any legislation should
 
01:23:50.649 --> 01:23:50.659 align:start position:0%
consider existing statutes the Ed rules
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
and uh I would certainly be in support
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
of a study committee or
 
01:23:57.239 --> 01:23:58.850 align:start position:0%
of a study committee or
Commission

01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the duties of school board
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
members and whether or not they are
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
adequately defined
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
as is
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
um could we say
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
um there was uh
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh I won't speak for everyone but a
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
unanimous thought that it should not
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
move forward as is but there could be a
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
better definition in statute of the
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
duties of a school board in a
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
centralized location with respect to
 
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:36.140 align:start position:0%
other areas of the rsas
 
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
and that some members think that a a
 
01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:41.709 align:start position:0%
and that some members think that a a
study

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
committee uh Bill might be a solution
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'll speak for myself enjoy I could live
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
with that okay
 
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
okay good everyone can live with that
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
um and uh please when we're uh in a full
 
01:25:08.699 --> 01:25:09.890 align:start position:0%
um and uh please when we're uh in a full
committee

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
um if I misstate what I just stated uh
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
please correct me
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
do you need a motion on this
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um it would probably be a good idea
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right I move that uh we do not move
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
forward with House Bill 1137
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
and that any uh future recommendations
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
be brought to with the Full House and
 
01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:43.790 align:start position:0%
be brought to with the Full House and
committee

01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
um well it would
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
any future legislation
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
um would come to the Full House
 
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
committee anyway right but with regards
 
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
to the meeting on the 24th that we oh
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes right now Foundation fourth to the
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes right yeah okay
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
all right yeah
 
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
um everyone in representative Muppet
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
discussion yes you know real quick uh I
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
agree with what the chair just said I
 
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
agree mostly with what representative
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
Mullen just said I just want to in
 
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
addition to the notion of a commission
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
or committee or whatever I I do want to
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
just say that we have a filing period in
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
November those who might still be around
 
01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.550 align:start position:0%
November those who might still be around
and

01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um rather than have a which we could do
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
as well I have a commission or committee
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
whatever on the on the totality of
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
school board expectations but there are
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of pieces of this that many of us
 
01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:46.820 align:start position:0%
liked for example just one example
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
posting all curriculum and competencies
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
on the district website that largely
 
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
happens already doesn't happen
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
everywhere but if there were an LSR or
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
Bill that simply said something like
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that would be more
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh chewable what's the word I'm looking
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
for digestible then then then yeah
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
digestible than this so I just want to
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
make the point that
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
um the the many good pieces of this I
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
think uh some of them could come forward
 
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
and should come forward uh after
 
01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:22.669 align:start position:0%
and should come forward uh after
November

01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
November
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
in smaller chunks so to speak uh thank
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
Okay so are we we're all good with
 
01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.490 align:start position:0%
Okay so are we we're all good with
that

01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.020 align:start position:0%

1664.
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
requiring certain non-public schools or
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
education service providers that accept
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
public funds to perform background
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

this
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
legislation I think the prime sponsor
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
was uh representative Porter
 
01:33:06.719 --> 01:33:09.050 align:start position:0%
was uh representative Porter
um

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh did
 
01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
yes that's what I was going to ask okay
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for letting me speak to
 
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%

this Mr chair my concern was and Still
Remains

01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
Remains
 
01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:23.050 align:start position:0%
Remains
um

01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
the ability of Bad actors and there are
 
01:33:27.239 --> 01:33:28.129 align:start position:0%
the ability of Bad actors and there are
some

01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.139 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way
 
01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
lessons uh School rooms uh
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
prendapods that kind of stuff
 
01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
prendapods that kind of stuff
um

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
for not very good reasons
 
01:33:48.729 --> 01:33:48.739 align:start position:0%
um and we I know we spent a lot of time
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with what background checks have
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
to be done and what would would
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
constitute not allowing somebody to get
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
there their teacher credential but if I
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
understood correctly from the testimony
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
that we heard during the year that
 
01:34:09.239 --> 01:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
that we heard during the year that
foreign

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't have to be certified
 
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
to do a job
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education only does
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
those background checks on people who
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
are looking to get teacher credentials
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have any authority to do
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
background checks on other people
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
the only those that are getting a
 
01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:32.570 align:start position:0%
the only those that are getting a
credential

01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
credential
 
01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:33.649 align:start position:0%
credential
um

01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
I know that when I ran my preschool
 
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.970 align:start position:0%
I know that when I ran my preschool
kindergarten

01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.649 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
if

01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
a high school kid came down to work with
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
us which they often did and they were
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
over a certain age they had to have a
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
background check because they were
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
coming in okay I didn't take public
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
money when I was there
 
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
I'm just really this really worries me
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
um because I have heard some really bad
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
stories and not saying that there's
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
everybody but I know you read the papers
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it's
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's not just it's clergy it's Boy Scout
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
leaders it's Girl Scout leaders there
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
seems to be so many places where these
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
um people who want to get access to
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
young children infiltrate so that they
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
can do that and if we're going to be
 
01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
sending money from our tax base
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
to pay for services that someone is
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
providing in their home or in the
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
prendapod or you know after school
 
01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:34.139 align:start position:0%
program somewhere
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
they need to we need to make sure that
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
we're not allowing those kinds of people
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
to have access to our young people so I
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
know that there was an issue
 
01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.189 align:start position:0%
know that there was an issue
um

01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
and there were several other bills along
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
this line
 
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
there were problems with what kind of
 
01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.510 align:start position:0%
there were problems with what kind of
um

01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
background check could be done who could
 
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%
who had the authority to get the FBI one
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing
 
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
and that we were going to there was a
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
commission that was set up from
 
01:36:07.139 --> 01:36:08.709 align:start position:0%
commission that was set up from
um

01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire had set up that's
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
a little on this draft note like so I'm
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
really hoping that when when you
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
consider this bill that you consider
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
that this will be looked into next term
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
I recommend that something like this
 
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
will be investigated to assure me when
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
I'm home watching from from the video
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
um that I'm not going to be starting to
 
01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.330 align:start position:0%
um that I'm not going to be starting to
hear

01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
horror stories of young children being
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
abused because of not having nobody knew
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
that they were this or that that was
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with them so thank you
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative bone
 
01:36:51.649 --> 01:36:51.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyway the
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
problem with this is homeschool a group
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
of homeschool
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
students can get together and invite
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in to speak to them
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
people are there the parents are there
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to get
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
people to come in and speak if they have
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
to have a criminal background check and
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
the point is also on private schools
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
altogether I mean a lawsuit can put a
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
private school out of business there are
 
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
going to be more of a criminal
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
background check than public schools you
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
can't put a public school out of
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
business a private school you can
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools you can put out a
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
business and insurance companies won't
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
won't cover you unless you've done a
 
01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
criminal background check on Catholic
 
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
schools so this is even less than that
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
this is inviting somebody in to speak
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
about a different subject to your own
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
home school students so why do they need
 
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
to have a criminal background check
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get people to come
 
01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
in and discuss things so to me this goes
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
way overboard and as part of the do away
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay so one of the things that um
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
when we ran the preschool kindergarten
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
we had to get so many credit hours
 
01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:14.699 align:start position:0%
um of in-service training every year and
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
it created a problem when we were only
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
work had our school only open you know
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
so many hours a week and but the health
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
and human services department and their
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
rules specified that if someone was
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
working five hours or less with the
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
children in a week they didn't have to
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
go through that so it's you could have a
 
01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:39.179 align:start position:0%
bill that would say that somebody who's
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
working X number of times x number of
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
time with children as a volunteer
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to have the background
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
check okay so I think we could overcome
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
that representative and you know I don't
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
think this is against efas this is child
 
01:38:59.209 --> 01:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
protection I mean this is child
 
01:38:59.219 --> 01:39:00.649 align:start position:0%
protection I mean this is child
protection

01:39:00.649 --> 01:39:00.659 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
we have these rules for public schools
 
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
for child protection but if we don't
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
have these rules for other kinds of
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
schools in the state or other kinds of
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities we're
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
abandoning that and and it's
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's scary to me it's scary to me so I'm
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we could have some kind of
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
adaption adaptions made to make it
 
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
doable for someone who just comes in for
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
an hour or two or gives a lecture it
 
01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
comes in for a puppet show or that kind
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
of thing but if someone's working day in
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
day out in a small group of children
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
with a small group of children by
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
themselves I think they need to make we
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that that person is
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
safe to have her own children and if
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
we're sending the money to do it we need
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're safe around
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
children so it's not against EFA you
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
know it really isn't it's a it's a child
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
safety thing representative Tanner thank
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
you well after working and representing
 
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
Mullen knows this too after working in
 
01:40:07.610 --> 01:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
the background check realm it is
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
unbelievable but there are some things
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
that that um for example camps all camps
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to have all their counselors
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
background checked and camps can get
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
sued and put out of business too but
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
obviously it was put into statute so
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
that every Camp particularly does that
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I think is is uh
 
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
should be known in this whole realm is
 
01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:36.860 align:start position:0%
that the state actually tried to Define
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer when when would a volunteer
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
like someone coming into a home school
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
school or coming into a classroom have
 
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
to get a background check
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
and this the state at that time the
 
01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
safety issue was that if if someone came
 
01:40:59.090 --> 01:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
in on a volunteer basis for
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time but also that
 
01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:05.900 align:start position:0%
they had no time alone that with
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
students so the volunteer came in the
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
speaker came in and there were other
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
adults in the room as as representative
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
Baum has described then that person did
 
01:41:20.930 --> 01:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
not need a background check and that
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's already in in our statutes as a
 
01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
description of volunteers
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about and and just
 
01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:32.219 align:start position:0%
recently you know in my area where now
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
you can get PE credit you know mowing
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
Grandma's lawn or whatever but I'm sure
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
some of the people get PE credits uh for
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh being on soccer teams and doing
 
01:41:44.810 --> 01:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
soccer programs and we've just had a
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
report come out with
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh horrible news about
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
um how some of these private soccer
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
clubs that have been set up and that um
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
are particularly for young women and
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
girls how uh destructive they are and
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
how there's been quite a bit of abuse
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they're totally unregulated and one
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the things about public schools and
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
and even Charter Schools is that
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
um you've got a system of oversight and
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
assessment you've got
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
um you know you never nothing is going
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
99.9 sure we know that if a background
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
check is done today
 
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
tomorrow who knows what that person
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
might do what we're trying to do is do
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
the best we can to provide safety for
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
students on a regular basis whether it's
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
the bus driver
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
cafeteria worker uh the volunteer that
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
comes in that actually spends one to one
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
time on unsupervised time with students
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
those people need to have background
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
checks so that we have some sort of
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
issue about it and I think that saying
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
that well you know parents are parents
 
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
are the oversight parents are the
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
assessment of uh when the student does
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
prender when they uh go on the soccer
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
team or they you know whatever these
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
other places that they can get their
 
01:43:12.119 --> 01:43:13.669 align:start position:0%
other places that they can get their
education

01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine and good but parents
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to nor the ability
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
to do background checks it's kind of
 
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
like when I go in to buy meat at the
 
01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:23.890 align:start position:0%
like when I go in to buy meat at the
store

01:43:23.890 --> 01:43:23.900 align:start position:0%
store
 
01:43:27.129 --> 01:43:27.139 align:start position:0%
I assume that meat is going to be safe
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
it's been tested the there's reg there's
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
government regulations on it that I'm
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
not immediately exposed to you know some
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
sort of poisonous
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
um meat uh rotten meat or something
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
inside it
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and when it does happen and it does
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
happen once in a while
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
there's government reporting that
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
catches it and then
 
01:43:53.689 --> 01:43:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh you know finds out about it we know
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
that for example St Paul's had a
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
horrible situation going on and that
 
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
um you know I and I'm sure their
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
background checks are like Stellar now
 
01:44:05.209 --> 01:44:05.219 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
we need to have some sort of checks and
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
balances and we need to keep Kids Safe
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
And there are Bad actors out there that
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
are that see an opportunity and and I
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll comment at this point
 
01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:33.860 align:start position:0%
um I am uh
 
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
troubled by the uh home education
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
um Provisions
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
um in this bill
 
01:44:43.129 --> 01:44:43.139 align:start position:0%
um as referenced by representative boehm
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted as requiring a
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
background check to educate your own
 
01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.370 align:start position:0%
background check to educate your own
children

01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
um there are uh very many
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
home education cooperatives where
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
families get together and
 
01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
um you know children go to a cooperative
 
01:45:08.169 --> 01:45:08.179 align:start position:0%
for lessons on various subjects
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
schools now micro schools doing that
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
same thing that that Do Do by background
 
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
checks so I think we're going in a very
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
bad Direction
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
um to include that in any language
 
01:45:24.490 --> 01:45:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony from Diana Fenton
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
when we first heard this bill about the
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing efforts of the Department of
 
01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.430 align:start position:0%
ongoing efforts of the Department of
Education

01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
with relation to background checks and
 
01:45:37.689 --> 01:45:37.699 align:start position:0%
they're ongoing
 
01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:41.699 align:start position:0%
efforts to expand and Define that with
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm also troubled by us getting involved
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
with non-public schools
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
I do have an email that I received um
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
last year I think after after we heard
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
this bill from the superintendent of
 
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools David T ball
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and in his email to me he said I
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
can't speak for all non-public schools
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
but our Catholic schools have to conduct
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
background checks for all Personnel
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
coaches and volunteers
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
we have to do this for our safe
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
environment protocols
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
and ministerial conduct policies
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
first and foremost also insurance
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
companies do require it and yes schools
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
who are accredited have to meet
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
standards for these checks as well
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
trying to include non-public schools in
 
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.530 align:start position:0%
trying to include non-public schools in
um

01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
provision and statute here for this
 
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
um is wrong I think that it's already
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
being done
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think that the government
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
needs to put its hand into uh every pie
 
01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
out there in terms of private soccer
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
clubs I don't know if that is something
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we want to get involved in here I
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
know my kids played little league and
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
had figure skating coaches and you know
 
01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
that was our responsibility as parents
 
01:47:36.010 --> 01:47:36.020 align:start position:0%
we didn't require
 
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:39.179 align:start position:0%
the little league coach to have a
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
background check before we allowed our
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
kid to play
 
01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
Little League Baseball
 
01:47:49.330 --> 01:47:49.340 align:start position:0%
so I think that this
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislation goes beyond where we should
 
01:47:54.129 --> 01:47:54.139 align:start position:0%
be going
 
01:47:54.139 --> 01:47:55.689 align:start position:0%
be going
but

01:47:55.689 --> 01:47:55.699 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
that we all are concerned with safe 50
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
of children and I think that that is a
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility in terms of our public
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
and public charter schools but that it's
 
01:48:13.209 --> 01:48:13.219 align:start position:0%
already being done for
 
01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:15.550 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:16.729 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
[Music]

01:48:16.729 --> 01:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
representative Porter thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
um first of all the soccer clubs aren't
 
01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
getting our tax dollars okay second and
 
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm this is one of the reasons why this
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
is so concerning to me
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
we hear all the time about the nice
 
01:48:34.609 --> 01:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
things that go on home schools and I
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
have worked with excellent homeschool
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
students when I worked for the Youth
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
advisory Council I am not against it but
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
in my town
 
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
we had a situation
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
where the children were removed from
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
school brought to homeschool
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
and were being sexually abused by their
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
stepfather and because there was no way
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
that the school could check on them and
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
there was no protection for those girls
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
those girls suffered and finally one of
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
them escaped she ran away to the
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors the neighbors helped her to
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
get away and she went to Florida
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
and she filed a suit against her father
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
and stepfather and she ended up he ends
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
he is in jail now
 
01:49:26.050 --> 01:49:26.060 align:start position:0%
so that makes me really concerned about
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
what happens to children when there's no
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
one checking on them when they're with a
 
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
bad actor
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
I I can't imagine the life that that
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
family of young girls was living
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
but it couldn't have been very good it's
 
01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
no one there for them there was no one
 
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
to protect them that little girl at 14
 
01:49:47.209 --> 01:49:47.219 align:start position:0%
had to run away to a neighbor to get the
 
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
help that she needed
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
to escape that situation I don't want
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing to happen to our
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
young people and if we're we're able to
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
say that the private schools are already
 
01:50:03.169 --> 01:50:03.179 align:start position:0%
doing background checks fantastic then
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
then if this bill won't be an issue for
 
01:50:06.119 --> 01:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
then if this bill won't be an issue for
them

01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:50:11.090 --> 01:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
but these other opportunities need to be
 
01:50:15.609 --> 01:50:15.619 align:start position:0%
addressed they can't be ignored
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
I just I feel very strongly about it and
 
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
Miss representative Bowman doesn't have
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
anything to do with efas it's got to do
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
with what happened to those little girls
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
in my town they live down the road from
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
me I didn't know what was going on
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lakers
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
seems to me that was a family issue
 
01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:37.550 align:start position:0%
seems to me that was a family issue
and

01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
number one would background check done
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
on the father or stepfather rather have
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
turned up anything and number two are we
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
going to background check every single
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
parent because that yes they came out of
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
the school but that was in their home
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
that that was happening and if you want
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
to stop that a you're going to have to
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
background check every parent because it
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
happens in homes all over the place they
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
say one in four
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
girls has been sexually abused by a
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
family member
 
01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.189 align:start position:0%
family member
okay

01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't see how doing background
 
01:51:20.689 --> 01:51:20.699 align:start position:0%
checks is going to stop that and number
 
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
two these things do happen in public
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
schools too
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
they definitely do I mean I know lots of
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
examples including my granddaughter's
 
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
best friend
 
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
so the background checks I don't see
 
01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:38.219 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
something a miracle to help something
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to help you it
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're I mean yes you want
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
to help them I want to help them I want
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
to protect all those kids and get abused
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
by their parents
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
or step parents or parents boyfriends or
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
girlfriends or whatever
 
01:51:56.699 --> 01:51:58.550 align:start position:0%
girlfriends or whatever
uncles

01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
uncles
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
but background checks doesn't seem to do
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
it none of those people fail background
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
checks I bet you that I mean I'm I would
 
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:09.260 align:start position:0%
be willing to bet that that
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
father-in-law did not fail or would not
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
fail a background check and because it's
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
happening in homes I don't know how
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to stop that by doing
 
01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:23.179 align:start position:0%
background checks on
 
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
parents and a number of these things
 
01:52:27.649 --> 01:52:27.659 align:start position:0%
that are in here that we want them on
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
are places where parents are present are
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye and and I think they're
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually less likely to have problems
 
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:39.659 align:start position:0%
than the public schools where we're not
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
thank you again the bill can be adjusted
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
up and down to change things the main
 
01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
idea here is we need to make sure that
 
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
people who are working with children are
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
safe to work with children so however
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
you want to hate this bill or be angry
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
at me because I filed it because you
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
think it's against efas that's not the
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
issue the issue is we need to make sure
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
we do something to protect children
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
while working with adults we need to
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that the Bad actors do not
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
get access through programs that don't
 
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
require that they be checked before they
 
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
work with children so I hope that you
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
will understand the point of view I hope
 
01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
that someone will file a bill next term
 
01:53:33.169 --> 01:53:33.179 align:start position:0%
that will make sure that anybody that
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
works in small groups with children
 
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
without another adult for more than so
 
01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:38.699 align:start position:0%
many hours a week
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
has a background check before they are
 
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
paid by the State dollars and that thank
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
you very much for listening
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
remember someone representative cordelli
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
I swore I was not going to speak on this
 
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
bill but I am a co-sponsor of the bill
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
so uh hence my seat at the table I
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
am I have a question just I I am trying
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
to figure out why private schools who
 
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
are already doing a background check
 
01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
would have trouble
 
01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
or have a problem with a statute that
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
says that they have to conduct a
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
background check it doesn't seem to me
 
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like it would be an a a
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
wash on if they're already doing it and
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
it becomes part of the statute I'm not
 
01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
sure why that would be a problem whether
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's a Catholic school or Dairy Field
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
school or whomever it happens to be in
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the private school aspect
 
01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:35.870 align:start position:0%
terms of the private school aspect
um

01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
second of all
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
um I yeah I
 
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
think that we're we're
 
01:54:44.689 --> 01:54:44.699 align:start position:0%
getting off track when we talk about
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
somebody having to
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
some parent having to have a background
 
01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:50.699 align:start position:0%
check to
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
homeschool their own child I mean I I
 
01:54:55.609 --> 01:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
that that would not be something that
 
01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
that would have been on my list of
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
highlights what would have been on my
 
01:55:03.649 --> 01:55:03.659 align:start position:0%
list of highlights is the concept of the
 
01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:06.179 align:start position:0%
micro school or the micro
 
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
program or whatever where somebody's
 
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
being dropped off at the library because
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to be one of four kids
 
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
that is studying with somebody that
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
nobody knows and nobody's mother's in
 
01:55:21.709 --> 01:55:21.719 align:start position:0%
the room that's the scenario that I am
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
most concerned about so if if we were
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
able to find a way just to Target those
 
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
in public schools we call them
 
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
designated volunteers and they have to
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
have a background check because they're
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
designated to be with kids alone if
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
there was a way that we could just cover
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
that cohort
 
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.169 align:start position:0%
that cohort
um

01:55:45.169 --> 01:55:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tanner
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I totally agree with representative
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
Mullen and as I pointed out before there
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
is a statute about volunteers that that
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
tries to Define it and says that if they
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
are spending a significant amount of
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
time alone with with children I also
 
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
think that a few years
 
01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
well I also think that education where
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
what we're overseeing and has
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
traditionally been one of the safety
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
nets for students safety nets for food
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
insecurity safety net for homeless and
 
01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
safety net for abuse and that that covid
 
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
really wrecked a lot of that that was
 
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
you know that's the harmony Montgomery
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
one where you have a child who all of a
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
sudden is schooled and then under covet
 
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:42.179 align:start position:0%
just is missing and not not
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
taken into account or anything so I
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
think that um what we're looking at is
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
trying to provide some sort of safety
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
net that's connected with education
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
where if somebody is spending time alone
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
with a student either online micro
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
School uh
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
Public School volunteer coach I and I
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
would I would kind of think that little
 
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:09.659 align:start position:0%
league as an organization probably has
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
some standards on background checks for
 
01:57:16.490 --> 01:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
for those people as well as Camp Stu I
 
01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
mean again I'll I'll bring it back that
 
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
even camps in New Hampshire have to have
 
01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
all their counselors background checked
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
in order uh to run the camp legitimate
 
01:57:28.430 --> 01:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know to get this certification from
 
01:57:32.689 --> 01:57:32.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I don't think this is
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
pie in the sky I think obviously I think
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
you're right representative electus
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're never going to totally rule out
 
01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
abuse at home
 
01:57:43.609 --> 01:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
um we can't uh the government's not
 
01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
going into people's houses and you know
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
doing background checks that's not what
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about what we're talking
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
about is people that are working with
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
students under the guise of Education
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
under the guise of Public Funding that
 
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
are spending time alone with students
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
either online or individ in a school of
 
01:58:06.410 --> 01:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
some type that they should they should
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
fall under the background check rule
 
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
would represent bone can I ask a
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
question so uh in this in a case of uh
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
micro educational situation or whatever
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
who would be responsible if um I mean
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
you know obviously if if a teacher at
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
school or a volunteer at school does
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
something that they're not supposed to
 
01:58:28.609 --> 01:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
it's the school district that's
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately responsible who would be
 
01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
responsible if do parents sign a waiver
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
on child safety I mean how does how does
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.239 --> 01:58:42.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I I think most of the conversation
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
about micro schools
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
is pointed toward pranda learning pods
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
and there are two flavors
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
um one flavor is a district pod where
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
the district sets up the learning pod
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
with prenda and or in charge of
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
everything and hire the teacher
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um or The Apprentice guide Etc the other
 
01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
is a community pod
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
um where parents get together and work
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
with prenda and
 
01:59:21.649 --> 01:59:21.659 align:start position:0%
um have their choice of prenda guides to
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
hire uh Brenda is under contract to the
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education
 
01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh prenda does background checks on
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
employment background checks on all
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
their guides as part of their hiring
 
01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:41.149 align:start position:0%
their guides as part of their hiring
process

01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and let me also mention that
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm very disturbed about any
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
indication that uh someone might be
 
01:59:55.609 --> 01:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
homeschooling in order to keep their
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
kids at home
 
02:00:02.089 --> 02:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
um to cover up or uh prolong abuse of
 
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
that child
 
02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:04.550 align:start position:0%
that child
um

02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
as a member of the home education
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
advisory Council I am very concerned
 
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:15.260 align:start position:0%
about any indications
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
ruptured bone I think you had in your
 
02:00:26.089 --> 02:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
hand up thank you yeah just remember
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
this is an interim study no matter what
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
we say here
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
you can still put in the bill
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
now I think this bill goes too far and
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
some things on maybe somebody can come
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
up with language but interim study I
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
mean it's a nice way of killing a bill
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is we've anybody
 
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
can put in the bill next year no matter
 
02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
what we say and we don't know who's
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to be on the education committee
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
next year maybe none of us here so it's
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
all going to be new information one way
 
02:01:00.169 --> 02:01:00.179 align:start position:0%
or another so also I was also on a home
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
education advisory counseled some 10
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
years ago anyway and that time we asked
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
that question have there been to the doe
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
at the time have we had any cases for
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
home education due to abuse and I think
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
it was five years even before that they
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
had one case from Manchester out of all
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
the thousands of kids in a home school
 
02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not an issue it's no big of
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
an issue than any place else so I don't
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
believe homeschool kids I don't know of
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
any cases I haven't heard of any cases
 
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill goes way too far of
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
what's needed thank you representative
 
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
cordelli so back to my question about I
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
was doing everything I could not to use
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
the word pranda because I didn't want to
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
Target anybody as uh the micro school
 
02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
um if the State Department of Education
 
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
hires them
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
and prenda has already done a background
 
02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:03.659 align:start position:0%
check then I don't understand why they
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't feel that they were complying
 
02:02:09.649 --> 02:02:09.659 align:start position:0%
with a statute that said that they had
 
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
to have a background check so I
 
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
I well I I would say I I don't know if
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
we want to put in
 
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
um statute any particular organization
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
that might
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
um have a contract oh no no no no that
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
was my point that's why I was saying
 
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
micro schools or whatever uh
 
02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:32.750 align:start position:0%
micro schools or whatever uh
right

02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:33.890 align:start position:0%
right
um

02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:35.689 --> 02:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
yes representative and I just I just
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
want to I I know you emphasized that it
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
was Employee background checks this is
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
the other complexity that that
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen and I and Diana
 
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
Fenton and whoever worked on these
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
background checks is that there's
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
different levels of background checks
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
and that for people who spend time alone
 
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
with children
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
um in educational settings there's a
 
02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:58.490 align:start position:0%
um in educational settings there's a
specific

02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:03:00.169 --> 02:03:00.179 align:start position:0%
background check
 
02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
list of what has to pop up versus
 
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who takes a job at Grove Pony
 
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
Ford for example they do an employment
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
background check uh they're more
 
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
concerned about arson about you know
 
02:03:19.129 --> 02:03:19.139 align:start position:0%
robbery assault that kind of things they
 
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
they really don't get down into some of
 
02:03:23.209 --> 02:03:23.219 align:start position:0%
the weeds that the educational
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
background checks do so just so there's
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
two level there's more than two levels
 
02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:28.790 align:start position:0%
two level there's more than two levels
but

02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
um just want to point that out
 
02:03:34.129 --> 02:03:34.139 align:start position:0%
reverse reporter so before I get
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
attacked again as a
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
um saying that I am against
 
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
homeschooling I am not against
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
homeschooling nor do I think
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
nor nor do I agree with the implication
 
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
that you uh said representative that I
 
02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.490 align:start position:0%
that you uh said representative that I
thought

02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
thought
 
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
it does happen and we don't have anybody
 
02:03:54.119 --> 02:03:55.250 align:start position:0%
it does happen and we don't have anybody
now

02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
who goes and visits the home schools all
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
of that regulation is gone so it can
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
happen and to hide our heads in the sand
 
02:04:08.089 --> 02:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
saying it only happens a few times is
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
not to me enough I can but I agree that
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
the bill goes too far to say parents and
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
I didn't intend for parents to be the
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
ones that had all had background checks
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
but if someone comes in
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
and works with a group of children alone
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
without another adult there for certain
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
periods of time over the course of a
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
week we need to make sure that they are
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
safe for children so you can
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
do whatever you want with the bill I
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't really care at this point
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
but I am you know I mean this is
 
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:04:53.450 --> 02:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
but okay
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I think representative Cornell is not
 
02:04:58.810 --> 02:04:58.820 align:start position:0%
on there it's not me no no
 
02:05:02.810 --> 02:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
on the committee that were appointed yep
 
02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
and if there's a substitute they have to
 
02:05:08.689 --> 02:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
be appointed by the chair and I have
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
appointed no substitute right right so
 
02:05:15.070 --> 02:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
we had cordelli
 
02:05:18.890 --> 02:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
and quarter of 10.
 
02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:24.910 align:start position:0%
and quarter of 10.
okay

02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's four right there so Wireless
 
02:05:30.649 --> 02:05:30.659 align:start position:0%
quarters candidates 3 by 57 on this one
 
02:05:30.659 --> 02:05:32.089 align:start position:0%
quarters candidates 3 by 57 on this one
okay

02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:32.099 --> 02:05:34.149 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:38.089 --> 02:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
any yes I just have one more question if
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
you don't mind
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
um is there anything that prevents a
 
02:05:45.609 --> 02:05:45.619 align:start position:0%
school district in a home school town
 
02:05:49.729 --> 02:05:49.739 align:start position:0%
from calling the parent who might be
 
02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and checking in and saying
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
is that allowed or
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know I don't think there's
 
02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
anything uh in statute about uh
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
preventing it but um I I think that uh
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
um homeschoolers might uh get a little
 
02:06:16.129 --> 02:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
upset to have the school district just
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
calling up and asking uh how you doing
 
02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh is everything okay
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
I think that might be a a stretch
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
the superintendent school
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's responsibility to know how all
 
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
children in that District receive their
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.460 --> 02:08:09.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
um I too think that homeschooling you
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
know has its purpose and has its has its
 
02:08:17.209 --> 02:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
place what I question is when you said
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the superintendent is responsible for
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
the education of all children within the
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
district I was at a recent school board
 
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
meeting and and somebody either I can't
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
remember if it was on the board or
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
somebody in the audience asked the
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
superintendent how many school how many
 
02:08:34.609 --> 02:08:34.619 align:start position:0%
students in his district
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
were homeschooled and he said really I
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
have no idea because they just have to
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
check in at the very beginning of their
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and then I don't know if
 
02:08:45.770 --> 02:08:45.780 align:start position:0%
they move I don't know where they are so
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
he had no
 
02:08:50.209 --> 02:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
he couldn't even come up with a number
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
he had a rough number but he couldn't
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think under the
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
um legislation we passed last year
 
02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and possibly before if
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
um now if you do move
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
um you're supposed and you would um
 
02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:20.870 align:start position:0%
um you're supposed and you would um
originally

02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
originally
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
um filed your intent with the local
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent you're supposed to let
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
that person know
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
um that you are yeah right yeah
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
how would you enforce it if if the the
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
family says we're homeschooling our
 
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
children and and at the end of the year
 
02:09:45.530 --> 02:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to say okay you know
 
02:09:49.370 --> 02:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
we're done or we're moving but they move
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
and they don't tell anybody and that's
 
02:09:54.649 --> 02:09:54.659 align:start position:0%
against the law but how do you enforce
 
02:09:57.070 --> 02:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
that because they've moved to Florida
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
and they don't register that they're
 
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
homeschooling or they don't register
 
02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
them in a public school or any kind of
 
02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
school so those children have just
 
02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
school so those children have just
disappeared

02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 
02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
can't enforce them
 
02:10:12.430 --> 02:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
right um
 
02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:14.540 align:start position:0%
how many people
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
moved to Florida and neglect to tell the
 
02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
Board of Elections that they're moving
 
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
and uh not deregister from voting here
 
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but it's a problem even
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
though with public school students
 
02:10:32.089 --> 02:10:32.099 align:start position:0%
because as my previous Life as a
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor students wouldn't
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
show up at the beginning of the year and
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
would look for them and the neighbors
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
would say oh they've moved to Florida we
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
never got a request for records nobody
 
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
ever heard from them again so they
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
disappeared so we never found out what
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
was happening with those kids
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:10.729 --> 02:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
yes but these are students that are
 
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
registered in schools that after that
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
disappear they're already registered and
 
02:11:18.970 --> 02:11:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if that relates
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
um we've had
 
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of discussion on uh 1664
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Bohm I like to make a
 
02:11:43.609 --> 02:11:43.619 align:start position:0%
motion that we
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
not recommend this bill for moving
 
02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.089 align:start position:0%
not recommend this bill for moving
forward

02:11:50.089 --> 02:11:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:01.790 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:06.050 --> 02:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
um just any yeah just further discussion
 
02:12:09.169 --> 02:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
representative I mean like I said before
 
02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
interim study actually really means
 
02:12:13.970 --> 02:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
nothing you can put the build in again
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
you can put a bill in differently and
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm and and some other recommendation I
 
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
mean thing on this bill which makes it
 
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
makes it clearer or less I might even
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
like but this bill goes way too far and
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's why but
 
02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's way it's way overboard thank you
 
02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:39.050 align:start position:0%
it's way it's way overboard thank you
option

02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative Porter yeah you know the
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
only and I agree with you
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
with your polite death but when we say
 
02:12:49.129 --> 02:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
that the bill itself we didn't like but
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
we do recommend
 
02:12:53.330 --> 02:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
future legislation because the concept
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
itself is important
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the difference to me between
 
02:13:00.169 --> 02:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
just saying I don't think we should have
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
a bill on this or I do think eventually
 
02:13:05.089 --> 02:13:05.099 align:start position:0%
we should have a bill on this that's how
 
02:13:07.609 --> 02:13:07.619 align:start position:0%
my I interpret it
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
and this still takes another vote by the
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
whole committee and that can be brought
 
02:13:15.890 --> 02:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
is that if you're looking for why I'm
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to do not support this bill moving
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
forward I just tried to write some
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
things down here learning pods are
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
allowed under New Hampshire law
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
and consistent with existing home
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
education law
 
02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
to have family members friends or
 
02:13:38.450 --> 02:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
someone else supervised children I'm
 
02:13:41.410 --> 02:13:41.420 align:start position:0%
concerned by doing what we're doing here
 
02:13:45.069 --> 02:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
we're really going to be impacting
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
homeschooling education in the state
 
02:13:49.010 --> 02:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
where we have many students being
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
homeschooled in in a way that there's
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
consequences which haven't been thought
 
02:13:57.530 --> 02:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
of here in this committee so I I cannot
 
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
support it moving forward as as is right
 
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:04.010 align:start position:0%
support it moving forward as as is right
now

02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.450 --> 02:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
um shall we representative Lakers
 
02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:08.569 align:start position:0%
um shall we representative Lakers
comment

02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
actually a question do we require
 
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
background checks for babysitters
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
because they're also spending time and
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
they could be the high school kid and I
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
I just I I think representative Porter
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
would say that they're not accepting
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
public funds
 
02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
public funds
okay

02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.050 --> 02:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay shall we take a a vote
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
um all those who agree with the motion
 
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
of not moving forward with this
 
02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:41.569 align:start position:0%
of not moving forward with this
legislation

02:14:41.569 --> 02:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.290 --> 02:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
and those opposed to the motion
 
02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:50.099 align:start position:0%
four to two I see
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
great well thank you very very much and
 
02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
I think the full committee meets on the
 
02:14:59.810 --> 02:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
24th is it for our final determination
 
02:15:02.530 --> 02:15:02.540 align:start position:0%
on all the enorm study bills
 
02:15:11.649 --> 02:15:11.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh tomorrow I have excuse me I didn't
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
mean to
 
02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:18.500 align:start position:0%
mean to
you
