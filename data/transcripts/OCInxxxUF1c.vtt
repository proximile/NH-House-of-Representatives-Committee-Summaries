00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
folks we'll just get underway in just a
 
00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 align:start position:0%
moment we have about a minute or so
 
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
a work session
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
soon as it's 1001 i'm going to open the
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
work session on
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 367.
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's now open and i will open the floor
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
for further discussion on the
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
as we had heard over the last um several
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
sessions we have been doing diligent
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
work to sort of clarify language around
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
the concept i'm going to take this off
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
for a moment
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
around the concept and
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
we did still have some underlying
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
questions i do myself regarding
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
potential emissions that exist with
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
fuels although they may not be
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
considered for potentially for
 
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
considered for potentially for
sale

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
as a but there may be an instance in
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
which fuels are used within the plants
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
and with that there are certain
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
chemicals that potentially are emitted
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
do think we have
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
the need for a little bit further
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
clarity on that
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and as well as again sort of with
 
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.189 align:start position:0%
um and as well as again sort of with
um

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
sourcing of the feedstock and where
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
those feedstocks come from so with that
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'll open the floor for further
 
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.390 align:start position:0%
i'll open the floor for further
discussion

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%

representative contoir
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just a quick
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
question and we discussed
 
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.070 align:start position:0%
question and we discussed
how

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know the energy uses for
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
these plants and
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
it was said that it would probably be
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
through natural gas but i'm wondering
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
how much natural gas
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
would these plants be using
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is jody grimbulus
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i am representing the american
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
chemistry council unfortunately i
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that information because i
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
do not know at this point what size a
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
plant might be um so obviously its
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
energy needs will be based on the size
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
and capacity of that plant um
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
i apologize it would it depends on what
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
would be coming in okay um do you know
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
what the energy use decision is in the
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
other plants that are uh in other states
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
if they're using uh natural gas i can
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:49.909 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
um

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
not so much a question but uh i have no
 
00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.309 align:start position:0%
not so much a question but uh i have no
problem

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
with uh the conversion of these plastics
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
into fuel
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
the bill excludes the marketing
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
of fuels
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
but to be used for the process
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm referring to page four
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
line 20
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the reporting and the
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
mass of processed material used for fuel
 
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.230 align:start position:0%
mass of processed material used for fuel
etc

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
as one of the components of reporting it
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
goes to the department
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
just a moment are you speaking about
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
potentially other language that might be
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
out there for consideration
 
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.790 align:start position:0%
out there for consideration
uh

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
this that's that's in my amendment i see
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we're catching the amendment we
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
hadn't really fully gotten to that that
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
point but i'm happy to open the floor to
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
that discussion if representative bixby
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
wants to speak to what's before us yeah
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
i i think it makes sense for me to just
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
go through uh what the amendment does
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm i will i will come circle
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
back to that but i think it just makes
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
sense to go through in in order
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh to point out what what's happening in
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment so
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.150 align:start position:0%
uh in
uh

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
section one uh the legislative purpose
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
and findings which by the way is not
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
legally binding it is just sort of
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
giving an introduction to what the bill
 
00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:13.270 align:start position:0%
giving an introduction to what the bill
does

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.150 align:start position:0%
does
uh

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.029 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
the the state the purpose the statement
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
of purpose uh first of all says this is
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
a nice thing which is you know kind of
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
advertising for the bill but more
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
importantly it points out that
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
plants that are
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
regulated under this
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
new statute this new set of statutes
 
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.110 align:start position:0%
new statute this new set of statutes
would

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
all manufacturing stat statutes and
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
rules that exist both in the state of
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and federally
 
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.670 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and federally
and

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
we do have already have fairly extensive
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
state statutes that deal with
 
00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:56.790 align:start position:0%
state statutes that deal with
with

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
emissions and
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
effluents at
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
solid waste hazardous waste etc and
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
those are also
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's also encompassed by a number of
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
elements of the um epa rules on air
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
emissions water emissions hazardous
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
weights etc so uh this the
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose statement just sort of
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies that
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh that those will be in effect for this
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
for anybody who
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
wants to build one of these plants in in
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
so under the definition of advanced
 
00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:32.310 align:start position:0%
so under the definition of advanced
recycling

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.710 align:start position:0%
recycling
the

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
the key things here are that uh it
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
indicates that advanced recycling
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
converted it basically does a chemical
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
conversion of
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
plastic feedstocks into uh usable
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
either raw materials and you
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
sort of further through the process
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
those raw materials would end up as a
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
combination of new plastics lubricants
 
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.829 align:start position:0%
combination of new plastics lubricants
coatings

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
coatings
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
it also uh says specifically that
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
the products of advanced recycling shall
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
not include hydrocarbons
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
which are marketed sold or used as fuel
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
for energy
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
now when it says the products of
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling the products indicate
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
what counts as having been recycled
 
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
what counts as having been recycled
so

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh it is within the realm of possibility
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
that a uh a factory would reuse some of
 
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.470 align:start position:0%
that a uh a factory would reuse some of
the

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
stuff that comes through the pyrolysis
 
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.910 align:start position:0%
stuff that comes through the pyrolysis
process

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
as fuel to heat their pyro on their
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis reactor
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
and but
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to count you that
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
fuel use as recycling it would just it
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
would be essentially a
 
00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.269 align:start position:0%
would be essentially a
uh

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.550 align:start position:0%
part of the
[Music]

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh amount of material that came in that
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
did not qualify as having been recycled
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh and in any recycling process there is
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
always going to be some degree of waste
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
this would uh not strictly be waste but
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
it would essentially be in the same
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
fraction of non-qualified uh
 
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.550 align:start position:0%
fraction of non-qualified uh
uh

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
elements that uh would um
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
as waste so um and then that gets
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
clarified as as representative stapleton
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
noted towards the end of the bill
 
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
noted towards the end of the bill
so

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
the advanced recycling facility is
 
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
the advanced recycling facility is
essentially

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:38.290 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.269 align:start position:0%
essentially
[Music]

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as it was in the
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
senate uh version
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh definition of um
 
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.190 align:start position:0%
uh definition of um
certified

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
certified waste derived product is
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as it was in the
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
senate version of the
 
00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.550 align:start position:0%
senate version of the
um

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
solid waste interchange a
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
depolymerization is uh
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
clarified to basically indicate that
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh the products of depolymerization are
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
essentially raw raw materials and
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
chemicals that could be used but
 
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.069 align:start position:0%
chemicals that could be used but
for

00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
further use but the actual process
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
yields raw materials
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
gasification is similarly uh clarified
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
it what gasification yields is raw
 
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.750 align:start position:0%
it what gasification yields is raw
materials

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.710 align:start position:0%
materials
and

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
post-use polymer
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
modified slightly uh
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things i realized in terms of
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
the way that post-use polymer was
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
used in the uh in the senate version
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
would have meant that uh
 
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.069 align:start position:0%
would have meant that uh
the

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh any any post you any post use polymer
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
like you know number one and two bottles
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh that ended up in mechanical recycling
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
would be excluded from the definition of
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
post-use polymer but in fact those
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
things really are post-use polymers so
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have something in
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
statute that's getting in the way of
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
existing mechanical recycling so um i uh
 
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.710 align:start position:0%
existing mechanical recycling so um i uh
so

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
the the that's the the main it's the
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
main thing i i did was i added that uh
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
it would be it could be used as feed
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
sock for either mechanical or chemical
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
recycling uh in terms of it not being
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
mixed with solid or hazardous waste uh
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
the senate version said on site or in
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
process but uh because
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh we're
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh of there's a um another step added
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
that i'll get to in a little in a couple
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
minutes um
 
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
minutes um
the

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
by the time the post-use polymer gets to
 
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.509 align:start position:0%
by the time the post-use polymer gets to
the

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
recycling facility it should by
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
solid waste or hazardous waste so
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh and having a definition of post-use
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
polymer that doesn't include the on-site
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
part is important because we have the
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
aggregators who are that who are
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
producing that they need to be able to
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
produce it before it's on site
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the next section is the post use
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
post used polymer aggregator which is
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
a new addition which is response to some
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
of the information we got last week and
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
this is a facility that collects sorts
 
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.350 align:start position:0%
this is a facility that collects sorts
cleans

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
cleans
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
plastic waste suitable for advanced
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
recycling and provides the feedstock to
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
mechanical or advanced recycling
 
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.829 align:start position:0%
mechanical or advanced recycling
facilities

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
so this could be
 
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.949 align:start position:0%
so this could be
and

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh that feedstock needs to meet the the
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
definition of post-use polymer and
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm saying the department should make
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
rules about how exactly this is managed
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh one thing that i
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
see as a shortcoming of this whole
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is i haven't had a chance to
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
check back with
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
des to make sure that i've gotten the
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
language that's giving them their orders
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
correct so uh
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that and that's something that could
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
probably be dealt with in a floor
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
amendment if i managed to get to talk to
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
them this week
 
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.509 align:start position:0%
them this week
uh

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
so uh
what

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of what a post-use polymer
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
aggregator does it could could be or
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
does basically right now northeast
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
resource recovery um
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
does uh collects plastics for
 
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.590 align:start position:0%
does uh collects plastics for
um

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
for mechanical recycling and ships them
 
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.389 align:start position:0%
for mechanical recycling and ships them
to

00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
wherever you know there's a market for
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
them and gets the best price they can
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
they could be they could qualify as one
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
of these post-use polymer aggregators
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
and they could uh also collect plastics
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
a wider range of of types of plastics
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
and provide them to advance recycling
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
and provide them to advance recycling
facilities

00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
the other is something like hannaford
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh where they bundle up a lot of their
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
film the filmly plastic and send that
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
down to the trex plant in
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
north carolina
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
they could uh get a permit from the des
 
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.269 align:start position:0%
they could uh get a permit from the des
and

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
then provide that filmy plastic to
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
to an advanced recycler in new hampshire
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
if there were one
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:25.350 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
i

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
i did um so on line 32 of that
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
potentially suggested language on page
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
two so it seems to me that there is a
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
wide range of facilities that could then
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
be considered these post-use aggregators
 
00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.230 align:start position:0%
be considered these post-use aggregators
has

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
have a and you're naming potentially
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
grocers to
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
an independent
 
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.949 align:start position:0%
an independent
nonprofit

00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
to many other facilities i guess my
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.110 align:start position:0%
question is
um

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
does that require some sort of
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
dual um
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
if you're having a grocer then be
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
considered an aggregator is there some
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
conflict with that or
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
i guess that's what i'm asking no uh
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
they should uh permits can be issued to
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
any um
 
00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.029 align:start position:0%
any um
to

00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
to any um
 
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.390 align:start position:0%
to any um
operation

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
to to so basically this is just another
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
permit that des would oversee
 
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.069 align:start position:0%
permit that des would oversee
and

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh there are many you know a lot most
 
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.549 align:start position:0%
uh there are many you know a lot most
companies

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.510 align:start position:0%
companies
have

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
multiple permits that they are required
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
to have to that that oversee what the
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
various sorts of things they do
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative uh
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
bixby um
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
when you talk about hannaford's
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
becoming a
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
post-use aggregator now would they have
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
to follow be under uh the solid waste
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
division because the aggregators have to
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
be registered with the department of
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
environmental services so would this be
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
something else that hannaford would have
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes the anybody anybody who wanted to uh
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
sell directly to a recycling facility
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
would have to uh get this permit if
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to sell to a
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
if someone were to sell to an aggregator
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
so if hannaford didn't want to deal with
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
this themselves they could sell their
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
stuff to it to an aggregator who would
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
then take it who has a permit so that in
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
that case they wouldn't need to be
 
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.630 align:start position:0%
that case they wouldn't need to be
permitted

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you ma'am chair and thank you
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative so um i see a conflict
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
kind of like with like when we talk
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
about a hannafords or something like
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
that um you know
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
that they would probably have to sell to
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
a post-use aggregator because
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if they want to get into
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
the business of solid waste
 
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.950 align:start position:0%
the business of solid waste
and

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
what would the cost be to them if they
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
had to do that
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh i do not know that is that is one of
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
the uh things that i have not had a
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to des about and um
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
that is one of the
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
things that would have to be dealt with
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
in a flora minute
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative bixby i'm
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
i've got a question about uh
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
in your amendment the definition of um
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
the advanced recycling
 
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.470 align:start position:0%
the advanced recycling
products

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean you said that this
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
definition indicates that
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
these new products that wouldn't be
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
recycled but i'm not sure i see it where
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
it says that how does it indicate that
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
these products would only be used for
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
and doesn't that leave wiggle room for
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
for the facility to
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
create products
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
that might suit their business model but
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
might not be considered recycling per se
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not quite sure where are you on
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
page one yeah page one
 
00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
page one yeah page one
uh

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this chapter the
 
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this chapter the
products

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
will include monomers all you know
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
oligomers plastics
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
waxes lubricants and coatings and you
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
say that that indicates
 
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
say that that indicates
that

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
these products would be
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
counted as recycling for them but
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes couldn't couldn't they then say well
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're creating products that
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know suit our business model but
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is within the realm of possibility
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure to what extent we can uh
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
we would have the power to do that under
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
existing existing laws and i don't i
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not i i'd
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um i conceivably they could
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.549 align:start position:0%
so um i conceivably they could
um

00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
although this list have here is a pretty
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
big laundry list so
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh that's pretty much everything that
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
would conceivably be coming out of a
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis reactor or gasification
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
reactor i i just have i also have
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
questions about the wording where it
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
says the for the purposes of this
 
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.190 align:start position:0%
says the for the purposes of this
chapter

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure why that's in there it
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
again it sort of gives them a
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
a loophole to run around and say well
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's you know we're doing this but it's
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
not for the purposes of this chapter per
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
se okay so the the phrase for the
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter is um
 
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter is um
a

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.789 align:start position:0%
a
um

00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
it essentially that that's a fairly
 
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.070 align:start position:0%
it essentially that that's a fairly
standard

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
way of
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
saying that and so so sometimes you
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes a word is used in law
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
that is has a fairly specific meaning
 
00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:53.990 align:start position:0%
that is has a fairly specific meaning
and

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
if you just go with the general miriam's
 
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.149 align:start position:0%
if you just go with the general miriam's
dictionary

00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
dictionary
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
meaning of that word you're going to get
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to come out with something
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense
 
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.789 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense
and

00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:06.549 align:start position:0%
and
for

00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
or if you define something in one place
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
in law
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
and then you there's a completely
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
unrelated statute where you run into a
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
similar word
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
then uh that could create a conflict so
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
by putting in the phrase for the
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter it narrows the
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
scope of where that definition is going
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be um valid now it might be that we
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
need to
um

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
add that definition in if there are
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
going to be other
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
if there are going to be other chapters
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
that are going to be
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
um also governing
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling we may need to
 
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.870 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling we may need to
um

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
we may need to look at
 
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.230 align:start position:0%
we may need to look at
uh

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
sort of in including the definition in
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
those other chapters as well but that's
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
something i need to need to find out
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
from des i don't know
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh if this is going to be sufficiently
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
global to cover what des needs to
 
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.789 align:start position:0%
global to cover what des needs to
regulate

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
but the the main idea is that this this
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
definition has to do with
 
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.669 align:start position:0%
definition has to do with
this

00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
specifically with the statute that is
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to be governing these uh these
 
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.990 align:start position:0%
going to be governing these uh these
operations

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you did i see another hand river
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
than it comes why yes
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
so on
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
going with uh what representative kaplan
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
was talking about on page one line
 
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
was talking about on page one line
twenty

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
twenty
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
it says that um shall not include for
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the shelter
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
shall not include hydrocarbons which are
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
marketed sold or used as fuel energy so
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
so if i go over here
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it talks about
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
cycling raids advanced shell report the
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
masses of polymer
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
in the mass process used for fuel for
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.549 align:start position:0%
the department
now

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
we've heard that some of these plants
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
are using fuel
 
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.789 align:start position:0%
are using fuel
uh

00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
the recyclable fuel to help generate the
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
energy at their plants would this
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit that no it would not
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:17.269 align:start position:0%
that is the
so

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
specifically when it says the products
 
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.070 align:start position:0%
specifically when it says the products
are

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh of advanced recycling
 
00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:23.750 align:start position:0%
uh of advanced recycling
it's

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.470 align:start position:0%
it's
the

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
it won't count as recycling
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
it comes it's a product of pyrolysis it
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
is not a product of
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a we appreciate that
 
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.710 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a we appreciate that
clarification

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
but if any changes were going to be made
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
further i would recommend that
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
some specific wording be included that
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
the material could be used to fuel a
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
plant or the process to remove the
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
questions because we've already had a
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
couple of questions on that which you've
 
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.230 align:start position:0%
couple of questions on that which you've
clarified

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
but to make the law clear to avoid
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
further discrepancy
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
a change to permit the use of the fuel
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
stocks for process and plant would be
 
00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.909 align:start position:0%
stocks for process and plant would be
helpful

00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
the aggregator for just a moment
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
we talked about the example of hannaford
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
you know with their plastic products and
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
wraps going to into the process
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
but why should they have to have a
 
00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.029 align:start position:0%
but why should they have to have a
permit

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
they're not drawing from outside other
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
stocks and they could sell to a licensed
 
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.870 align:start position:0%
stocks and they could sell to a licensed
aggregator

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
aggregator
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
why would they need a permit if they
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
were going to sell to the license
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
aggregator we're putting a burden on
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
people with permitting every time
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
somebody handles a piece of plastic i
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
don't think that's appropriate so the
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
the idea here is that um the
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh whatever whatever
 
00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.390 align:start position:0%
uh whatever whatever
um

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
plastic gets considered post-use polymer
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
when it's delivered to the advanced
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
recycling plant needs to be
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
essentially certified as being a an
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
acceptable post-use polymer polymer not
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
mixed with trash etc so um
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
in order to uh in order to make sure
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
that anybody who is delivering to a post
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
use onto an advanced recycling facility
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
is in fact delivering the appropriate uh
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
essentially product of of the
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
materials recovery uh there needs to be
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
a permit in order to make sure that they
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
know uh what what they're doing and i i
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
would envision that this would not be a
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
particularly onerous or expensive
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
permitting process it's not
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
not on the same level as say you know
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
putting up a landfill or something it's
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
just making sure that whoever is doing
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
this has the
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure capacity to do it
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
you may follow up
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
all right that clarifies it so if if
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
hannaford or any other large
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
business or corporation is dealing
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
directly to the plant
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
then they need to be permitted so that
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
the type of material is is known and
 
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.310 align:start position:0%
the type of material is is known and
certified

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
but you know there's a possibility that
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
there are third-party aggregators
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the market who are licensed and they
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
could do that clearance work if
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
hannaford was to sell to a third party
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then the third party aggregator then
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
goes directly to the plant is that an
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
optional case yes and in that case
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
hannaford would not need a permit
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
and they might decide that's the simpler
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
route to take
 
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
route to take
you

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like we're running a little
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
bit short um i just want to point out uh
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative bixby one second please
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative bolden yeah i was
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually just gonna ask um do we have a
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a deadline for this and i think
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
we need to exec this before 10 30 is
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
that correct should we
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
move through that or yes i i'd like to
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
just briefly uh take a moment among the
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
sub committee members only to sort of
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
have a brief discussion about where we
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
want to go with things
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
if you feel like we're
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the last five minutes going to
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
bump up against time i can recess this
 
00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:28.230 align:start position:0%
bump up against time i can recess this
at

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
30 after the chairman can open and
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
recess the other hearing and we could
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
finish our business quickly
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
but if let's see where we get to having
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
this discussion briefly among the
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members representative
 
00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members representative
bolden

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
bolden
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i i looked at
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment i still have a lot of um a
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
lot of questions and i received a lot of
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
emails on this bill and i tried to do
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
some independent research and most of
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
the actually all of the
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
information that i found about advanced
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
recycling was really from the industry i
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
didn't see a lot of um
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
independent science so i i
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
i think we really need to study this
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
further that's kind of the direction
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
that i would want to go personally
 
00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:11.029 align:start position:0%
that i would want to go personally
um

00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm i wouldn't support the amendment
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
personally at this point
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative stapleton
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm perfectly comfortable it seems like
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
we split hairs here but i could see the
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
importance of making uh distinguish
 
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.950 align:start position:0%
importance of making uh distinguish
between

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
recycling and the marketable materials
 
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.789 align:start position:0%
recycling and the marketable materials
and

00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like we've got it covered in
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
great detail i'm fully satisfied with
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
the way this amendment was constructed
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative columbus thank
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.549 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
so

00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
my thoughts are is that
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think um that advanced recycling um is
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
a positive
 
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.830 align:start position:0%
a positive
however

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.110 align:start position:0%
however
um

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know i guess my question is is
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
if we took a little bit more time and
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
just uh reintroduced this in a cleaner
 
00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
just uh reintroduced this in a cleaner
form

00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
um for it to come back
 
00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.630 align:start position:0%
um for it to come back
um

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm really torn
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
um just gonna throw that out there
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we've gone a long way
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
towards crafting a good piece of
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislation uh given what we what we've
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
known so far and our time constraints um
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
the problem is i don't think we have had
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
enough time and
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think we've done the detailed
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
analysis that something like this really
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh really deserves i mean this might be
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
a good thing it might be a good thing
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
for our state's priorities in terms of
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
solid waste management
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
and and we want to balance that with the
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
interests of the business to have a fair
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework and you know i
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
understand that that's something that's
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
also a priority but we need to balance
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
those too and it's not an easy thing to
 
00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:42.870 align:start position:0%
those too and it's not an easy thing to
do

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
whenever we you know contemplate
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
something like a bottle bill or
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
composting or something like that we do
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
a detailed analysis a thorough analysis
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
before we move forward and i think
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do with this so
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm for interim first study thank you in
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
the interest of time i am going to
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
chairman put this in
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee work session into a
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
brief recess
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
and then i will have chairman pearl come
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
forward and do the things the chairman
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
pearl needs to do so
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
sb367 stands in recess for a few moments
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you it is 10 30 so um i'm going to
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
quickly open
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 368 and i'm going to
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
immediately put it into recess until 10
 
00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:33.029 align:start position:0%
immediately put it into recess until 10
45.

00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
so i will turn the floor back over to
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
you and give you 15 more minutes to wrap
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
up but we are going to have to be done
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
and moving by 10 45. i understand thank
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
you mr chair thank you
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that i will reopen
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing or the excuse me the
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee works session on sb 367. it
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
is now open and i will defer to the
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
members of the solid waste subcommittee
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative contoir um
 
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
representative contoir um
just

00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
for interest i think that
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
the new
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
bill the new amendment drafted
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
by representative bixby
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
should be adopted because it does
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
clarify things further so i would make a
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt that amendment at this
 
00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.590 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt that amendment at this
time

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
yes it's just a procedural question um
 
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.070 align:start position:0%
yes it's just a procedural question um
if

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
if i wanted for example the subcommittee
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
in my opinion to adopt interim study
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
would i vote against the amendment
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
because i think if we adopt the
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative contra
 
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.590 align:start position:0%
representative contra
so

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding we can adopt the
 
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.190 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding we can adopt the
amendment

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
and that way we can pass that but then
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
when we go further we can actually ask
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
for interim study but that way the
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
amendment is in the records
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
it would be my understanding but i'm not
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
positive we could defer to

amendment it can be reintroduced in the
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
executive session as well so
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%

i don't believe there is a conflict in
that

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%

that what you're saying thank you
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%

so

00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%

name is representative howard pearl from
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack 26
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
and i am here today to speak to
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
2022-16748 which is an amendment to
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 368.
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
so as we heard testimony on senate bill
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
368 originally we identified a concern
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
that the department and the commissioner
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
had brought before us
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the ability for individuals
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
to transfer animals without a health
 
00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.910 align:start position:0%
to transfer animals without a health
certificate

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
even though it was
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
technically not legal to do so because
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
in 437
 
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.190 align:start position:0%
in 437
8

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
8
 
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.710 align:start position:0%
8
paragraph

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
5 now excuse me paragraph 6 under
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
current statute it says that no person
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
shall transfer without a health
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
certificate unless they have an
 
00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
certificate unless they have an
exception

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
but what's been happening is there was
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
no teeth to the to enforce the law there
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
was no penalty clause in 437-10
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly the history of how
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
that was eliminated but it appears
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
originally 437.10 which is the penalty
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
portion says any pet vendor who
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
transfers live animals it doesn't
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
include anyone else who's not a pet
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
vendor so what this amendment does is uh
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
section one and two is the original bill
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh in 368 and section three
 
00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:51.109 align:start position:0%
uh in 368 and section three
adds

00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
adds
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
the language in 437 10 which says any
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
person who transfers ownership of a live
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
dog cat or ferret without an official
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
certificate of transfor transfer
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
or any pet vendor and it
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
then makes them subject to a misdemeanor
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
and which is misdemeanor is in current
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
law for the pet vendors
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
and we will be adding the language on
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
the end
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
and may be subject to an administrative
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
fine levied by the commissioner not to
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
exceed one thousand dollars for each
 
00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
exceed one thousand dollars for each
violation

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
and additionally in
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
amendment 1674
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
section 4 and section 5 we had put the
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
new paragraph in in 437.8
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
saying no person firm corporation or
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
other entity she'll transfer ownership
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
of a dog cat or ferret without an
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
official health certificate
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason that section 5 is there
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
is because we had made a change last
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
year when we put the database bill
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
changing health certificate to official
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
certificate of transfer
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why you see duplicate language
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
in section 4 and 5 of the bill
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the amendment excuse me
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
but what we realized in conversation
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
since i drafted this amendment i've
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
spoken with the commissioner and
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
and with other members and we've figured
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
out that this was already currently in
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
statute in 437 8 section 6 or 7
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
depending on which version you're
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
looking at and that's that's where the
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
confusion comes in
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
because the database version moved it to
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
section 7 the original language statute
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
has it in section 6. so that that's why
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
you see it listed twice and that's where
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
some confusion was coming in and we
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
figured out through uh my conversations
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
with ols and with the commissioner that
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
we really don't need section four and
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
five because it's already in statute in
 
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.430 align:start position:0%
five because it's already in statute in
437.8

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
437.8
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
so what i've done is i've drafted a new
 
00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
so what i've done is i've drafted a new
amendment

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment 17808
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
which i handed out to all of you today
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
which is the exact same amendment as the
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
original one except we eliminated
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
section 4 and 5 because we realized we
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
didn't need them so it cleans it up and
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
leaves the current statute in place
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
where it was already required for
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
anybody to have a health certificate
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
and this just
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
puts in a penalty phase in section three
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
action three of the bill so that anyone
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
who does violate the current statute now
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
is subject to the same thing that the
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
pet vendors have been subject to so it
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
basically levels the playing field for
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
every person who's transferring an
 
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.870 align:start position:0%
every person who's transferring an
animal

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
animal
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the uh
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
quick uh
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
description of what's happening in in
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know with this amendment and i'm
 
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.750 align:start position:0%
you know with this amendment and i'm
certainly

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
welcome to take any questions and
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
answer any further questions if i
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking a
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
and you may not be able to answer this
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
and this may be for the commissioner but
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
even though everyone is legally required
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
to get a health certificate to transfer
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
an uh
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know one of these animals
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
most of the public is not educated in
 
00:51:06.319 --> 00:51:07.270 align:start position:0%
most of the public is not educated in
that

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
what is going to be um what are we going
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be doing to educate the public so
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
so with my i'll answer it the best i can
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
and if you want a further explanation
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
then i'll certainly the commissioner has
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
made himself available to answer and
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'll let him
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
answer that after if you'd like in my
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
conversations with the commissioner
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
this is an area where um that
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
it is currently in statute and
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
what they're looking to do is is have
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
some enforcement action if they feel
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know it's it says that they
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
they may be subject to an administrative
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
fine levied by the commissioner not to
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
exceed a thousand dollars for each
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
violation they're not going to go on any
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
any um heated hunt for
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
you giving your dog to your son any more
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
than they ever have been the statue is
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to remain the same the language is
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
the same on this
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
this just gives them some ability to
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:16.390 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
representative

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm gonna turn mine back onto
 
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.510 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm gonna turn mine back onto
so

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
the the individual button turn shows on
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
and off the other one mutes everybody
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to speak uh
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
nope

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
nope
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
if not i will
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to uh open up an
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
executive session and since we're still
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
fresh on senate bill 368 we'll start
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
with that one we have two bills to exact
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with the senate bill 368
 
00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with the senate bill 368
and

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.510 align:start position:0%
i will
move

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 368 ought to pass and i will
 
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.270 align:start position:0%
senate bill 368 ought to pass and i will
offer

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
gonna make sure i got the right one
 
00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:50.390 align:start position:0%
gonna make sure i got the right one
2022-17808

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
i will second that okay so we'll be
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have a motion and a second on
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
amendment 2022-17808
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
for senate bill 368. i'll recognize
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
myself to speak briefly
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
as i just explained in the hearing this
 
00:54:14.079 --> 00:54:14.870 align:start position:0%
as i just explained in the hearing this
um

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
this cleaned up a loophole that was
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
there is one other piece that i
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
that we had changed in the original bill
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
but actually i guess i got to stay nope
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
it is in the amendment we also capped
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
the revolving fund at 75 000
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
my apologies i forgot to mention that in
 
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
my apologies i forgot to mention that in
my

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony on the amendment
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
that's in section one line 17
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
and so this will only allow the
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner to draw
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh up to 75 000
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
a year out for the
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh for the hearing officer position and
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
we did that to address some concerns
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
that we had had from some folks that
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
they felt like they were
 
00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:01.349 align:start position:0%
they felt like they were
potentially

00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
opening up a situation where
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
the department could go after new fines
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
with this hearing officer by you know
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
basically creating a bounty system and
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
this this will take care of that because
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
the feeds the fees that they currently
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
receive are far in excess of 75 000 so
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
no advantage for them to be chasing any
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
new ones
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
yes so what what we have before us now
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be a fairly simple and
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill that i hope we can
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
all support
 
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.789 align:start position:0%
all support
uh

00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
how we got here was not simple and
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
straightforward and i'd really like to
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank representative pearl for the hard
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
work he's done in terms of orchestrating
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
all the various ins and outs that got us
 
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.510 align:start position:0%

here

calendar
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
i think so because there's no
 
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.349 align:start position:0%
i think so because there's no
appropriation

00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%

retract that
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
i want to recognize representative
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
murray actually to bring forward the um
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
results from the subcommittee my
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
apologies i get ahead of myself that's
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you chairman pearl so out of
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee there was a
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation of four to three for
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
interim study do i have that correct uh
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
madam clerk
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
the motion was four to three for interim
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
study correct that is correct thank you
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
and so i'd like to just say that while
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
the well
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
we believe that the concept definitely
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
has merit it is important that we move
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
forward with careful intention for
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
the next steps because this is a very
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
complex piece of legislation that we
 
01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
complex piece of legislation that we
feel

01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.670 align:start position:0%
feel
um

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
is important that we get right before
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
moving forward and so
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
that is the reason the subcommittee came
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the vote of
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
interim study on the bill as amended by
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
the senate thank you
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and i want to
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
certainly commend the subcommittee they
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
did a fantastic job and
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
a very thorough and
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
did a lot of due diligence in
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
so uh representative murray is moving
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
interim study do we have a second
 
01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.390 align:start position:0%
interim study do we have a second
representative

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
dutsy all right so we have a motion and
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
a second uh i'll recognize
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative murray to speak to her
 
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.270 align:start position:0%
representative murray to speak to her
motion

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um so again i
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that there is any uh more
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
that i need to say i do feel that um we
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
do need to continue to look at the
 
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.870 align:start position:0%
do need to continue to look at the
varying

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
varying
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
facets of of the bill and so for that
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
reason i am continuing with that motion
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyone else
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
that wants to speak uh representative
 
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.589 align:start position:0%
that wants to speak uh representative
stapleton

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
stapleton
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i was in the
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
minority vote on the recommendation for
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
and i continue to be um
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
opposed to that
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
i think we've sifted and augured this
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
bill as thoroughly as humanly possible
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
at the inception of this new technology
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
or emerging technology
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
and while there's a few items that might
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
be tweaked or corrected i think they're
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
minor enough in nature that we should go
 
01:03:50.079 --> 01:03:51.109 align:start position:0%
minor enough in nature that we should go
ahead

01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll no doubt have some
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
amendments as years go by and
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
let's do it then when we can aggregate
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
it and make a better work of uh further
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh minor amendments interim study
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
is just delaying what we need
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
and there's no real reason for it this
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
bill is as thorough we've had expert
 
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.309 align:start position:0%
bill is as thorough we've had expert
testimony

01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
good inputs from industry and other
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
sources it's time to move the bill
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
forward so i would recommend vote no on
 
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
forward so i would recommend vote no on
the

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
interim studies so that another
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
um yes i support the vote of uh interim
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
study and the reason is one of the
 
01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:40.470 align:start position:0%
study and the reason is one of the
things

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
this is my fourth year on this committee
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we've always been
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
proud of is how thoroughly we've looked
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
at the language of a bill and how
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
thoroughly we have vetted it
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
for some of the new members that may not
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
be aware i mean we've spent two years
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
working on language to define the word
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture and to define the word soil
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
in a bill because we take our
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislative responsibilities very
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
seriously this is a bill with technology
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
that has far-reaching consequences for
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
so many
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions data-based
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
quantitative questions that we have
 
01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
quantitative questions that we have
asked

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
the supposed experts who have not been
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
able to give us any information
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
on this and i'll just give you one
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
example one example
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
is that per their
 
01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
is that per their
information

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
one unit that they create will take care
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
of something like 12 000 pounds or 12
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
000 tons
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
of refuge
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
what's a unit
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
how big is a unit is a unit as much as
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
this room
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
how does 12
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
000 tons relate to the 35 million tons
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
of plastic that we create every year
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is database driven this is data
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
driven they cannot give us any answers
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
on this
so

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
going ahead and saying let's put this in
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
interim study we have a good record
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
in this committee of actually studying
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
bills that go into interim study to do
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
this for another year
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
any further
 
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.589 align:start position:0%
any further
comments

01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make one and
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
i again i appreciate the great work that
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee has done they've
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
brought a lot of information forward and
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
they they've got a tremendous amount of
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
information that helped me learn about a
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
process that i knew very little about
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
i certainly want to
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
give an awful lot of thanks to
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative bixby he's
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
he's not on the subcommittee but was
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
here for every subcommittee meeting and
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
has put it
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
done yeoman's work on developing a an
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
that will uh take care of an awful lot
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the concerns and questions that this
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee has had and so i i'm going to
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
vote against the interim study motion
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
because i'd like the opportunity for
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative bixby to introduce his
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to the whole committee and i
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
think it will answer most of the
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that we the committee will have
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
and has raised throughout the
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's work so
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
any further comments
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative contour
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
vote against interim study then
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's amendment would
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
be brought forth um and then we would
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
still at least we would have that as a
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that correct
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
if we vote against against interim saudi
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
then representative bixby can introduce
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
his amendment that's correct
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will ask the clerk to call

motion since it is his amendment
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
in looking at the uh what we got from
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
the senate there were a
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
number of deficiencies which i have
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
strived to address uh i
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
and i will
 
01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:36.870 align:start position:0%
and i will
um

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
say this with the caveat that some of
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
the changes in this bill have not been
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
run by des yet and i hope to do that
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
within the next week so that there may
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
be a floor amendment to
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
resolve a few minor things that have not
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
been entirely ironed out but i think
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
some of the key things that we that the
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
findings and purpose section which does
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
not have the weight of law but it does
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
establish legislative intent
 
01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:08.709 align:start position:0%
establish legislative intent
and

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh one of the and the key part of this
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
it uh emphasizes that any advanced
 
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.189 align:start position:0%
it uh emphasizes that any advanced
recycling

01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
facility would be
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
subject to all state and local state and
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
having to do with clean air clean water
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
waste and land use
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
so uh these it's this bill does not
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
remove the um regula these facilities
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
from regulation it just makes sure that
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
they are regulated as manufacturers as
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to being solid waste facilities
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
the next change in the um that the
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendment makes is in the definition of
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
and there was some concern that uh the
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
way that the
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill came to us from the senate they
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
could just be using these plants to turn
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
plastic into fuel
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh and so uh what uh
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
the the addition to uh what this
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
amendment does in that section is
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that for the purposes of this
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
chapter products of advanced recycling
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
shall not include
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbons which are marketed sold or
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
used as fuel for energy
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh just a clarifying thing there uh that
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
means that uh
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a use for fuel it would not
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
count as recycling so
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
a plant would be able to
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
use some of the product of pyrolysis for
 
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.390 align:start position:0%
use some of the product of pyrolysis for
example

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
as a way to fuel their reactors
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
but that would be
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
essentially in the same category as far
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
as recycling is concerned as product
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
process waste as opposed to
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
product produced
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
so it would not count towards their
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
recycling goals
 
01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.669 align:start position:0%
recycling goals
um

01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
are the
 
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.149 align:start position:0%
are the
uh

01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
there are i made uh some small changes
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
to uh the various process definitions of
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
various processes to uh clarify that uh
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
the what comes out of the various
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
processes that they list such as
 
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.830 align:start position:0%
processes that they list such as
pyrolysis

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
gasification depolarization
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
is essentially raw material it is not
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
a finished product uh the
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh after those processes happen there
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be further
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh refining uh or
 
01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:38.470 align:start position:0%
uh refining uh or
distilling

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
distilling
 
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.270 align:start position:0%
distilling
to

01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
isolate the specific materials that then
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
get used as raw materials for making
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
plastics those plastic plastics or
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
lubricants or waxes could be also made
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
within the facility but uh just the
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
the processes that break down the
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
plastic are different from the processes
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
that make new plastic is is the point of
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
making those changes
 
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.790 align:start position:0%
making those changes
um

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.910 align:start position:0%
um
a

01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
minor change to the definition of
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
post-use polymer uh
 
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.189 align:start position:0%
post-use polymer uh
it

01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
says that it's not mixed with solid
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
waste or hazardous waste uh the bill
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
as it came to us said on site or in the
 
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.630 align:start position:0%
as it came to us said on site or in the
process

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
process
but

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.390 align:start position:0%
but
because

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
we've added a section about post-use
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
polymer aggregators
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
then there needs to be a definition of
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
post-use polymer that is what that
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
aggregator produces and then the on-site
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
would uh part of that would be uh
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
essentially a conflict with the idea of
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
the aggregator uh the post-use polymer
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
aggregator is uh a
 
01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.709 align:start position:0%
aggregator is uh a
um

01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
is basically some entity that
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
has a permit to collect
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
plastics and sort them clean them and
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
provide them in a ready-to-use form
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
to the advanced recycling facility or to
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
a mechanical
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
recycling facility
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
putting that
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
additional um
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
entity in there makes it possible to
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
specify at what point the plastic ceases
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
to be considered solid waste and starts
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
to be considered a
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
product that is
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
or a feedstock that is used by the
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
advanced recyclers so uh
 
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.310 align:start position:0%
advanced recyclers so uh
once

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
the aggregator has processed the
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
plastics uh to the specifications of the
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
advanced recycler
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
they are then considered not solid waste
 
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.149 align:start position:0%
they are then considered not solid waste
uh

01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh
the

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:42.550 align:start position:0%

that
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the definition of solid waste that
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
information is about what counts and
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't count as solid waste is is
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.790 align:start position:0%

uh
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
there is a um as it came to this from
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
came to us from the senate there was
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
some language that had been approved by
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
des saying that they have the capacity
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
to go into a plant and make sure that um
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
the materials uh that are used as the
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
feedstock for advanced recycling are not
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
nuisance or do not
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
pose a threat to the environment uh i
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
have added
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
to that language which is uh similar to
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
the original bill in the
 
01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.189 align:start position:0%
the original bill in the
[Music]

01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
senate which says the department may
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
inspect and enter any advanced recycling
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
facility to ensure compliance with all
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
applicable statutes
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
and departmental rules relative to air
 
01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.030 align:start position:0%
and departmental rules relative to air
water

01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
waste and land use and taken for action
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions necessary
 
01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.270 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions necessary
uh

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's i'm going to need i need to talk
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
with des to make sure that this is
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
actually aimed at the you know
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
is ends up in the correct
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
part of their their statutes but i want
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
they have authority under all of the
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
different uh regulatory authorities that
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
they have and for clean air or hazardous
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
waste etc to do any necessary
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
inspections it may be that this is uh in
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
fact already covered under those
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
statutes in which case
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
you that it might be amended out in a um
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
in a floor amendment but i need to check
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
with them to make sure exactly
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i need to make sure that they
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
will have all the authority under all
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
the applicable statutes to regulate
 
01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.510 align:start position:0%
the applicable statutes to regulate
um

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.390 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh products of advanced recycling shall
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
not be considered waste derived products
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
or are
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
derive fuel that is something that um
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
those are it was in the original bill
 
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
those are it was in the original bill
and

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh the idea there is that uh
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
once uh once a plastic or another
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
material comes out of one of these
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling material facilities
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
it is essentially functioning as if it
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
the same way that something was made
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
from uh other
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
um chemical sources would be so uh it
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
would not have any conflicts with feud
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
food use etc
 
01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.870 align:start position:0%
food use etc
um

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
and uh the
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
had a phrase about advanced recycling
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
facilities shall um
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i think was something emphasized
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh using post-use polymers from
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
recovered feed stocks generated within
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
the state uh and we have strengthened
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
that to make it a priority rather than
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.550 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
then reporting for solid waste reduction
 
01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.990 align:start position:0%
then reporting for solid waste reduction
goals

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
goals
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
this is something in terms of the exact
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
phrasing i need to check with the es uh
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
it might need some tweaking but uh the
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
key thing here is that uh there are
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
various things that come out of the
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
processes like pyrolysis or gasification
 
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.870 align:start position:0%
processes like pyrolysis or gasification
uh

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
if it's being done right then the
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
largest fraction of that roughly eighty
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
percent uh one hopes is um recycled
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
product which would be chemical which
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
would essentially be the the chemicals
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
that can then be turned into new
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
plastics it is conceivable that those
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
chemicals can be used as fuel and what
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
this section does is it makes sure that
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
no residual material
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh and no pro material used as um
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
used for fuel would count as part of the
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
recycling goals that would that would
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
count essentially in the waste category
 
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.590 align:start position:0%
count essentially in the waste category
uh

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh
and

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.590 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
then i also uh
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
requested made uh put in a
 
01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
requested made uh put in a
um

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
a paragraph which requires that all
 
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
a paragraph which requires that all
wastes

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
wastes
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
produced by the facility be reported i
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe that's consistent with what the
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
epa requires but i think that we need to
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
have as much transparency transparency
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh anything you know
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
any sorts of wastes whether um you know
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
emissions or
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
or hazardous material that gets shipped
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
for dealing with elsewhere
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh needs to be accounted for uh so um
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's basically what the amendment does
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that it adds some some real
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh strength to what we got from the
 
01:19:41.679 --> 01:19:43.270 align:start position:0%
uh strength to what we got from the
senate

01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate all of your hard work
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
and your thorough explanation of the
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
changes in this amendment
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments from the committee
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative bolden
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
i think thank you mr chairman um i'm
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
definitely going to support the
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
amendment i think it
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
is a significant improvement to the
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um but i'm gonna oppose
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
the bill because i i don't think it's
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time i don't think it's
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be so that's kind of
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
my thought on it
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any other thoughts
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative murray i too would like
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
to echo that sentiment i believe that i
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
could support the amendment but i don't
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
any further representative stapleton
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'm fully satisfied with the amendment
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
realizing there's some
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
minor points that may be uh added to it
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
or amended to it uh to make it a little
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
better we can always do that as we go
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
along from the floor amendment or onward
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm in full support of ot pea on the
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment any further
 
01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:51.830 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment any further

we have an
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%

i'll second that representative bixby
seconds

01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%

and i will
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
recognize myself
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i will just say i again thank the
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee for all of their work on this
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill and i certainly want to echo the
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
sentiments that were brought up earlier
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
i believe it was by representative
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
duttsy about the due diligence of this
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee and the hard work that they
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
put into every bill and the thoughtful
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh conversations that we have and i
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
while we have some bills occasionally we
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
may not always come down on the same
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
side i appreciate the professionalism
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
and the courtesy that this committee
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
sets in a high bar as an example for the
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
rest of the house committees to follow
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we are regularly recognized for
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
our collegiality amongst our committee
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i i certainly appreciate that it's
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
the best committee to be the chair of i
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
will tell you
 
01:22:45.199 --> 01:22:45.910 align:start position:0%
will tell you
so

01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
with that i would ask the committee to
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
to support the bill as amended i feel
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
like we've done a really good job and i
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
certainly again want to
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
show appreciation to representative
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
bixby for all of his hard work
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative conform thank you mr
 
01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
representative conform thank you mr
chair

01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
um as i stated before i'm really torn
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
about this bill although i think that
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative bixby has done a great
 
01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.350 align:start position:0%
representative bixby has done a great
job

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the fact that he's
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to continue to do more work on
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
this and bring another floor amendment
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
um to the the house floor which i hope
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
that if this does pass that everyone
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
would support
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure that it will be good um
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
having not read it i can't commit 100
 
01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:26.550 align:start position:0%
having not read it i can't commit 100
um

01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
the world is a wash and plastic waste it
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
follows the oceans and
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
big areas of flotation close plastic
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
waste that they're trying to scoop up
 
01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.629 align:start position:0%
waste that they're trying to scoop up
and

01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
gargantuan task
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
this process has been in effect we know
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
for at least 10 years not only in this
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
country but worldwide that technology is
 
01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:00.709 align:start position:0%
country but worldwide that technology is
developing

01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:01.590 align:start position:0%
developing
um

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
there there's a
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
aura of of care and concern on the part
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the manufacturers to make sure the
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
process is clean
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
and uh as little
 
01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.189 align:start position:0%
and uh as little
effluent

01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
effluent
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
in air and water as possible
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get better in the
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
technology let's start the ball rolling
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
and start to bite into the massive waste
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
plastic that we have
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
flooding over us and get this bill going
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm supporting
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh the ought to pass
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i also want to thank
 
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
everyone who worked on this um including
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
the chairman and for
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
the collective work that our body always
 
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.470 align:start position:0%
the collective work that our body always
does

01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
while the concept i agree representative
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
stapleton definitely has merit i will be
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
voting against the ought to pass as
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
amended motion
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i believe that new hampshire has had
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
a long-standing
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
and complicated history with pollution
 
01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
and complicated history with pollution
affecting

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
everyone from our military to first
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
responders communities their water
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
sources soil and other natural resources
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
is one that i
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
would want to make sure that we are are
 
01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
would want to make sure that we are are
very

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
clear in the source traceability of our
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
aggregated materials to ensure that our
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
state and the participants and
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders aren't stuck
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to materials that may be
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
deemed hazardous or have other trace
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
elements in it
 
01:25:34.239 --> 01:25:35.590 align:start position:0%
elements in it
and

01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
so with that it should also be noted
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
that we currently don't have a materials
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
recovery facility in the state and i'm
 
01:25:42.159 --> 01:25:43.189 align:start position:0%
recovery facility in the state and i'm
unsure

01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
unsure
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
at this point if the intersection of the
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
aggregation and murphs
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
might be conflicted in statute with one
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
another so i definitely
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
will be voting no but i thank everyone
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
who has worked on this because i do
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
think that um with the appropriate
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
amount of time we can get to a place
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
where all of my concerns and maybe those
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
of others would be ameliorated so i
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%

gonna vote no i you know there's a
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
apparently there might be a floor
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and and uh if that's the case
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'll decide in the moment um but i can't
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
support what we have in front of us
 
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.350 align:start position:0%

representative dutzy
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i would just like to say that if we

could um
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
if we could have faith in corporations
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing then why do we
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
have thousands and thousands of
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%

up from the pollution of corporations
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
who took their profits
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
went bankrupt and then left the public
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%

i haven't talked to howard about this
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
alright yet so i'm i'm wondering if uh
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
we should we could have some something
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
like a uh
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
a uh committee picnic or something like
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
that and uh he has a really nice place
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
out loud and we maybe maybe could use
 
01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.430 align:start position:0%
out loud and we maybe maybe could use
that

01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
i feel like i just was
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
set up to offer my farm for a committee
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
picnic this summer
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
you were
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh would the committee like to do
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
something like that would people be in
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
favor of it over the summer i know we
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
kind of all have difficult schedules
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
myself included
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
as you know my day job is farming and
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is a challenge but we could
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
certainly look for a time if the
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
committee would like to entertain that
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
idea said
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
yes what sounds like a good idea even
 
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:15.730 align:start position:0%
the substitutes would like to
 
01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:18.390 align:start position:0%
the substitutes would like to
[Laughter]

01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
yeah

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:18.670 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:18.670 --> 01:29:20.790 align:start position:0%
yeah
[Laughter]

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
all right so well what i'll do then
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
child of a farm
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
might i suggest that you have this
 
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
might i suggest that you have this
picnic

01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
picnic
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
at a time when you're bailing hay
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
and that you issue gloves and uh
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
and and make use of people it could be
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
like a uh
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
a working farm you know a picnic
 
01:29:52.229 --> 01:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
well if it's going to be true to life
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
you won't get any gloves i'm sorry we we
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
just toughen up and deal with it so
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
anyway well now listen to i i appreciate
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
that we'll uh i'll send an email around
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the committee then and we'll look to
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
see if we can find a common time i know
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a challenge because we
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
do we do have a lot of vacation things
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
and folks do in the summer and i
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that but i i would
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
say probably a mid-july or early july
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
something like that might work on my end
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
i kind of have to fit it between the
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
seasons as we're rolling but
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
i will uh send something around and
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can all
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know give some feedback as to when
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
what availability would be on that
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
so beyond that i don't think we have
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
anything else unless pixby has any
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
forgotten anything
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
not at the moment there's another thing
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of coming up but it won't be
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
until the fall is uh
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
a representative aaron and i are going
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
to be discussing with the folks at unh
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh about possibly a tour of the
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
greenhouses and woodman farm and uh
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
veterinary pathology lab
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
so there's one final thing we're going
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
to have happen here as a committee we
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
have um one of the groups that's in here
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
very regularly doing uh presenting
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
testimony on on bills and we certainly
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate all that do but the dog
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
owners of the granite state have
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
had a custom painting of our state dog
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
and angela if you want to come up and
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
angela ferrari is the uh
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to represent the dog owners of the
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
grand estate and she has a gift that she
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
wants to present to the full committee
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
and now uh i'll yield the floor to you
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you all i just wanted to
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
take this opportunity to provide this um
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
for all of the hard work that you all
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
have always done on behalf of the
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
animals and pet owners in new hampshire
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'll let
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
chairman pearl open this for you guys
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
sunday is also purebred dog day so we're
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
kind of aligned with that although we
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
didn't want to ask you to come in on
 
01:31:57.199 --> 01:31:58.629 align:start position:0%
didn't want to ask you to come in on
sunday

01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
sunday
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
a few years ago
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
meet the breeds on the state lawn with
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
covid we haven't been able to do that
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
for a few years and we're hoping to get
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
that back up and running here in the
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
future but wanted to take this
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present a painting that
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
you would hopefully be able to hang here
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%

01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
