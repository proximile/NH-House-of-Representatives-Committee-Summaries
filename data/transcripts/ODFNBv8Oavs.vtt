thank you Mr chairman so this amendment
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
is the same amendment that was offered
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
um previously in our executive session
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
for this bill this bill um clarifies
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
that the deputy town clerk must be a
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
resident of the
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
municipality and additionally the um
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
strikeouts put both sections 41 4 1
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
colon 18 and 669 colon 65 in in concert
 
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
with each other um further clarifying um
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
reason that that the town clerk the
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
deputy town clerk should be a resident
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
is that it's it's very clear
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
that the deputy town clerk shall be
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
qualified in the same manner as the Town
 
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
Clerk and the town clerk must be a
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
resident so um we heard during the
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
hearing the Secretary of
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
State testified that both the the the
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
Town Clerk and the deputy they um must
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
be residents due to privacy ISS issues
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
um they're responsible for recordkeeping
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
Vital Records births deaths marriages
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
adoptions they're also responsible for
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
matters related to registrations and
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
Licensing and additionally they're
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
involved with elections so they made it
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State made it very
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
clear that both positions must be
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
residences that they must have their
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
residence in in the town
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
also supported the amendment to to
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
clarify um the
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
statute so
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
um if there's
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
no if and then the important thing is is
 
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.750 align:start position:0%
that if
the

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
clerk is unable to perform the duties
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
for for various reasons that the deputy
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
is to fill in and the big problem with
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
the bill I meant the big problem is is
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
if the deputy were to needed to become
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
the clerk they would not be able to to
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
participate and run the elections so
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's this amendment is is important it
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the deputy be a
 
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.150 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the deputy be a
resident

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
um since the town clerks are are are
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
elected the deputy town
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
clerk still can be appointed
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%

the selectman
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
can appoint till the next election but
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
then the next election person would have
 
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.990 align:start position:0%
then the next election person would have
to

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%

disposed of by this committee
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
but that the prime sponsor was no longer
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
here therefore there was no need to
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
consult with the prime sponsor well I
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%

you like to speak to your amend uh
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um the house bill 202 this came
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
out of a commission
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
um from a bill in 2022 it was House Bill
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
411 so the commission was tasked with
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
two things first to study the
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
equalization rate used for the
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
calculation of property tax abatement
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
and also to establish a meth
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
method to equalize Market values for the
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of calculating property tax
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
abatements so the problem is that
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's an inequity because two
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
different Equalization rates were be are
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
currently being used they are um a year
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
apart one is used for tax ass assessment
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
purposes and the other one is used for
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
tax appeal purposes so this committee um
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
was charged to
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
establish a method to eliminate this
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
inequity and which which they did so um
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
this house bill 202 represents a much
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
needed uh solution and this is for th
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
for these brief reasons I could say more
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
um this bill um should be um ought to
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%

thank you

representative thank you would you like
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to your Amendment
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
you I would thanks
 
00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:23.789 align:start position:0%
you I would thanks
um

00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
so um I guess beginning history on this
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
was um that
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
I we um retain this bill because of some
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
kind of confusion I guess with the
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
language in the original bill regarding
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
turnover and um really the issue that
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
to um solve is
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
when when the facts on the ground and
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
the in the Community are being served by
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
a particular person um and they're
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
they're currently working in the job
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
that the the default would reflect their
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
actual pay
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
um and um I it was brought to my
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
attention um that if someone let's say
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh was currently working in a position
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
providing the services to the town um
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
for for
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
um for example $100,000 and then they
 
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
left and a new person was hired and
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
working in the job maybe not as senior
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
um for only $70,000 or
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
$75,000 the def and the default budget
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
for that following year that first year
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
of that new person's employ the default
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
budget would be $100,000 even though the
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
budget being asked for is actually only
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
70 or 75 to reflect the person's actual
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
pay that's getting in that
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
position um and uh that didn't seem
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
right and then also I was talking to
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative magori about about this
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
issue and it actually comes up also when
 
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
issue and it actually comes up also when
you

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
um hire for or you're proposing an
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely new position let's say for
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 because you don't know what the
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
person will actually be um hired at you
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
just put some placeholder number in the
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
budget so that the the voters have an
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to approve that um position
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
and uh then let's say that the voters do
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
approve that position at the $100,000
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
but then you go and hire someone and and
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
actually it's only $80,000 for the
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
person that is hired and they're working
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
on the job that next year's budget they
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
would be proposing an $80,000 to to
 
00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:58.149 align:start position:0%
would be proposing an $80,000 to to
fulfill

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
that that role with a person that's
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
currently working there however the
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
default budget would still be the
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 which doesn't make a whole lot
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
of sense um and so my uh attempt with
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment is to um essentially
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
achieve that uh that those people that
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
got hired at that uh potentially lower
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
rate would be uh
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
that the default Bud budget would
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
reflect that and so the language that I
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
put in um to clarify that is that that
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
the um the default budget would be
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
reflecting the actual salary and
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
benefits of filled positions therefore
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
if the position was not filled let's say
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
someone just left uh that you wouldn't
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
want to adjust that um that amount um
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
because you still need to have that
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
money available to be able to hire
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
someone um and so only for filled
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
positions um at the time of the uh the
 
00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:08.470 align:start position:0%
positions um at the time of the uh the
public

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
hearing you would have the default
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
budget reflect those those positions
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits um and then also
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
excluding any um um raises or anything
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
that you did in mid year since the last
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
time you had a budget uh p ask for that
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
so if the if the selectman for some
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
reason decided you know mid year that
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to give the town uh
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
administrator a 5% raise or something
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
mid year that wasn't approved by the
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
budget uh by the voters then that
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be part of the default budget
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
that it would just be the the pay the
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
last time and then they can propose that
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
raise in the in the new budget um
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's also on line seven uh language
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
that is the difference between the two
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
amendments um that language is just the
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
adding of by law to this phrase um and
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
other obligations previously incurred or
 
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
mandated by law so it's it would read
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
and other obligations previously
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
incurred by law or mandated by law um
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
this I don't have super strong feelings
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
about but there was some concern with
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
the um that some towns are essentially
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
um interpreting this phrase to say other
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
obligations previously incurred and then
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
being able to put something in the
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
budget even if it it's not required that
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
it is incurred let's say the Selectmen
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
decide that they're going to buy a new
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
back ho and they agree to buy the new
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
backhoe is that uh an obligation that
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
was pre previously incurred by the
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen right and they in in my
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
reading of the language technically that
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
would defeat the whole purpose of a
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
default budget and I don't think that
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
the the courts would actually allow such
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
um such a thing to happen but the person
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
that raised it to me um thought that
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
this language would um clarify it
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
without them having to sue the town for
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
for um their interpretation of this um
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
other obligations previously incurred um
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
so if the uh so that's why I'm proposing
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
uh this committee so thank you thank you
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
representative Rella for that very long
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
and detailed explanation of your
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment um however it does nothing to
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
address the basic fact that our current
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
governor has said that governance works
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
best at the local level and this
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and this B Bill does nothing
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
but extend the heavy hand of conquered
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
into the individual deliberations and
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
budget approval processes of towns and
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
cities across the state assuming that
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
they're all buying somehow legal back
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
hose um that their citizens do not know
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
about um the fact of the matter is that
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
a budget is proposed and the voters
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
approve that budget so by the
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
legislature interfering with that after
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
the fact we would actually be negating
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
the will of the voters and I find that
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
um a very frightening Prospect and for
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
that reason I will be opposing this
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
amendment and opposing the Bill thank
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
house well I would take issue with my
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagu definition there um
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
the problem we
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
face is if the will of the
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
voters is to turn down a
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
budget that they feel is
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
excessive then the provisions of I
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
believe it's 2 provides for a default
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
budget which is a fall back
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
position to allow for the town or the
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
school district to continue their good
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
work even though the voters have
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
disagreed with the proposed budget and
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
have turned it down so the default
 
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
have turned it down so the default
budget

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
is my interpretation is a fall back
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
position to allow for the business to
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
continue now what we're
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
facing is that towns and school
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
districts are
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
manipulating the rules on the default
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
budget so then in many
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
cases the default
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
budget rather than being a fallback
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
budget is is actually
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
higher than the the proposed
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
budget so my question is if the voters
 
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
budget so my question is if the voters
turn

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
turn
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
down the de the proposed budget because
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
excessive but the default budget is more
 
00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
than the proposed budget how is is that
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
people thank you further comments
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher actually um
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
just this is a clarification question so
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
I was noticing um we have two separate
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
amendments from representative uh yo
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
here for HB 313 um could uh we just be
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
reminded here 2015 um okay um yeah uh
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the first one then all right got
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
P thank you Mr chairman um I support
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I'll just make two
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
brief comments with regards to online
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
seven by
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
law that those words incurred by law
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it points to something
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's optional
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
that if this
 
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.190 align:start position:0%
that if this
obligation

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
exists it's it's
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
following a law with it's following law
 
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
with regards to a
 
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.390 align:start position:0%
with regards to a
contract

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.990 align:start position:0%
contract
Etc

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
and the also on line seven where it says
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
or mandated by law that that's a mandate
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's something that says this
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
this you must have this so I support
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
this particular Amendment over um
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
2316 and my second comment would be with
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
regards to you know the main idea and
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of this amendment is that it it
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
it speaks to and it has to do with
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
default budgets and in my mind it gives
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
clear Guidance procedurally with regards
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
to these default budgets and it makes
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
complete sense
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
as um my prior colleagues have explained
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
who do support this amendment I don't
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
see that it overrides the will of of the
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
people and I think I believe that the
 
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:12.220 align:start position:0%
issue is is that
 
00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.030 align:start position:0%
issue is is that
[Music]

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
some subdivisions are
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
not are
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
not dealing with the default budget
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
properly and and and this just gives
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
guidance that that these things um shall
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
and when calculating the default budget
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
amendment representative majority thank
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and I I want to uh
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
extend my thanks to representative Kella
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
for for reaching out we did have a good
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
conversation about this and I absolutely
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from and
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
actually when I look at the language
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
that says uh by law um I do reflect on
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
and those of us who are members of
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
Select boards and budget committees in
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
this room and I think a lot of us are
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
are probably going through the process
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
right now of setting your budgets for
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
those SP2 towns and if there were some
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
instance where um the select board were
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
to have proposed a raise for some
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
non-contractual position in town um I
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
could see where that raise would not be
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to go into default and I would
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
think that that might happen and I could
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
see where if this says by law that this
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
would prevent that and I think that
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea um however and with
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
all due respect to my friend um I can't
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
support the amendment because or the uh
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes the amendment because in Long
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
conversations with my finance director
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
he said and I'll use a specific example
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
we have a position in town that is
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
posted for
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
$110,000 if we were to hire that
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
position at say six months in and only
 
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.670 align:start position:0%
position at say six months in and only
pay

00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
$55,000 he would have to default the
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
actual salary and benefits because
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's what it says now I know I think I
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
know what you mean but he would only be
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
able to default what was paid rather
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
than what was budgeted for and defaulted
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
the next year it would auto correct auto
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
correct to whatever was actually paid
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
but in this instance we'd be losing half
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
of the salary that was available and any
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
Del in that salary if there was any
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
would fall to the fund balance which
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
then could be used to offset taxes or
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
other reasons why the select board or or
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
the other reasons why the select board
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
can use it so in in those lengthy
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
conversations I had with my finance
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
director he saw several problems with
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
that language although I see where
 
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.910 align:start position:0%
that language although I see where
you're

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
going thank you Mr chair representative

representative

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
TRV um default default budgets make me
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
crazy let me the member will suspend of
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
course um we've
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
had a conversation multiple times in
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
this committee on how I go
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
about recognizing individuals I guess we
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
need to have it again what I do is I
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
look around the room and I saw your hand
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
before representative trevan but I go
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
from Democrat to Republican to Democrat
 
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.950 align:start position:0%
from Democrat to Republican to Democrat
to

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
Republican you were
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
next as a Democrat after representative
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
majority I looked over to my right
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
because Mr representative kale Hill had
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh had his hand raised he decided not to
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
speak so then I recognized you now
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
chair the configuration of our room
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
makes um anybody sitting in your chair
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh challenged in seeing those of us on
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
your Corners so you know we'll we'll be
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
sure that you notice us um and I know
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
that you do default budgets make me
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
crazy I'm just going to lay that right
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
out there and I do my best to understand
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
them as a member of this committee and a
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
member of the public and I I think I've
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
gotten to a better understanding my
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
issue with this amendment is I have
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
heard several people um on my colleagues
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
on this committee explain that it's
 
00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:42.829 align:start position:0%
on this committee explain that it's
their

00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation or or they ascribe
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
motives to voters or they say in my mind
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
these are notes from when you were
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
speaking and as far as I'm concerned any
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment or Bill that is continuing to
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
be open to your interpretation that you
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
need to explain to me before we even
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
voted into law I can't imagine what will
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
happen if we voted into law so I'm I'm
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't support this it's not
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
clear thank
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
you of you Kell did you have something
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
else thank you
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.870 align:start position:0%
um I think that
the

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
that the um interpretation that the
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
language actual salary and benefits for
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
filled position means that the actual
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
um not reading the plain language of the
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
bill um if if the person let's say in my
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
example before was getting paid
 
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and they left and for um you
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
know on December in December and the new
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
person is hired in January and they've
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
only been working for three months then
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
situation the number would actually not
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
be reflecting that new
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
person's um salary and benefit with that
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation right it would be saying
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
okay 80% of the year we paid $100,000 a
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
year for this position and 20% of the
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
year we paid 75% and so then we're going
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
to add up all of those actual payments
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and that's going to be the default
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
budget I don't believe that that is
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
the um plain language of of refle in the
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
actual salary and benefits of the filled
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
positions the those people agreed um and
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
signed you know employment contract or
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
whatever they agreed to be um paid the
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
$775,000 or or whatever and I believe
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
that the language in this
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
amendment would allow for that agreed
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
payment for their actual um salary
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
to continue I don't believe
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
that that you know if if you um let's
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
say in the example of a firsttime
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
employee you you budgeted at $100,000
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
but you only hired them two days
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
beforehand uh before the public hearing
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
that you're going to only be able to put
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
a default budget of two days of pay that
 
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
I believe that is not um reflecting the
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
actual salary and benefit of the person
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the position right and so that uh it
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the actual reflecting the
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
ACT salary and benefits of um paid for
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
that position right it's the actual
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits of that
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
position and so I just disagree with
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
that that person's interpretation and um
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
so I think the the plain language of the
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
the bill um supports
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
my um conclusion thank
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hollen so at the risk of stating the
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
obvious you don't want to use your
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
default budget the the whole reason that
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
the budget process is so long and
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully transparent is because you
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
actually want to pass your budget and
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
doing things like padding the default
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
budget only adds distrust which
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
undermines the whole process of trying
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
to pass your budget so so most
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities I know would never do
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
that the whole idea is you're trying to
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
convince your community that this is a
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
good idea that it's fiscally responsible
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
both shortterm and long term so when I
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
look at this I agree with what uh
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative maiori said the act the
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
term actual is the problem because the
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
ACT you know an example that we had that
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
we wanted to replace a Parks and Rec
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
director any one of your management
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
positions at the municipal level
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
especially in this hiring climate is
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
going to take multiple months to hire so
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that the actual salary
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
that you did that would be budgeted that
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
was actually paid out would be the same
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
as what you did there the second thing
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
is to uh representative stav's Point
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities already have the
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity if you have that $100,000
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
position and you only fill it with an
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
$80,000 position the unused money then
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
goes into your fund balance which then
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
allows the municipality the flexibility
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
to then give it back to the voters to
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
reduce the tax rate what what this
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
really does is make a really difficult
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
situation any community that is going
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
into default budget is in crisis all of
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
their long-term planning which may be
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
road construction
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh equipment is all
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
thrown off and meanwhile inflation is
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
going along so those items are getting
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
more expensive and so there's a
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
disconnect that's occurring between your
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
community and your governing body and so
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
the real thing that goes forward is not
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
just the focus on the default budget but
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
actually fixing your budget process so
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
that you can actually pass a budget and
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
so this really makes a challenging
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
situation more challenging it takes away
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
the flexibility of the community by
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
stripping their ability to use those
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
those funds uh in a way that is best for
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
the community so so I do not support
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
this I I do not think it's a good
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
lales I would just like like to address
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative howland's statement with
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
concerning uh uh the need for the
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
operating budget and for the community
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
to be in line with the with the uh
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
governing body so that the budget is
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
well known and
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
transparent by the community so that
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
they can pass it now my question is if
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
we have a community that says spending
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
is too high whatever you're doing
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's too much money going in the
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
budget and they make the decision that
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
as a community that we're going to we
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
want to spend less in the form of uh uh
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
government well what do they
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
do if they vote down the budget but the
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
default budget is more than the than the
 
00:48:02.599 --> 00:48:03.870 align:start position:0%
default budget is more than the than the
proposed

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
budget then we just keep going and going
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
and going and the will of the community
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
thwarted representative Howen again so
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
to that point that's why you have
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
elections so obviously if the municipal
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
body is not following the will of the
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
people they would not be elected again
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
so um so they do have a choice I mean it
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
would be the subsequent budget okay if
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
your budget fails and you go into
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
default when you're proposing your next
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
budget if you're sane you're not going
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
to come with a padded budget you're
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
going to try to cut the budget so in the
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent budget that was proposed I
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
would assume it would be a much lower
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
budget and then the voters would vote on
 
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
the much lower budget and that would
 
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
solve your problem so there are
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place to allow those those
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
addressed further comments or
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
questions on the amendment
 
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you Mr chair
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
um I also have problems with the I think
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh follow up on representative howland's
 
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:24.799 align:start position:0%
comments um currently it's is a unique
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
time in several ye over several years
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not the only time that there's
 
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:33.559 align:start position:0%
been a recession or or constraints on
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
how much we can spend because of uh
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
empty positions that we cannot fill for
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
a substantial period of time and uh and
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
I will give you an example we have three
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
department heads and the the they've
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
been vacant for six months and it's
 
00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
because we cannot afford to pay uh what
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
the going rate is for somebody of that
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
skill level level and if we adopt this
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
we will never be able to fill those
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
positions because they will be stagnant
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
at the level that we have right now and
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
I so I can't support this because uh it
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
will make it difficult for uh the
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
town represent your color thank you um I
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
guess reiterating the language of the
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
bill it actually has no effect on on
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
vacant positions um and
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
the uh if the proposed new budget um for
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
let's say a vacant position was um
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
inadequate the budget committee could
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
propose a higher
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
um line item for that that position even
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
though it was vacant um there's nothing
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
in this that
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
would would stop that and actually if
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
the VAC the position was um not filled
 
00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
then it would stay the same amount that
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was approved by the voters the prior
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
time um but it seems like there is um
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
some concern I guess that the
 
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
municipality um is
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
not able
 
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.710 align:start position:0%
not able
to

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh is is going to have trouble dealing
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
with the default budget um
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
that that uh the the town voters decided
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
to give them and I think that is
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
um the town voters have no recourse for
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
affect ing the default budget they can
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
go to the town uh deliberative session
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
they could amend the the the um proposed
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
budget to whatever they choose as long
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
as it's within the um I think it's
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
10% um but they have no recourse for
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
what the amount is of the default budget
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
they cannot make a motion to change the
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
default budget at deliberative session
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
and so what is in the default budget is
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
what is already mandated by law we
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
aren't putting additional burdens on the
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
municipality by saying this is what is
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
to be in the default budget we already
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
mandate that that is that is the section
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
of law that we are currently addressing
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
is it's already required by law that
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
this and not that is in the default
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
budget and the
 
00:52:59.710 --> 00:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
um the lack of clarity between
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities for example if someone um
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
as as someone that is on a b budget
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
committee would agree with um the fact
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
if if the selectman decided to give a
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
raise midyear that was outside of the
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
budget um budgeting process after the
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
budget was passed um and they you know
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
transferred that from another line so
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
that they could give someone a raise
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
that is not part of the default budget
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
and should not be part of the default
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
budget if it is being interpreted by
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
some municipalities that um that that
 
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
raise that they give midyear is an is an
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
obligation based on their reading of
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
this then I think that there needs to be
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
Clarity um for that because that is not
 
00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:49.430 align:start position:0%
Clarity um for that because that is not
the

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of default budgets the default
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
budget is to essentially like uh my
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues said is that the that the
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
functions of the government can the that
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
the town have previously approved can
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
continue and with the language that I am
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
proposing that position that is
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
fulfilling that function of government
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
at X dollar can continue at X dollars
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
not at uh an increased dollar amount
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
that is um not appropriate for
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
fulfilling that function
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
anymore because of the situations on the
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
ground have changed and that position is
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
now being served by a person making that
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
new amount and so I think that that
 
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
reflecting of that in the default budget
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
is appropriate thank you further
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
comments did you have comment
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tetro no you were looking
 
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.549 align:start position:0%
representative Tetro no you were looking
at

00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%

00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
me I'm sorry do you have do you yes
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you can do this in in
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee but seems though we we've
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
heard the same pingpong match here
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
for quite a while and nobody's
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
changed anybody else's mind so I would
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
request no request needed I was getting
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
ready to do what you're G to ask
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
so so seeing no further comments on the
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
amendment uh we'll ask the clerk to call

representative kahill seconds that
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I'll speak to it
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
briefly uh few weeks back um several
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
interested parties uh contacted and
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
suggested some uh new
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
language um that language was discussed
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
back and forth uh several times and
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
after multiple edits it came to uh what
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
you see before you now in uh
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
231h uh basically what this does it's uh
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh a small bit of an an enabling but
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's also uh meant as clarification
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
language um much like another bill that
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sponsoring this year uh where the
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
attorney for the commission says
 
01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
something is allowed but then the
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
individuals going around inspecting or
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
say it's not allowed um that bill will
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
be a clarification bill and I believe as
 
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.670 align:start position:0%
be a clarification bill and I believe as
written

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
this this uh gets the point across that
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford the original
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor was attempting to do basically
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
what it will do is allow
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use pretty much what
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
they would like as long as it's on their
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
class four and class five highways they
 
01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
can still use uniform police officers if
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
they want they can use uh flaggers if
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
they would like again it only applies to
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their class four and
 
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.470 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their class four and
five

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
discussions represent
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
Guth thank you Mr chair what what would
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
happen to communities that don't allow
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
flaggers that they they have determined
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
that any
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh any need for uh for for this kind of
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
service would be provided by police
 
01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.990 align:start position:0%
service would be provided by police
officers

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
if that's a question to me basically
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does it gives the
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
municipality the ability to do pretty
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
much as they see fit does that answer
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
your question yes well I I think it does
 
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman but I every time I see a
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
shell on a
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
local um bill it really concerns me I
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't see why the towns can't do this
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
without the bill and I don't know what
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
the need for it is is if it isn't
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh I read this is if there's a work
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
being done on a street and it's not a
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
heavy traffic
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
Street uh but uh they want particularly
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a a
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
utility uh they they want somebody there
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
we we uh we in our town at least would
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
provide a police officer and under this
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
we don't allow Flags in our town and
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
under this amend it and the bill as I
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
said this is an enabling and clarifying
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
bill it would allow your municipality to
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
continue using police officers so if you
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
choose it would allow the use of uh
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
flaggers under certain SI situations if
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
you choose uh on line nine you'll see it
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
says the use of uni uniform police
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
officers shall that's the only shall in
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
this in this
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
bill um everywhere else there's there's
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
a May and there's a should which are
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
less restrictive the the
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
sh is only required when the
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
municipality has determined and it goes
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
on to list
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
several uh several issues so basically
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's saying under these certain
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances you shall use them but the
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
decision is up to the m the uh
 
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.549 align:start position:0%
decision is up to the m the uh
municipality

01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately I don't mean it that way Mr
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
chairman but thank you you're welcome
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
thank you further question
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and just for clarity for me um
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
if if the if the municipality was
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
challenged their determination do you
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
see where it has to be a a formal
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
written determination that's sent to do
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
or is this the select board determined
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
that according to we need a police
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
officer or the highway department
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
determined that due to these reasons and
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
just have something written do I I see
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
no requirement in there for that I would
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
think that a m
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
municipality uh would have some sort of
 
01:06:35.319 --> 01:06:38.230 align:start position:0%
municipality uh would have some sort of
written

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
uh process or whatever that they would
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
use to determine that this does not
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
mandate that but I would assume any
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
municipality would do that
 
01:06:46.839 --> 01:06:47.870 align:start position:0%
municipality would do that
representative

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so I'm comparing the
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
um the amendment against the original
 
01:06:57.839 --> 01:06:59.470 align:start position:0%
um the amendment against the original
language

01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
um and so I personally do not see the
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
amendment as an improvement over the
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
original um I think the original wording
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
was better um I'm someone who's
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about um police brutality and
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
I think the original wording doesn't
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
does a better job of um restricting the
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
Le the use of police as flaggers and um
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of times when there are
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
instances of police brutality it's from
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
traffic stops which comes from cases
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
like when they're being used as flaggers
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
so um yeah
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
I for for that purpose um yeah I uh um
 
01:07:57.309 --> 01:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
oppose the amendment but support the um
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
underlying bill without it
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
though for the
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
comments I have one more that I forgot
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
to bring up um this was a subject in
 
01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
2015 of a uh Senate Bill 234 that
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
established a commission to actually
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
look a study uh study committee not a
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
commission uh to look at exactly this
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
issue and I just want to read you the
 
01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:21.630 align:start position:0%
issue and I just want to read you the
final

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh it says the committee
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
recommend the bringing forward of
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that would give authority to
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
the municipal governing body to adopt
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances regarding the use of flaggers
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
or police stal details relative to
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
Temporary a traffic control the
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
legislation would limit the use of
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
police to only when specific safety
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
concerns occur or if qualified flaggers
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
are not available so I I believe
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
this the amendment does exactly what
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
that study committee was looking for but
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
