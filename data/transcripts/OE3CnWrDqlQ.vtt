through
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
um the revenues that um
 
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
2022 and 23
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
and to give us sort of an idea as
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
to um where we stand
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
and um the differences i guess between
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
what the governor is recommending
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
and what we passed on the house floor
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
on thursday of last week
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i hope everyone received the email
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
and the information that uh
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
mickey sent it was three pages so it's
 
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.670 align:start position:0%
mickey sent it was three pages so it's
not

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
a great deal but we're going to look at
 
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.110 align:start position:0%
a great deal but we're going to look at
education

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund the highway fund
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
and hb2
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh fish and game basically was the same
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
as the governor's budget
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
so we really have no um
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
need to go through that
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
with uh today so um
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
anyhow i'll turn it over to uh mr
 
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.070 align:start position:0%
anyhow i'll turn it over to uh mr
landrigan

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
landrigan
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
and if you have questions as we're going
 
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.830 align:start position:0%
and if you have questions as we're going
through

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
please just um raise your hand and we'll
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
call on you so mickey if you would go
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
ahead please
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
sure do you have a preference where we
 
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
start representative it doesn't
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter so what's probably
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
going to happen for a big picture
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if we want to talk general
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
and education
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
combined surplus statement mike kane is
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to be working on that
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
and we'll do something as a full
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
committee likely at some point soon
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
to go over that today we can discuss and
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
i've got documents here for you that
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
kind of break out just the education
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
trust fund because that usually falls
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
just on division two
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the highway fund and then
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
i did pluck um some of the subject
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
matter from the
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 the trailer built draft
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
that we got a couple weeks ago
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
um we'll speak more about that when we
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
get to us so
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe right now we'll start with um
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
we'll start with the education trust
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
fund document
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
and um just a reminder this these
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
documents are online
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
on our budget document page in the
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
division 2 specific page so
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
if the public is looking for them they
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
are available online right now
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
all right so can you can you all see
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
this document
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
mickey can you expand that a little bit
 
00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:16.390 align:start position:0%
mickey can you expand that a little bit
yep

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
i can uh kind of zoom in and we'll work
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
our way down
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
so this format should be pretty familiar
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
to everybody it's essentially just that
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
that basic surplus statement type look
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
starting with the beginning balance of
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
uh and ending with what the projected
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
balance would be based on these budget
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
components at the end of fiscal 23. so
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund starting
 
00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:44.150 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund starting
pretty

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
close to zero we're going to start with
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
a deficit balance of 3.2 million to
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
begin this fiscal year that we're
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
um we've plugged in the house based
 
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.390 align:start position:0%
um we've plugged in the house based
revenues

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
up top um and
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
the adjustments as well starting here on
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
line 15 through 21
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
as you know combined education and uh
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
highway fun excuse me education and
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
general fund the
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
revenues were about 80 million dollars
 
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
revenues were about 80 million dollars
less

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
the house weighs and means in the house
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
adopted revenues than um
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh the governors and the breakout of
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
that is approximately 50 million of it
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
was in the education trust fund and 30
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
was attributable to the general fund so
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
the base revenues
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
and there is a complicated split with
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
some of these business taxes for
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
instance get split between the general
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
fund and education trust fund
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's not an across the board for each
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
revenue source if at a later time we
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to dive into that
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
we could i do have a document i could
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
send all of you just so at least you
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
have a reference if you're curious which
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
revenue source and how it gets split
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'll send that to the committee so
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
you've got that on hand
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
that would that would be helpful okay uh
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
mickey are the um the business profit
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
and the bet are those based on the
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
governor's reductions
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
or are they based on current
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
law that is a good question so when we
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
talk about base revenues
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
those are current law so everything from
 
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
those are current law so everything from
line

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
4 to 12 these are all revenue estimates
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
based on current law
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
if we jump down to line 16
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
or it's really 17 and 18
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
19 20 these are the adjustments
 
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.630 align:start position:0%
19 20 these are the adjustments
necessary

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
for the proposed changes in the taxes
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
that we should see in house bill 2 when
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yep so um
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
so just for quick reference the revenue
 
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.110 align:start position:0%
so just for quick reference the revenue
adjustments

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
that are in the governor's recommended
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
budget now total about 18 million
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
dollars over the biennium
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to start right at the
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
beginning we'll just flow right through
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
this entire document
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
so starting with our negative 3.2
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
million dollar balance
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to take our base revenues
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
the folks who have been on division two
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
in the past will remember
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
in the last budget there was a pretty
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
significant surplus in the education
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
and one of the decisions made by budget
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
writers at the time
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
was to allocate 62 and a half million
 
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.110 align:start position:0%
was to allocate 62 and a half million
dollars

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 19 put it aside in a
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
restricted account
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
within the education trust fund knowing
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
it was going to be spent
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
as part of that one-time education
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
revenue or excuse me education fund
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
grants in fiscal 21.
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
so this line 16 when you see the 62.5
 
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.670 align:start position:0%
so this line 16 when you see the 62.5
million

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
additional uh designated for education
 
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:42.949 align:start position:0%
additional uh designated for education
aid

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
that's really just using that money
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's been sitting set aside for this
 
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%
that's been sitting set aside for this
year

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to skip down if you
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
look at line 27 you'll see the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
expenditure of it so the
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's really a net zero what's going on
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
this year that was revenue
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
that was collected a couple years ago
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
and set aside to be spent this year
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
so the only revenue adjustment that we
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
have for fiscal 21
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
is just that 62.5
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
million make made available from that
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
designated pond
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
so all told base revenues and that 62.5
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
million dollars is an anticipated
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
addition of
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
1.1 billion dollars in fiscal 21 to the
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so spending appropriations we've got
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
adequacy charter schools
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
the other state aid programs school
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
special ed aid we'll get into those this
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
current budget was the first time those
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
other state programs were pulled into
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
and this was also something that budget
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
writers recognized last year as with the
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
surplus in the education trust fund this
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
was an opportunity to fund those
 
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
was an opportunity to fund those
programs

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
with it rather than with general fund
 
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.150 align:start position:0%
with it rather than with general fund
dollars

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
so the numbers that you see here
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
starting with lines 26 through 33
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
for all three years um this is what's
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
appropriated so this is what's in house
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
bill 1
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
or house bill 3 technically now for
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 because we had house bill 3
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
and 4
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
this year and then looking ahead at 22
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 and fiscal 23
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
these are the appropriation levels at
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget so
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
those are plugged in there now so you
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
know your starting point
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
as a division obviously as you make
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
changes to any line items in these
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
in this fund we would adjust the surplus
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
statement accordingly
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh mickey uh mary has uh representative
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
heath has a question
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um mickey um
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
these are a done deal no
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
deductions can be made for this this is
 
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.710 align:start position:0%
deductions can be made for this this is
already

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
in statute so this is stays as is am i
 
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.310 align:start position:0%
in statute so this is stays as is am i
correct

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 21 yes yep yep so
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
um first so i i don't know if the
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
governor's house bill two
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't really see anything in the
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
draft i'm not sure because i i'd have to
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
double check but i believe we did for
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
the biennium only
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
that ended this year so if the idea is
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
funding these programs from the
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
a house bill 2 section will be necessary
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
if for whatever reason that's not in the
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
i would consider that like a technical
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
thing that the division division 2 could
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
square up
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned all of these programs
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is these amounts here in fiscal 21
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
um represent what was appropriated in
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
on line 35 we we generally don't budget
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
an education trust fund lapse so when we
 
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:35.910 align:start position:0%
an education trust fund lapse so when we
set

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
um when we set the budget for every two
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
years for the education trust fund
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
we appropriate at a level that we think
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
are the best estimates of what is the
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
actual expenditure going to be
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
so there's no anticipated laps because
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
really if everything goes well you're
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
going to spend it pretty close to what
 
00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:52.550 align:start position:0%
going to spend it pretty close to what
you

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
what you expected we have learned
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
that in fiscal 21 there's going to be
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
about a 16.4 million dollar
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
laps on expended appropriations and as
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know these programs
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
specifically this is related to adequacy
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
and charter schools
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
um as enrollments change obviously the
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
amount that the state pays changes
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
so between uh adequacy charter schools
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
and there might be a little bit based on
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
the uh school building aid
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was put out there's
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
gonna be 16.4 million dollars of
 
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.509 align:start position:0%
gonna be 16.4 million dollars of
unexpected

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
unexpected
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
appropriations this year so that's why
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
you see that represented
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
as a positive here versus the
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
appropriations negative so that's
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
essentially going to help your bottom
 
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.150 align:start position:0%
essentially going to help your bottom
line

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
so all told on line 38 you'll see that
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
the current year balance for the
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
3.1 million which means revenues over
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated expenditures uh positive 3.1
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
when you net that against our starting
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
balance of
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
negative 3.2 it gets to a 98 000
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
deficit and what is done generally
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
is the comptroller's office will
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
true up the education trust fund in the
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
case of a deficit
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
with a general fund transfer so this
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
budget picture includes a 98 000
 
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:13.990 align:start position:0%
budget picture includes a 98 000
transfer

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
from general funds to um
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
get to an ending balance in the
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
i'll pause there to see if we have any
 
00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:29.509 align:start position:0%
i'll pause there to see if we have any
questions

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:32.949 align:start position:0%
 
mickey

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
so special education tuition
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
transportation school building aid
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
were all put in
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund in 18.
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh uh 20 and 21. so it was the 19th
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
session yeah
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah 19. okay so
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
unl if those are not currently
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
continued in hb2
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
then those in fact could come out of
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
there is that what you're suggesting
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's up to you there's no there's
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
nothing outside of statutory change that
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
decides how those programs are paid
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
so if the committee and when you develop
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
a budget you would like
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
those programs to be general funded we
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
can just switch the appropriation and
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
the budget to general fund and make sure
 
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:23.910 align:start position:0%
the budget to general fund and make sure
this

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
the um the statute ties to that decision
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
or vice versa if you want to have
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
everything in the education trust fund
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
or even a combination of you know so
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
as being responsible for house bill 1
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
and 2 you've got the flexibility to do
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
what you want with those programs the
 
00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.470 align:start position:0%
what you want with those programs the
only

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
above statute if you will um restriction
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
on anything here is lottery revenue
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
so way up top that 120 million 120 527
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
by the constitution that revenue needs
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
to go to schools so
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
everything else my understanding would
 
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
everything else my understanding would
be

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
up to you in house bill 2 and house bill
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
1 how you want to
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
position your budget
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative heath you had a question
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
more of a comment
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
um in the last budget cycle the reason
 
00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:12.390 align:start position:0%
um in the last budget cycle the reason
why

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
we took special ed tnt and school
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
and brought it into the trust was
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
because we had
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
those funds and then we could um release
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
general fund funds um to give more
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
flexibility to some of the other
 
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
flexibility to some of the other
divisions

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
but it worked out well because it's it's
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
education oriented so it worked within
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
the context of the law
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
so um i thought it was a good move at
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
and um made good use of the funds thank
 
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.830 align:start position:0%
and um made good use of the funds thank
you

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative murray yeah thank you
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a dumb question
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh mickey what are the numbers that you
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
use to get the 98 million or is it 98
 
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
use to get the 98 million or is it 98
000.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
what are those two lines so the 98 000
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
just represents the amount needed from
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
to finish on that next line of zero so
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
which lines did you use to get that is
 
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
which lines did you use to get that is
that

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
so it's essentially your beginning
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
balance so the 3.207
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's a negative but then you had a
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
positive year the net of those two
 
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.549 align:start position:0%
positive year the net of those two
amounts

00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
is 98 000 can you give me the line
 
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
is 98 000 can you give me the line
numbers

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's a line one and
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
38 shouldn't that to 98 000.
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um mickey i
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
had a i had a phone call i had to take
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
the minute you started this so let me i
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that i
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
understand where we're going here you
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
started with um
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
revenues you started with fiscal year 21
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and you went through revenues
 
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
and then i and then appropriate
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then um revenue revenue adjustments
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
and then appropriations i came in
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes someplace in within
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
appropriations that
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
did i miss anything that i need to know
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
um i was just discussing representative
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
bucco that
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
so once we've got our revenues estimated
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
for the year we're gonna
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
apply the appropriations that were made
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
these rows 26
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
through 33 are what was actually
 
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.710 align:start position:0%
through 33 are what was actually
budgeted

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
and then on line 35 we anticipate this
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
year 16.4 million of it
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
won't will lapse won't be spent just
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
because of the actual data of students
 
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.390 align:start position:0%
because of the actual data of students
being

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the formulas for the aid programs
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
which gets you down to a
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
positive year of 3.109 million
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
when you apply that to the negative
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
starting position we still need 98 000
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
from the general fund to get to a zero
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
so i'll move on to fiscal 22 and 23
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
which is our upcoming biennium
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned the 98 000 would bring
 
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:02.870 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned the 98 000 would bring
the

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
balance of the fund to zero so we're
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
going to start fiscal 22 with a zero
 
00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:07.909 align:start position:0%
going to start fiscal 22 with a zero
balance

00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
now we're going to apply our base
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
revenues just over a billion dollars
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna now see these revenue
 
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:16.870 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna now see these revenue
adjustments

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
based on the governor's proposed changes
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we will see in house bill
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
2. um in fiscal
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
20 uh two in total it's 5.6 million
 
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.510 align:start position:0%
20 uh two in total it's 5.6 million
dollars

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
which gets your net available revenues
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
estimated for fiscal 22 in the education
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund to
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
moving on to the appropriations so this
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
document now just has plugged in
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
what you see in the governor's budget
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
bill the recommended budget
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
so adequacy set at 940 million charter
 
00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:53.190 align:start position:0%
so adequacy set at 940 million charter
schools

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
just under 47 million the low and
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
moderate income
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh homeowners program 800 000 a year
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
special education aid and tuition and
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
transportation set at the same levels as
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
and then for school building aid the
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
amount funded my understanding is just
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
the tail payments and there was no
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
funding in there for new traditional
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
school building aid projects
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
these programs everything i just
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the exception of the low
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
and moderate
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
um homeowners program um the department
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
will be in with us
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
on um a wednesday to discuss these in
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
more detail so
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
there was a slight tweak proposed
 
00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:33.270 align:start position:0%
there was a slight tweak proposed
adequacy

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
related to free and reduced lunch
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
enrollments we'll see that in house bill
 
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.230 align:start position:0%
enrollments we'll see that in house bill
2.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
2.
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
and then i don't think there was any law
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
changes relative to the other programs
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
but the department will be able to walk
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
us through
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
where those numbers are how they were
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
derived and what they will serve what
 
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.149 align:start position:0%
derived and what they will serve what
the

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh mickey oh i see lots of hands up okay
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
mary you're you seem to be at the top of
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
the screen so go ahead
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you oh it was my phone i'm sorry
 
00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:05.430 align:start position:0%
thank you oh it was my phone i'm sorry

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know what why don't you take
 
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else and let my phone
 
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
somebody else and let my phone
[Music]

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair um mickey
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
can i just ask him
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
um i see on line 27
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
that there is no appropriation or
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
proposed appropriation
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
for the next two fiscal years
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
for additional education aid can you
 
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.630 align:start position:0%
for additional education aid can you
just

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
kind of explain to me what that what
 
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.230 align:start position:0%
kind of explain to me what that what
that

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
was and why it's not being proposed now
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
what i'm not sure i understand
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
sure um we'll get way more into the
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
education funding formula
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
probably wednesday morning definitely
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
wednesday morning but essentially what
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
happened was
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
budget writers in the last biennium
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
set the education funding payments in
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
to also include uh fiscal capacity
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
disparity aid as well as some enhanced
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
aid relative to free and reduced lunch
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
student populations um that was
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislated to repeal
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh june 30 of this year
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
so that was intended that was put in law
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
just to apply for one year
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
um all right you know can i have a
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
certainly okay thank you you know just
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
just one question
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
am i understanding from what you just
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
said then that there is already
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
in the in line 26 the adequate education
 
00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:31.669 align:start position:0%
in the in line 26 the adequate education
aid

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
there is already some adjustment
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch is that
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
and rather than yep rather than it being
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
a new aid component
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be a requirement for
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
the department of education to use a
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
different adma
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
figure when calculating regular adequacy
 
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.350 align:start position:0%
figure when calculating regular adequacy
so

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
um i maybe could have broken
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
some of that portion out the the amount
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
attributable to doing that on this line
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
or maybe created another row but
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
we can work with the committee and i'll
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
work with the department and we can
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
break out the aid components for all
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
three years if that's useful for the
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
committee as we move forward
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
oh thank you and i apologize for my
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
phone ringing my granddaughter is sick
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
in florida and she's
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
upset um my question is mickey
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and i think probably you just said
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
you were going to do this
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
can you give us um the amount of money
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate appropriated for
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
2021 minus disparity
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
the special money that was put in and
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
the total amount that in the governor's
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
budget that's been budgeted
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
um could is that any place that we can
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
look at or could you do that
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's essentially row 26 on this
 
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.710 align:start position:0%
that's essentially row 26 on this
document

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
so the additional disparity in frame
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
is included on row 27. okay perfect
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
but like i said we're gonna dive way
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
into this on wednesday with the
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
department and they'll
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'll reach out to them ahead of
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
time just so we've got all this on hand
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
for wednesday
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you uh so mickey i guess
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
a related question but on line 28 shows
 
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:29.830 align:start position:0%
a related question but on line 28 shows
that

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
for the current year it's 1 billion 24
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
million for
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
um adequate education
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then and then the 939 million and
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
the 946 million for 22 and 23 represents
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
about a 70 million dollar uh what
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
cut from the the 21
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
the 1 billion from 21 is that about
 
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
the 1 billion from 21 is that about
right

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh i mean yes that's the difference
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
between the two years
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
um the governor funded essentially the
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
ed funding at the current law
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
with just a little bit of a tweak to the
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
adm formula
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
um so if you want to look at total
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
dollars you can see the decrease from
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
year to year
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
there's also quite a bit going on with
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
enrollments too and you've heard that
 
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
enrollments too and you've heard that
testimony

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
um just with what's going on with the
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
anti the
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
projected adms for this coming year
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
which was used as a base for calculating
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
these amounts for 22 and 23
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
um but again we're we're going to get
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
way more into this wednesday
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
and but that's essentially what's going
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
on with that
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative petrie
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair uh
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
on the uh the hr 11 the ways and means
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
estimates how do that how does that
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
reconcile what we have here
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
so um going way up to
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
the base revenues so in the
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
education trust and this document here
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative is just education trust
 
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.230 align:start position:0%
representative is just education trust
fund

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
50 million less than the governor's base
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
revenues so this document here
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
and if i jump over to the governor's
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
so this is the governor's surplus
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
statement so the governor had
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
anticipated the education trust fund
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
ending with a positive balance of 32
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
32.2 million dollars at the end of
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23. right now with the house's
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
revenues plugged in and everything else
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
kept the same mind you
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
it's anticipated to be about an 18
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
million dollar need for general fund
 
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
million dollar need for general fund
support

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
so versus 32.2 plus or 18
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
negative that's about your 50 million
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
dollar difference in revenues
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
there there's also a difference in the
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
those house
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
revenues on the general fund side i
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
don't have that on here that's about
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
another 30 million or close to
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
and like i said mr kane in our office is
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
probably going to do something higher
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
level with a combined general education
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
surplus picture for the committee
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
chair just one more question i'm sorry
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
is it within our authority school
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
districts across the state are
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
just beside themselves because of the
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
october one um
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
count student counts for in relation to
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
um student counts and then the freedom
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch because
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
they're not coming in at all is it
 
00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
they're not coming in at all is it
within

00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
our authority to hold them harmless
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
with um school numbers from 2020
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
instead of the 21 school year
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh yes i mean that that's you can direct
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
through legislation what you want the
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
department of education to use either
 
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.630 align:start position:0%
department of education to use either
for

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
um inputs or just a flat out you know
 
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.070 align:start position:0%
um inputs or just a flat out you know
it's

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
referred to as a whole harmless
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes just a flat funding at a
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
dollar level
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
we can legislate anything in house bill
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
2 related to
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
how much gets paid for education funding
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
the only thing about that and i would
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
defer to the department is
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
challenges relative to timing and local
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
budgets and all that you know and how
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
the state aid works so
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
the technical aspect of it is another
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
thing but um
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
from a state perspective to expend those
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
dollars yes that's that's in the context
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
of one and two the house bill one and
 
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.630 align:start position:0%
of one and two the house bill one and
two

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
so follow up madam chair yes go ahead
 
00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:28.549 align:start position:0%
so follow up madam chair yes go ahead
please

00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
so the only way that we could help
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
because they're doing their budgets
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
basically right now in town meetings and
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
so the only way that we actually the
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
finance committee could actually
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
well maybe there isn't a way we could
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
actually help them it would have to be a
 
00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:44.630 align:start position:0%
actually help them it would have to be a
bill

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
that was sent to us like the one that's
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
coming from the senate
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
that we would have to move along quickly
 
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:51.590 align:start position:0%
that we would have to move along quickly
um

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
and get authorized and then get that
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
over to the governor's desk that's the
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
only way that
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
actually we could help them with that
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the the fiscal year that they need
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
um possibly i i mean i i the timeline of
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
house bill one and two you're talking
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
end of june effective for one july
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
right so if the idea would be to
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
authorize that money
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
officially sooner than that so districts
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
could plan and budget
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah you would need a piece of
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
legislation sooner than the timeline of
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
i if if in fact that went
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
into hb2 even though
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
the school district may not
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
know what they're getting they could in
 
00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:46.149 align:start position:0%
know what they're getting they could in
fact

00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
just simply accept that money
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be done now
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know when when uh when the
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
distribution is made
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
in uh the three times a year
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
that um they they accept the money it's
 
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.310 align:start position:0%
that um they they accept the money it's
not

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's not hard and fast as to um
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
what we what we put in and i would
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
personally prefer that whatever occurs
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
would be in hb2 and
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
you know we have to we have to send a
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
balanced budget over to the senate
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
and so uh if we decide to put
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
more money into adequate education aid
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
then we have to take it from someplace
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
else within the um
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so it's going to be
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
a balancing act
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
for us as to what
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
what do we want to support
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it may be best at this
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
obviously hear what doe has to say but
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
to leave whatever the adequate education
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
is and then press for the senate
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
to increase it based on their
 
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
to increase it based on their
projections

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
projections
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
of what's coming i i mean i was
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
i was flabbergasted that
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
this is what the ways and means
 
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.509 align:start position:0%
this is what the ways and means
committee

00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
unanimously put forward to us
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
so it's you know it's obviously
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
what you know it's like any compromise
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
is what you can get through and
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
so i was not part of the ways and means
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
discussion so i don't
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
have any idea who did what to whom but
 
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:50.789 align:start position:0%
have any idea who did what to whom but
uh

00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
but that's that's just my feeling um
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh mickey i do want to ask um
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
about this 62-5 was that
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
targeted to something special yep
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that was the initial estimates of the
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
time of the total related to
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity disparity aid and
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
the additional free and reduced lunch so
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
the one-time money
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
that was the estimate of what it was
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
going to be was 62-5 so that's why that
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
was put aside two years ago with the
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
anticipation that was going to be the
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
amount paid out in
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
contributing to some of that 16.4
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
million laps just because of what
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
happened with
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
enrollments and you know we make
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
estimates two years out for head funding
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
which is difficult so it ended up being
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
less than 625 all told which is why some
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
of that was freed up
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
in that 62. 16.4 million laps
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay so that lapse stays within the
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is that correct
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
correct yep that's entirely that
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
restricted money it said any unexpended
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
portion would go back to the education
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund that's the way it was written
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay now i know we're going to get into
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
the hb2 stuff
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
but the governor did say
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
that we would use the free and reduced
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
lunch numbers from
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
was it 2019
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i think i'm going to hold off on
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
speaking to the details of house bill 2
 
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.349 align:start position:0%
speaking to the details of house bill 2
because

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
like like you all i think i've seen an
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
early draft not sure what's going to
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
change but i can tell you the the
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
numbers and the backup to calculating
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
made a an adjustment to the free reduced
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
lunch numbers to bring them up
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it was entirely back to
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
what the numbers were in fiscal 20 i
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
think there's a formula that's going to
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
be proposed
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to bring those numbers up
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll get into that
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
definitely when we get house bill 2 but
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get into that with more
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
detail wednesday as well with the
 
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
detail wednesday as well with the
department

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
i just don't want to say it is one way
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
and then we get house bill 2 and it's
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
slightly different than that you know
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's my whole concern
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i i understand that um
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
all right let's go on to uh 23
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
well 22 and 23 which are
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
which are not looking too good
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
so to finish up fiscal 22 here if you
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
look at line 34
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget proposes
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
transferring 15 million dollars a year
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
to the public school infrastructure fund
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
all of you may be familiar with this it
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
was in somewhat of a wind down mode
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was funded with some state surplus
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a couple of times over the years
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
provided many grants across the state to
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
and the governor's budget proposes 15
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars in each fiscal 22 and 23
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
to that fund so taking into
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
consideration all the revenues revenue
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments and anticipated expenditures
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
the current year balance for fiscal 22
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
ends with a 2.6 million
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
deficit which would require on line 40
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
you see a transfer in
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
from the general fund of 2.6 million
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to get back to a zero
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh balance again so i put on the very
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
bottom here accumulative general fund
 
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.430 align:start position:0%
bottom here accumulative general fund
support

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
so just so you know so remember we took
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
we needed 98 000
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
last year add the 2.6 million dollars
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
this year now we're up to 2.7 this
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
budget proposal
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
to this point needs 2.7 million dollars
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
from the general fund to balance the
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
not a whole lot difference 22 or excuse
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
me 23 is essentially the same story as
 
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.470 align:start position:0%
me 23 is essentially the same story as
22.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
we've got your base revenues you've got
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
your revenue adjustments
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
second year of these tax changes have a
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
little bit bigger of an impact
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
so you see the adjustments on line 22 go
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
from 5.6 million negative
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
last year to 12 million dollars in
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23.
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
to get to a 10.06 billion
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
total revenue and 23. here we've got our
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
um education funding programs
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
the 15 million dollars this year to this
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 ends with a negative balance
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
of close to 16 million dollars
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
transfer in that from the general fund
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
back to a zero balance
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
add that nearly 16 to the previous 2.7
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
all told the general fund would chip in
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
18 and a half million dollars
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
in this budget proposal to balance the
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
and that's where we're at that's your
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
starting point essentially
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
in division two when it comes to
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so in the revenues with the
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're losing about 61 million dollars
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 22 22 to 23 i'm looking at
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
line 23. so the only thing there is i
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
would caution is
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
that 62 and a half million dollars
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't really revenue of fiscal 21
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
that was just that set aside money that
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
we pulled in to spend in 21.
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
so if you back out that 62 and a half
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars on line 16
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
your revenues actually are really flat
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
they you know
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
if you just look at your base revenue in
 
00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.030 align:start position:0%
if you just look at your base revenue in
21

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
because it'll back it won't include that
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
625 it's 1.065 billion
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
and then if we jump down here after
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments you're almost
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
right on the money i see you know so
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's pretty flat if you just
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
ignore that set-aside money that we
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
pulled back in so there's a six million
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
from 22 to 23.
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um mickey i
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
wonder i i i want to make sure that i'm
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
understanding something that the
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe this is something we're
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to talk about
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
more on wednesday but the um
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh the um the transfers to the
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh starting line uh 25 those projections
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
is i know that i think representative
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
heath mates
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
was concerned about using the october
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
i guess last year numbers first for
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
student enrollments and i
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
i i guess what i'm i i guess i wanted to
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
explore that a little bit more
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
um i i'm not sure i understand what the
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
problem is with using those numbers and
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
and if if part of the problem is that
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know that was during the sort of
 
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
you know that was during the sort of
covid

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
during the middle of covid i guess what
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering is
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
that you know to the extent that those
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
reflect a a
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
um a drop in student population
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
is it out of line with the drop
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
that i as i understand it has been going
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
on for several years in other words is
 
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.309 align:start position:0%
on for several years in other words is
there

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
a precipitous drop last year that
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
um you know that is much higher than it
 
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
um you know that is much higher than it
was

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
from uh from the it going back you know
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
several bienniums
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um total
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
enrollments have been
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
on the decline which is naturally since
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
ed funding is a per capita program it
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
has naturally just decreased the total
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants statewide um
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
from what the department put out there
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
for estimates for this coming year were
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
significantly less than that trend
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
and they were pandemic related both in
 
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.430 align:start position:0%
and they were pandemic related both in
base

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
base
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
total number of students and then as
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
well for
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch populations so
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblut was speaking to
 
00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:36.630 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblut was speaking to
this

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
last week with us um you know this
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
students who are eligible for free and
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch population identified as
 
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.430 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch population identified as
so

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what drives the state
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
formula so um
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
lunch was provided meals were provided
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
in my understanding to all students
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
qualification in that regard so it
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
really sent a decline in the number of
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
students who were identified as eligible
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch meals which
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's the data set that the department
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
uses for calculating grants and that's
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
they're bound by that in law which is
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
why there's been a couple bills this
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
session to
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
modify the data set that the department
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
of education would use to calculate
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
grants for the next two years
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know recognizing that some of the
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
data may
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
have been impacted because of the
 
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
have been impacted because of the
pandemic

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
yes just to comment um
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
to um respond also to representative
 
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.670 align:start position:0%
to um respond also to representative
lynn

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
lynn
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
all those dollars and and um the
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblut talked a little
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
bit about this too
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers that have been driven
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the the lower number uh based
 
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:48.870 align:start position:0%
and the the lower number uh based
directly

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic have a huge
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
impact all across the board because not
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
only does it
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
impact the amount of money that school
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
districts get it ultimately
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
impacts greatly the number of federal
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
funds that we get new hampshire already
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
gets small state minimums
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
but the the money that comes into
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is driven by those free
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
and reduced
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
numbers so it's critical how we look at
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
those and
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's why getting those numbers to
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
what they really are is critically
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
on the education trust fund
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay mickey you have
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
provided us with a lot of food for
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
thought here
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
and uh if this isn't bad enough
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm really excited to go to the
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
highway fund and this one is going to be
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
really difficult for us because
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
so much money is
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
goes to uh goes to safety
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
and so we have to make sure as we're
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking through this
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
that we're able to balance what
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
safety uses and what
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
highway uses so i will let you start
 
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.230 align:start position:0%
highway uses so i will let you start
mickey

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
all right so similar format
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund document so
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
all this should flow
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
um in the same way so i'm going to
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
go through it a little bit quicker but
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
raise your hand stop me interrupt me if
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going too fast
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
so house-based revenue estimates when it
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
comes to the highway fund we're talking
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
unrestricted road toll which is also
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
referred to as the gas tax
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
and then all your unrestricted revenue
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
relative to motor vehicle fees and fines
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
all collected by safety um
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
these estimates my understanding are the
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
agency estimates that were adopted by
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
house ways and means
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh which were over the three years
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
about six million dollars 6.2 i believe
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
less than the governor's estimates
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
your nexus from where the governor's
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
budget was to where you're starting
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
so starting with fiscal 21
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
we started with a budgetary balance of
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
nearly 64 million dollars
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
ways and means estimates are 238 million
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
for the year then if you recall
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
and and folks who have been on the
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
division before remember this
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
the department of safety has highway
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
fund appropriations in two different
 
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.069 align:start position:0%
fund appropriations in two different
ways

00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
really one of them is just straight
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
highway funds which most of them
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
reside in the division of state police
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
when you pull up their budget you will
 
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.069 align:start position:0%
when you pull up their budget you will
see

00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
highway funds and it's clear in the
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
um there's all those accounts most of
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
those accounts are funded with
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
agency income which is really the
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
cost related to collecting and
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
administering highway
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
fund revenue and this is something
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's in statute and in the
 
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.069 align:start position:0%
that's in statute and in the
constitution

00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
that directs the department of safety to
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
net off the cost that it takes them to
 
00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:22.710 align:start position:0%
net off the cost that it takes them to
collect

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
the revenues from these different
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
sources and then remit the difference to
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
so the revenue adjustments that we have
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
here on line 10
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
this is how much the department of
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
safety is
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the areas of cost of
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
collecting and administering
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
highway fund revenue
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
we assume they're not going to spend
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
every nickel that we appropriate in the
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
budget so that we we
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
account for a lapse there on line 12 is
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
your net
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
impact of essentially the division of
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and some indirect costs at
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with collecting and
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
administering highway fund revenue so
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's about 30 million dollars a year
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
so we take this 30 million dollars off
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
the the gross revenue of the
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
238.3 gets to about 208 million dollars
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
of net revenue to the highway fund in
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
everyone's still with me on that because
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
cost of collections can be a little
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
tricky okay appropriations
 
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.230 align:start position:0%
tricky okay appropriations
transfers

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
three departments in the current budget
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
have direct highway fund appropriations
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
department of transportation department
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
of safety and then the judicial branch
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
transportation is the lion's share of it
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
most of it resides in operations
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
and local aid in the the block grant
 
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.710 align:start position:0%
and local aid in the the block grant
line

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
department of safety most of that like i
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
said is in state police
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we can get breakdowns and you've
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
actually got some of the breakdowns and
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
some of the documents that agencies have
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
given you as far as specifics in the
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
as far as which divisions and accounting
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
units that they're budgeted in
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then judicial branch has for
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
before my time always had a two million
 
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.950 align:start position:0%
before my time always had a two million
dollar

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
highway fund appropriation to subsidize
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
their general fund budget and it's
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
always been the same amount
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
i think the nexus is they adjudicate
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
um traffic related cases so the highway
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
fund supports the judicial branch and
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's the two million dollars there you
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
on line 21 the governor's recommended
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.109 align:start position:0%
on line 21 the governor's recommended
budget

00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
assumed that in fiscal 21 that there
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh a nine million dollar need for the
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
department of transportation relative to
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance to pull from the
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
highway fund surplus
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
to date only four and a half million has
 
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:45.670 align:start position:0%
to date only four and a half million has
been

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
brought through fiscal and approved the
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
remaining 4.5 million
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think is just anticipating they could
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
need more by the end of this year
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
so this could be something that we would
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
want to monitor
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
for the next couple of months because if
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's deemed that
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
they don't come back for another draw
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
the winter just we have spring tomorrow
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
and it's great
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
or you know maybe they need more than
 
00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
or you know maybe they need more than
nine

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'd say the number on line 21 is a fluid
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
number at this point so we'll monitor
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
that to see
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
how much more or less the department
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
will need to fund winter operations for
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
we've got on line 22 this is merely just
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
an accounting
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
action related to some revenue that
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know it gets dispersed other funds
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
mostly related to the
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
unrefunded road toll so this is like the
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
gas tax that folks pay for fuel that
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
goes into their
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
boat or lawnmower is my understanding so
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's credit back for the tax on that
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
so this this line 22
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
is really just an accounting uh line
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
and then just like the other funds on
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
line 23 we assume elapse
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
if you see why uh fiscal 21
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
is much higher than 22 and 23. and you
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
heard some of this when the department
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
some of their spending was down there
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
was some direction to limit some
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
spending a little bit for fiscal 21
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is a lot of work has
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
gone into these lapse numbers and
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
formulating what they are
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think if you wanted to explore those
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
more with the department they could
 
00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
more with the department they could
speak

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
more to them but i think at this point
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the lapse is at a place that the
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the departments
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
are comfortable with but it's certainly
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
something you can
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
discuss with them if you'd like to so
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
taking those
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments off of the 266 million
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation from
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
the operating budget gets down to a 248
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
million dollar net draw
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
and if you remember our revenue this
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
year was only 208
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
which means in fiscal 20 um 21 there's a
 
00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:52.790 align:start position:0%
which means in fiscal 20 um 21 there's a
negative

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
negative
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
nearly 40 million dollars and that would
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
essentially come from that carry forward
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
highway fund we try to balance on a gap
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
basis so
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
we recognize at the end of every fiscal
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
year there's some payables some
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
liabilities some accounting
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments that need to be made these
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
numbers came from the comptroller's
 
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
numbers came from the comptroller's
office

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't really see much of a need to
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
explore those further we can if you'd
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
like we can we can uh
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
we can dive into those usually we don't
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
so once you take into consideration gap
 
00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:25.030 align:start position:0%
so once you take into consideration gap
adjustments

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
this year is anticipated and with a
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
do you have questions at this point or
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
can i want to move on
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh mickey
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
with a negative balance
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the overall effect of
 
00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:48.829 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the overall effect of
that

00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
and it's one i've asked before too um
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
essentially there's i think one of the
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
biggest concerns is that it could just
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
affect bond ratings you know that the
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
fund is
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
in a negative position you know on an
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
accrual basis
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
um i think if i shared anything more
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
than that it would be
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
not super informed so if that is
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
something we want to explore
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
we should reach out to the comptroller's
 
00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:16.390 align:start position:0%
we should reach out to the comptroller's
office

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
and and maybe get an opinion from them
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
and just kind of an explanation of
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
really what does that mean
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
if we end the fund with a budgetary
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
surplus but a gap
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
deficit what does that mean you know
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
what's the impact
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
um and i and i think that's appropriate
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
to to explore
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
yes i i i certainly would appreciate you
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
doing that mickey
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh let's see uh representative bucco
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
i think you had a question yes thank you
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think you just asked it but i i was
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify for my own
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
um what just what the estimated gap
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
adjustment is
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
because it seems it's it's 27 million
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's pretty large
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
most of it is just i think accounts
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
payable it's just
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
liabilities on the books at the at june
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
30 that that the highway fund has
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
future expenditures related to um
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
i mean if if for the committee's uh
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
information if we did want to dive into
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
the you know the gap adjustment and the
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
gap balance i i think we could
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
i could reach out to the comptroller's
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
office like i said we can get get some
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
more information on that
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair uh mickey i
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
i guess though
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
um mine is sort of a follow-up maybe to
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative buccos um
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
i understand i think i understand the
 
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:45.670 align:start position:0%
i understand i think i understand the
the

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
27 million dollar gap adjustment
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
but what i'm not sure i understand then
 
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.309 align:start position:0%
but what i'm not sure i understand then
is

00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
when if if the if there's a deficit
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the 3 million 156 at the end of
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
when i when you go to fiscal 22 you
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't start with that number but you
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
start with the 23 844
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i'm not quite sure i
 
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.390 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i'm not quite sure i
understand

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know and then the same thing in for
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
from 22 to 23
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
um it's uh i think so could you just
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
sure uh so the gap adjustment is
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
something that is for an account
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
presentation like a fun presentation
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
from an accounting standard point of
 
00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:30.870 align:start position:0%
from an accounting standard point of
view

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
but it reverses when you start the next
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
year so there's like a reversing
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
entry that uh
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm getting into deep deep accounting
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
that we usually don't do with um
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
with finance committee but essentially
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
a snapshot in time representative that
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
as of june 30
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 this is the state of the
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
highway fund but that gap entry would
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
reverse because there's an expectation
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to be making those payments
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
and all those liabilities are part of
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
your budget that next year
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
so it's really just to show the state of
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
the highway fund that yes we have 23
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the bank
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
but we have 27 million dollars in bills
 
00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
but we have 27 million dollars in bills
outstanding

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
outstanding
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
we only carry the budgetary balance
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
forward because we assume those 27
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars in bills are going to be
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
paid in that next year we're already
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
paying for them here
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm probably not explaining this all
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
really well and it is a confusing thing
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
um but if if like i said i don't think
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
you would harm because i
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think we've done it in my time
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
with division two which is pushing a
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
decade now
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
um just kind of hearing from the
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
comptroller perhaps or
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
even the director of finance maria dot
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
will be able to walk the division
 
00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:46.870 align:start position:0%
will be able to walk the division
through

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
the you know financial statements
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
presentation of the highway fund and
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're talking here
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
from a budgetary point of view if you
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
only cared about money in the bank
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's this line okay no it's the
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
budgetary balance line but
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
the the precedent has always been to try
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
to balance the highway fund
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
on a gap on an accrual basis gap basis
 
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.870 align:start position:0%
on a gap on an accrual basis gap basis
too

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you obviously that makes perfect
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
mickey so if i'm looking at this
 
00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.430 align:start position:0%
mickey so if i'm looking at this
correctly

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
that at the with the um
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
the shortage in
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
21 that we have now
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
reduced the quote-unquote
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
surplus in 22 to 23
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
844 correct that's right
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we're starting out at 23 8 44.
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
yep yep so if we carry that balance
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
to how we're going to start with fiscal
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
22 with that
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's essentially the same situation for
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
revenue base revenues are bumped up a
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
um i think this is related to just
 
00:57:13.119 --> 00:57:13.670 align:start position:0%
um i think this is related to just
hopefully

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
more people on the road more people the
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
plan for the next two years versus the
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
last two
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
more fuel will be consumed and more road
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
toll will be paid on that
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
we've got our department of safety
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
appropriations there's a couple of
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
things going on in fiscal 22.
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
first on line 13 oops
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
on line 13 back in 2018
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
when we had a general fund surplus one
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the uses for
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh i believe it was a 20 million dollar
 
00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:49.670 align:start position:0%
uh i believe it was a 20 million dollar
appropriation

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
was a general fund appropriation to the
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
department of transportation for
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
bridge work for red list bridge projects
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's been identified there's 8.1
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
remaining in that appropriation and the
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
recommends lapsing that remaining
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation right into the highway
 
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:08.950 align:start position:0%
appropriation right into the highway
fund

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
to help balance the highway fund so that
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
one time
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
adjustment of revenue you will see that
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
and that essentially helps the bottom
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
line of the highway fund by 8.1 million
 
00:58:20.839 --> 00:58:25.670 align:start position:0%
line of the highway fund by 8.1 million
dollars

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
another uh thing to point out here on in
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
is the department of transportation's
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
draw appropriations off the highway fund
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
so you see how last year or current year
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
rather 230
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 232 and it's way down in
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal 201
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
22 and if you recall the department
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
talked about having some federal money
 
00:58:46.319 --> 00:58:46.950 align:start position:0%
talked about having some federal money
available

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
that they were able to supplant in
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
operations to the tune of about 42
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars i believe it was
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
so when we look at the highway
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
operations accounting unit
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the budget document the big budget
 
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.069 align:start position:0%
in the budget document the big budget
document

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
highway funds are way down and there's a
 
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.430 align:start position:0%
highway funds are way down and there's a
federal

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
fund plug in there because of some
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
available federal dollars
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh that were uh pandemic related i
 
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.710 align:start position:0%
uh that were uh pandemic related i
believe

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
to um help run or help
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
operate transportation systems so that
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
is a big help to the bottom line of the
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
highway fund otherwise you'd have a 41
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh higher transportation appropriation
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
here which of course would affect your
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
bottom line accordingly so
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
that's why dot is so much lower in this
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
middle year
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
the december
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh relief bill i believe it is but i can
 
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.589 align:start position:0%
uh relief bill i believe it is but i can
confirm

00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
i i know we'll have uh the department in
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
later this week
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
to confirm that but i i it's money
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's already been
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
approved it's not an anticipation of
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay so so is is this money going in the
 
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
okay so so is is this money going in the
budget

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
or is it going to come in through fiscal
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's in the budget so it's in house bill
 
01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.349 align:start position:0%
it's in the budget so it's in house bill
one

01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
or it will be in house well it's in the
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget documents
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be something accepted
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
through fiscal it would be budgeted
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh tom you have a
 
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.750 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh tom you have a
question

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you i i just is that
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
oh so the 41 million dollars
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
yeah is it yes well the fed yeah that
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
federal money is that
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
is that somewhere within these numbers
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's not it the money
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually go to the highway fund
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
it just reduces how much highway fund
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
has to be used so
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
when you look at this line represented
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
you see that the dot transportation
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
or the dot appropriation goes from 230
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
million down to 182
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
back to 232. back to where you see it
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
let me if i can hear because you can see
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
you skip it here we go
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the highway
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance bureau this is one of the
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
largest accounting units of highway
 
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:25.990 align:start position:0%
largest accounting units of highway
funds

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
at the department so their highway funds
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
you can see on this line here i don't
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
know if you can see that well
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine um go from 66 million
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
dollars this year
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
to 22 million dollars next year and
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds go from zero
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
to 41 million that's that's where you
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
in this accounting unit so it really
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
reduces the draw from highway funds in
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
this year because there's federal funds
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
in their place
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so in the event that
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
more funds um from the federal
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
government come in
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
specific to um covid
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
will we be appraised that because that
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
right now with the governor's executive
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
order he has
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much authority over all of that
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we don't
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
get an accounting of that how would we
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
find out how it might impact our budget
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
um was that question for me yes
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh so so if if funds are accepted
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh federal funds accepted and budgeted
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
through the executive order
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
i believe those are reported to fiscal
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
and we can ask for that information
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
from the departments as we go through
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
this process uh an option while
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
the budget is being worked on is to
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually add those appropriations to
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
house bill one
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
you know that can still be done
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
throughout this process if there's a we
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
know we're gonna get this federal money
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know or um you know the more
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
traditional way would have been
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
you know outside of the budget process
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
to accept those dollars through fiscal
 
01:03:09.359 --> 01:03:10.069 align:start position:0%
to accept those dollars through fiscal
so

01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's a few options i don't
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
really know what the course of action
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
should money become available from
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
washington during this process
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh representative
 
01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:22.230 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh representative
heath

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
heath
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
if you if you remember from our uh
 
01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:25.829 align:start position:0%
if you if you remember from our uh
discussion

01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
with uh commissioner edelblue he had
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
an additional 157 million dollars
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
that had come into doe
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes on one of the whatever
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh grants yes yeah yes
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
whatever okay yes let me let me get my
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
piece of paper here
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
yeah under s or two and so um
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
it appears that
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
doe has chosen not to put that in the
 
01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.069 align:start position:0%
doe has chosen not to put that in the
budget

01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay yeah okay and so
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
whereas d.o.t chose to put that in the
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's i don't think
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's any consistency
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
across the various uh
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
departments oh thank you madam chance if
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
i can ask
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
one more question um i remember i was
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
actually working at the department
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
in 2008 when we had the era money
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
and during that time we used
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
um about 200 million i believe of that
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
money to uh balance our adequacy because
 
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
money to uh balance our adequacy because
we

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
back then we're in a a big hole um
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
so what i'm here what i think i'm
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
hearing you say
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
is that commissioner edelblue has
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
chosen not to use any of those
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that come under the
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
authority of the department of ed
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
to go into the state money that we send
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
to school districts
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
i know i know that school districts are
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
getting allocations that go
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
directly to them um so that that we
 
01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:15.349 align:start position:0%
directly to them um so that that we
can't

01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
do anything about that that that has to
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
go to them
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
but the funds that go to the department
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
of ed can't be used
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
accepts that fund to be used in a
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
different way
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm making any sense uh
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're making sense
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
but only if you've spent a million years
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
the real key here is and i don't know
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
the answer to this
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
and we can talk a little bit more to doe
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
but whether there is specific guidance
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
from the federal government as to how
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
those dollars can be spent
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
and they may not be able to be spent for
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
things that we would like to spend them
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
for and i
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i also saw a report
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
that showed um the fact that a lot
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think it was i don't remember what the
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
figure was
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
but a lot of money that has been sent to
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
the school districts
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
that has not been spent yet and so
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
it's um you know it's a real balancing
 
01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:33.349 align:start position:0%
it's um you know it's a real balancing
act

01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh as to um you know
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead i'm sorry if i could just add
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
actually had a meeting with commissioner
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
edelblut in the manchester school
 
01:06:50.319 --> 01:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
edelblut in the manchester school
district

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
just about that because i was concerned
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
because i had been working with caitlin
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
to see about the sec
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
the second round of esser money coming
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
in from manchester
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
and and we learned that um they had not
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
drawn down very much money but then we
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
found out that they had a huge
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
technology order that had been delayed
 
01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:11.430 align:start position:0%
technology order that had been delayed
and

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
that's why the money was and i think
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's happening across our state
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
but i think um more more importantly my
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
my big concern and hope
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
maybe is that if new dollars come in
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
with new federal dollars that we will
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
have some authority
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
to help in ultimately
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
balancing our state general funds budget
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
with some federal funds is is what my
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
hope is to help us out
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if i'm just being too
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
optimistic about that
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
yeah part of part of the concern uh is
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
that just like the 62 million that was
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
distributed this year
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
um you know and went out and explained
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it was one time money
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
for you know hard
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know things that you didn't have to
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
replace every year
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
and you know school boards made
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
decisions and that's the that's the real
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
one of the real problems that we have
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know i'm all for local control but
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
it also
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
throws a big monkey wrench into
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
what the state can and cannot do so
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that transportation has decided
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
so mickey you want to
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
talk to us about the rest of this mess
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah well there's not a whole lot else
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
to get into super
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
detail with um it's just that year would
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
end with
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
49 million dollars on a budgetary basis
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the highway fund
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
we kind of do the same thing again carry
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
it forward to start 23
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
based on our expected revenues
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
and budgeted appropriations as of right
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
now in the governor's recommended budget
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
these are the 16 million budgetary
 
01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:06.229 align:start position:0%
these are the 16 million budgetary
balance

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
balance
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
if we want to show our liabilities and
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
receivables the
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
position the net position is really a
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
negative for the highway fund
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
and i will get like i said i will get a
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
memo or something some explanation from
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
the comptroller's office and from the
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
department uh
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
to just so we're more informed on the
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
impacts of
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
balancing the highway fund on a
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
budgetary versus a gap basis
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
just so that'll help make your decisions
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that will be uh extremely
 
01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:36.149 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that will be uh extremely
helpful

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
to us and it's and i you know it is the
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's the uh that's the uh the
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
real problem so
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh can we take a five-minute break
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
and then we'll uh press on to
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
what we may think is in
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
as soon as bob returns
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
we'll uh go ahead and uh
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
chris i'm so happy that you're here
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
um i would uh i would like to say that
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not real happy about what ways
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
and means is done to
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
us and i know you don't have a lot of
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
influence in that
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just staffing for the ways and means
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
so i do what they ask me to do
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for adding us on to the mailing
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
list by the way
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh not a pro not a problem um are you
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
getting the revenue focus
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh represent murray you haven't received
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue focus from administrative
 
01:13:45.679 --> 01:13:46.709 align:start position:0%
the revenue focus from administrative
services

01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so okay i'll
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'll ask them to add the um finance
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
seems like we were getting a last one
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee was what happened
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
last session the finance committee was
 
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.229 align:start position:0%
last session the finance committee was
on

01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually the ways and means committee
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
so they got i think they got ways and
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
means on this time and took you guys off
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
so i'll make sure you get that
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's actually i i would suggest
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
probably a better tool to look at than
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
the daily report that i would send out
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
starting on the 20th
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
because it actually provides a little
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
bit more information in terms of why
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
some of your revenues might be up or
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
down for the month
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
and then gives you a um a year-to-date
 
01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.390 align:start position:0%
and then gives you a um a year-to-date
information

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
as well um but happy to keep you um you
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
know on the
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
daily revenues we do just uh i know you
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
guys get a lot of emails so that's why i
 
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:37.590 align:start position:0%
guys get a lot of emails so that's why i
don't

01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
um chase it well we appreciate it
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
welcome back and um
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
mickey if you would uh like to begin
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
our tentative
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 stuff okay so please i think mickey
 
01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.470 align:start position:0%
hb2 stuff okay so please i think mickey
has

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
warned us significantly that
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
um you know what what actually happens
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
with the final version is
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
what becomes our starting point and not
 
01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
what becomes our starting point and not
necessarily

01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
what we have here and i'm sure that
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
as soon as hb2 is available that
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
send it to us uh either through the mail
 
01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.270 align:start position:0%
send it to us uh either through the mail
or

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
ups or whatever fedex
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
or courier service yeah i think we'll
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
definitely get a hard copy
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
to you you know it's a little lengthy of
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
a document of course so
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
we'll send those out once we get them
 
01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.270 align:start position:0%
we'll send those out once we get them
printed

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
printed
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
and and representative you're right in
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to stay super high level
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
so we did get back when the governor's
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
budget came out a transmission from the
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
governor's office with trailer bill
 
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.229 align:start position:0%
governor's office with trailer bill
language

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
per the law's requirement which it goes
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the office of legislative services
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
and they start you know working their
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
magic to turn it into a
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the proper format references and all
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
that of house bill 2.
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
so i'll go over today with some of the
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
topics that
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
um we saw in the draft i'm not going to
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
get into any detail really
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
because i know that there was just some
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
clarifications back and forth still with
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and ols so i don't
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
super confident on something and tell
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
you about it from the draft document
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
then it comes out different with the
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
introduced bill so um
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
some of this will be repetitive with
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
stuff we already know about
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
so first with education funding i
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
believe the only change that we're going
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
to have there
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
is relative to an adjustment to the
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
free reduced lunch population for
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
determining adequate education grants
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
the specifics of that i think will be
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
slightly different than the bill
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
um that that's in that's going to pass
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
over from the senate
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
as far as just straight up using prior
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
year counts i think there's going to be
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
a formula for determining the adjustment
 
01:17:12.239 --> 01:17:13.110 align:start position:0%
a formula for determining the adjustment
we'll

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
should be able to go through that
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
wednesday with the department because
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
they would have been involved with
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
developing the budget terry number
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure fund
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
the transfer from the education trust
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
fund to that
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund will be in house bill 2.
 
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.630 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund will be in house bill 2.
um

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
we saw it on this the surplus document
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the snapshot we went through earlier the
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars a year so it'll be up
 
01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:38.550 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars a year so it'll be up
to

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
the division to support change delete
 
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:41.910 align:start position:0%
the division to support change delete
whatever

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
um but whatever change we make to that
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
we heard friday an awful lot about the
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
proposal to form
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire college and university
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
system board of trustees and explore
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
a consolidation of the two systems of
 
01:18:00.239 --> 01:18:03.270 align:start position:0%
a consolidation of the two systems of
unification

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
we will see all the details of at least
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
what's going to be proposed legislated
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
this session and what the charge would
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
be for that
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
board of trustees moving forward all the
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
specifics of course
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
all this would be in house bill 2. we
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
saw a little bit of the house bill one
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
change just the structure of the budget
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
merging those two into one
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
agency so to speak and one accounting
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
unit for their block appropriation
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
but most of the work and the decision
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
making would be in house bill 2
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative heath you have a
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
going back to the merger um i've been
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what the difference
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
was um in the merger year
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
and it looks like there's um a total
 
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
and it looks like there's um a total
reduction

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the amount of money going to both
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
well i don't know how it's going to go
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
but do you have the exact figure of how
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
much that reduction is
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
oh um well i can show you the page from
 
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
oh um well i can show you the page from
uh

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
the budget and we can maybe do a what
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
page is that
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
i can't ask man i'm not sure
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah page uh one two nine five
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
where you'll see the the appropriations
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then just the one thing to remember
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
when when looking at those
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think you can see my screen here i'll
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
maybe i can
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
the the amounts for um
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
20 fiscal 20 the university system
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
included nine million dollars one-time
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
money for the nursing
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
program yeah and the community college
 
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.709 align:start position:0%
program yeah and the community college
included

01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
i want to say 3.2 million dollars of
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
one-time money for uh
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
it really i can't remember the specifics
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
so that first year includes some
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
one-time money when you're looking at
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
the four years across the board just
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point that out
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative petry
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
not a problem uh thank you
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
um right donny uh can you tell me what
 
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.229 align:start position:0%
um right donny uh can you tell me what
the

01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
chancellor's uh budget is for the
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
um i can get that information for you i
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know off the top of my
 
01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know off the top of my
head

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
head
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
um that that doesn't appear in the
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
the state or house bill one of course so
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'd have to reach out to
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh kathy provencher and she can get us
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
the details on that for you
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
right could you make that all inclusive
 
01:20:48.639 --> 01:20:51.189 align:start position:0%
right could you make that all inclusive
yep

01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
and that was just for usnh or
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
yeah well you can compare the two it
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't hurt to have the uh
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
community college system also
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
and uh just a comment uh you're one
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
awesome individual agreed
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
so moving on uh scholarship programs i
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see some
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations to
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
the existing state scholarship programs
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the development of the
 
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
as well as the development of the
workforce

01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
student debt relief program for those
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
who have been on finance
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you remember from last
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
session this was something that came in
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
to finance from the governor's office a
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
it ultimately ended up not being in the
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
house budget and ended up
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
being debated quite a bit in the senate
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
but ultimately didn't happen two years
 
01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.750 align:start position:0%
but ultimately didn't happen two years
ago

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh so this will be something that we
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
will bring in the
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
mat the experts on these scholarship
 
01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:56.950 align:start position:0%
mat the experts on these scholarship
programs

01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll have the unique program the
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
endowment the direct
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
allocation programs the governor's
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship program is under that
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
advisory board
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
as well as well as really moving forward
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the new student debt relief
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
proposal so
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
again none of this should affect general
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
or head or education trust funds in any
 
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.189 align:start position:0%
or head or education trust funds in any
way

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
this would be the governor's scholarship
 
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
this would be the governor's scholarship
program

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a general funded program but i don't
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
think that's being
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
changed in any way uh with this proposal
 
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.229 align:start position:0%
changed in any way uh with this proposal
um

01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
but just to be aware of that program and
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
that that's in the treasury's budget so
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't see it in any
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
anything that we have here but that's a
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
but the unique program this uh workforce
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
debt relief program this would be from
 
01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:45.270 align:start position:0%
debt relief program this would be from
that

01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
the fidelity accounts assessment fees
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
the management fees that the state
 
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.270 align:start position:0%
the management fees that the state
collects

01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
collects
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's a restricted source of revenue
 
01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:52.709 align:start position:0%
that's a restricted source of revenue
that's

01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
currently used for that endowment and
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and this just talks
 
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.669 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and this just talks
about

01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
spreading that money out to other uses
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
too the mainly the
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
workforce development student debt
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
relief program
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
so moving on we talked this morning with
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
the highway surplus statement of the
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh redless bridge appropriation lapse of
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
the highway fund as a way to prop up the
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
highway fund so we will see that in
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
so if you want to change that in any way
 
01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
so if you want to change that in any way
um

01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
amend it agree with it delete it uh this
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see this change in house bill 2
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then we'll recognize it on
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
the surplus statement representative
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
murray you have a question
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um is this
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
does this lapse have to happen or could
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
it stay uh could we consider
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
to say you know i'm not proposing this
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
but um keep the eight million and work
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
on those red listed bridges
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
so currently that 20 million original
 
01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:50.470 align:start position:0%
so currently that 20 million original
appropriation

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
is non-lapsing and continually
 
01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
is non-lapsing and continually
appropriated

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
so if you left it there it would be
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
available for the department to carry
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
out the original purpose of that
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
so we have a decision to make there and
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
we could get dot's input on how they
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
could best manage that fund or
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
the money that's in
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
the only thing just uh obviously any
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
change to that would affect
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
the amount available for the highway
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
fund just to remember but yes
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
yep thank you uh
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative heath did you have no
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh the last significant section of
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 from the draft that we saw
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
was relative to establishing the
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
bodyboard and dash
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
board cam fund which um
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
again i don't want to speak to too many
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
specifics and i did put an amount in
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
here and i don't i think it's going to
 
01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.910 align:start position:0%
here and i don't i think it's going to
remain

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
remain
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
but there was an initial general fund
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation um
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
to fund this program which essentially
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be a matching program for local
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies to
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh buy uh replace operate
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
body warrant and dash cam systems with
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
their department
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair in the last
 
01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.430 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair in the last
budget

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
we approved um dash cameras
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
for all the state police cruisers um
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
i asked the commissioner about that but
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
i wasn't clear on his answer because he
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
said that we didn't do that so
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
did they just not not institute the
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
program or what happened there
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
or do you know uh well i i don't know
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
the specifics
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
but we can get that information with our
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up with safety this week
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you any amount that would
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
have been appropriated and not expended
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
would have lapsed back to the general
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
and highway funds so
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
whether they did all their cruisers none
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
something in between i'm not sure
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
um but we can talk to them about what
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
happened with those
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
appropriations in the current budget
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
i should have started off by saying that
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think this was the lightest load for
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
division two with house bill 2
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
i've seen in a while at least even for
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
an introduced version of the bill
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
those at least in the draft document
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
were the major impacts
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
as far as policy to work on and direct
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
budget impacts
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
there was many other sections that will
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
be assigned to us to review but
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
um don't really have a direct budget
 
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.030 align:start position:0%
um don't really have a direct budget
impact

01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
a material one um and i'll go through
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
them real quick
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
so the department of safety uh in the
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
current budget they have some
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
transfer authority language that allows
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
them with the approval of the
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
budget office to transfer from some
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
class lines
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
that are otherwise restricted class
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
lines to transfer from
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
it was something granted to them two
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
years ago uh as a way to offer
 
01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
years ago uh as a way to offer
flexibility

01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
that they seem that they deem necessary
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
to uh manage their budget for the two
 
01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:57.510 align:start position:0%
to uh manage their budget for the two
years

01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
and it's something that the governor has
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
supported for this this biennium too so
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
um it'll be up to you to
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
review that section and whether or not
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
you want to give it to them it won't
 
01:27:08.719 --> 01:27:09.270 align:start position:0%
you want to give it to them it won't
have

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
an impact one way or another on spending
 
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:12.870 align:start position:0%
an impact one way or another on spending
so

01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
um it's really a policy decision a
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
finance policy decision
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
the mechanical licensing board we heard
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
from the department of safety that this
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
has been moved in this budget to the
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.149 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
certification

01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
that accounting unit is zeroed out in
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
safety and
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's transferred over to be a
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
division one budget to review now
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
and they will probably review the house
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill 2 section as well and give a thumbs
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
up or thumbs down on this it'll probably
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
be something assigned to them
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
generally whenever there's a transfer of
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
a unit or a function
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
when we assign division responsibilities
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
we usually give it to the
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
the accepting uh division so in this
 
01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:55.910 align:start position:0%
the accepting uh division so in this
case

01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
division one will probably decide on
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
that but i did put this on here just so
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
you were aware of it because it was
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
something we had heard from the agency
 
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.030 align:start position:0%
something we had heard from the agency
about

01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh mickey did you say that it was
 
01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh mickey did you say that it was
already

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the budget in office of professional
 
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
in the budget in office of professional
licensure

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
i believe it is if you look at fire
 
01:28:13.199 --> 01:28:14.550 align:start position:0%
i believe it is if you look at fire
safety

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
in safety that accounting unit zeroed
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
out and i believe it's uh
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
that money is now resides in office of
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
professional licensure those general
 
01:28:22.639 --> 01:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
professional licensure those general
funds

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
so the only the only question on this
 
01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:27.669 align:start position:0%
so the only the only question on this
then

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
is um do we think it's a good idea
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
right to move it and that could be a
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
joint decision with
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
division one you know because they would
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
have to be yeah we want
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
oplc our professional licensure to take
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
this on and
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
division two to be okay with you know
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
sending that
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh function over over there so but in
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
the budget that how you have it before
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
you house bill 2 and house bill 1 will
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
have it so the money and the function is
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
no longer at safety okay
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
for those of you that i know probably
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
tom is aware of this
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
but uh we had been trying to move the
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
over for years and um
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
it was uh hotly opposed by
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
safety but it appears they have uh
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
changed their mind so i'm
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm real happy about that
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh the next item um there is a section
 
01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh the next item um there is a section
relative

01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
relative
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
to radio equipment
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
procurement really purchasing and
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
outfitting radio across state agencies
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll hear a little bit more
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
about this from the department but i
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
think the idea is that the department
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
would establish standards
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the department of administrative
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
services so
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more uniformity
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
across all state agencies versus each
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
state agency kind of
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
going on their own when it comes to
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
radio operations
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there's a direct budget
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
impact to that i don't think there's any
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
funding attributable to it but that's
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's one that i kind of just have with
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
an asterisk here that we just want to
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
double check with the department to see
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
if there is any direct or indirect
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
budget impact the last bullet for safety
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think is one we can ignore uh in the
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
early draft there was some capital
 
01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
early draft there was some capital
appropriation

01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh lapses and repurposing within the
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
department of safety from the last
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is those sections are
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
not going to be in house bill 2
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
and they are going to be in house bill
 
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.310 align:start position:0%
and they are going to be in house bill
25

01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
so it will be up to public works and
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
highways to figure that out
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
it won't affect your house bill one or
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
two um and this is just a good example
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
of how
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh we get the draft of house bill too
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
early but that doesn't necessarily mean
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
this stuff's gonna be in house bill 2 is
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
introduced you know so
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
i think we can ignore that um but i'll
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
confirm with with the division once we
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
fish and game department mickey
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry chris you have a you have a
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
question or a comment
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
no i just wanted to comment on on that
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
um capital appropriation i know it's in
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 25 i worked with the
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
governor's office to
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
figure out where it really belonged so
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
they worked with ols to remove it from
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 and to put it in 25 so
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
you won't need to worry about that in
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
so fish and game department in the draft
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
document there was uh
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
a couple of sections relative to the
 
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.430 align:start position:0%
a couple of sections relative to the
statutory

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
provisions around bear damage and this
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
the process for getting
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
fish and game state reimbursement for
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
the damage caused
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe this has any impact
 
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe this has any impact
on

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
state general funds for sure uh
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
what we can hear from the department or
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
once we actually see the language maybe
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know we can figure out really what's
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
going on if it's budget
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
impact or just a policy thing that the
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
department has to be included in house
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
department of transportation again oh i
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
think we have a question
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm sorry rebson murray
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
i was looking at my paper and not at my
 
01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
i was looking at my paper and not at my
screen

01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
screen
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
i do the same thing um i just wanted to
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
go back and check
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
because dispatch moved or fish and games
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
dispatched emergency dispatch moves to
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
department of safety and um that's not
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
reflected in hb2 is that
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
why is why is that not here i guess just
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a change that's
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
notable but not necessarily going to
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
affect us fiscally
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
no it's a good question and um again the
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
draft didn't have anything that was like
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
explicit you know these functions move
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
i think positions maybe in house bill 1
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
got transferred and the budget itself
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
can do those without needing a house
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
bill to change
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
but we can confirm that with the
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
departments to see if any
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
legislation is necessary to make that
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
change work but i didn't see anything
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
relative to that specifically in the in
 
01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:07.990 align:start position:0%
relative to that specifically in the in
the

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
dot there's a few statues changed that
 
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.270 align:start position:0%
dot there's a few statues changed that
are

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
mostly policy in nature or when i say
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
they're not really going to directly
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
impact your appropriations i don't
 
01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
impact your appropriations i don't
believe

01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
one was uh changing some of the criteria
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
civil liability for folks who damaged
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
the highway
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
in any of in any way as far as getting a
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or a replacement
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
charge to them or through insurance or
 
01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.510 align:start position:0%
charge to them or through insurance or
however

01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think that would
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a revenue that we would
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
address or
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't impact anything like that
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
this would be just something dot has
 
01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.070 align:start position:0%
this would be just something dot has
identified

01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
as a change that they wanted and rec and
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
requested as part of the
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
budget process and it's in was in the
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
draft document
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
similarly we currently have a law
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the disposal
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
of pro-c or the proceeds relative to the
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
disposal of
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
real estate purchase with uh highway or
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
um it was silent i believe on federal
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
funds and
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
say what happens with the proceeds of a
 
01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.310 align:start position:0%
say what happens with the proceeds of a
sale

01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
of a real estate highway-related real
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
estate that was acquired with federal
 
01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.709 align:start position:0%
estate that was acquired with federal
funds

01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
lastly i noticed in the draft documents
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
some sections that just added some
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
definitions relative to unmanned
 
01:34:36.239 --> 01:34:36.950 align:start position:0%
definitions relative to unmanned
aircrafts

01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
aircrafts
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
or drones um i didn't see anything
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
anything direct to the budget with those
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
i think it was uh
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
some policy stuff added the department
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
identified they needed um
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
and again for the usual when we get the
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
department in to talk about these things
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
they can explain
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
why they're needed or what the impacts
 
01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.870 align:start position:0%
why they're needed or what the impacts
are

01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh mickey before you before you leave
 
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.830 align:start position:0%
uh mickey before you before you leave
that

01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
is the transportation committee
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for all of this
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
or does some of it fall in public works
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
like the civil liability i mean i'm just
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
i i just want to know which chairman i
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
um a good question i i would say
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
i would say i would say the first two i
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
mean just
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
would be public works and highway
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps and then the aeronautics related
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
stuff would be transportation committee
 
01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.629 align:start position:0%
stuff would be transportation committee
but

01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
um maybe if might be one of the things
 
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:33.750 align:start position:0%
um maybe if might be one of the things
worth

01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
worth
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
sending to both the chairman and getting
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
their their comments on i'm not sure
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
and they could decide oh yeah we do this
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
or not i'm not sure to answer the
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
question only because it's
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's amending the law and so
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
we we really need some sort of input so
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you what
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'll make sure that i harass both
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
transportation and public works to get
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
me something back on this
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that has happened in the past what
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
we've done with finance is some of these
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
policy related sections that show up in
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
we'll get feedback from the policy
 
01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
we'll get feedback from the policy
committee

01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know on them uh i don't know if
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's the plan this time i think it's
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
just a little bit early we haven't even
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
seen the bill and divvied up the
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
sections yet by division to take that
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
next step of whether or not the policy
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
committees will be part of it but that's
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
definitely something i think
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
the committee as a whole will have to
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
figure out soon uh
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative wyler did send out a
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
an email to all of the um
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
committees on the areas that
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
in the draft would were
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh affecting them and asked for
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
um as for input so that has
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
that train has left the station okay
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
good and uh
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
obviously if there's additional things
 
01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.030 align:start position:0%
obviously if there's additional things
that

01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh that come out or whatever
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have to follow up on that okay
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
all right the uh the last
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
section and this is something that is a
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
reoccurring section
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
so kind of back what you were suggesting
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
before representative lin
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
as far as sections that appear in house
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
over and over so the new hampshire
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
scholars program
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh has had language in-house bill 2 that
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
allows for the department of education
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
to accept grants gifts donations to fund
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
that function
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
um it was in the last house bill 2 but
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
it was for the biennium only
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to appear again and house
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
bill 2 is introduced
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
for this biennium as well if it's
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
something that the committee supports
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
i mean it could be codified you could
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
amend statute so it doesn't appear every
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
year you know in the trailer bill
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that's something we can discuss when
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
when we're going through these sections
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
um actually two that i want to ask
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
um the first one was related to the new
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire scholars program
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's been zeroed out in the budget but
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to see it continue my
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
um from debbie scary i've been talking
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
with her
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
about the scholars program because i
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
know senator d'alessandro was very upset
 
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:22.790 align:start position:0%
know senator d'alessandro was very upset
about

01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
it it its demise we thought it would be
 
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.709 align:start position:0%
it it its demise we thought it would be
eliminated

01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to try and figure out some
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
way to keep it going
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
so is that what the intent is of that
 
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.750 align:start position:0%
so is that what the intent is of that
statement

01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and or would it be possible for us to
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
um contemplate maybe a small amount of
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
money that can go because it used to be
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
i believe 100 000 for each year of the
 
01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.669 align:start position:0%
i believe 100 000 for each year of the
biennium

01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
and now it's been um eliminated um
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
and that's up to the division so um if
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
you want to propose an amendment that
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
adds a
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
you know x dollars whatever you pick
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
into that line to keep that accounting
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
unit on
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget and then also
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 section that enables
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
outside money to come in to fund it
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's up to you okay thank you
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
and my second question
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
is going back to the top
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
about the merger about between the
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
community college and the university
 
01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.070 align:start position:0%
community college and the university
system

01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
would it be possible and i don't know
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
the answer to this
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing through finance
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
to get input from people about
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing um in house bill
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
2 um and in the budget just to get input
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
i feel like we haven't done due
 
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
i feel like we haven't done due
diligence

01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
diligence
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
in getting information about the merger
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
um so would it be possible is my
 
01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:48.629 align:start position:0%
um so would it be possible is my
question

01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing with regard to
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
the merger mary
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
that that is certainly uh possible
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and i can do it for division two
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
since uh um the other folks have
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of other things to do obviously
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
our our meetings are open to the public
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
and i have um but i
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
i can certainly announce it for
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
one day shortly that um this will be
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and then the folks will
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
um send in their you know whatever
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
through um uh yeah through the website
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
to uh to talk about it um
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how does the rest of
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
the committee think that this is a uh
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
a good idea can you just give me a
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
mickey i'm only i'm sorry i'm i haven't
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
don't see uh representative lin and
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative petrie do you
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
i do see them i see a thumbs up for
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative petry
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay represent are you on board
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know i guess my only question would
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
be i mean i
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
i don't really see a particular harm but
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
my only question would be
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
um is this something that um
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
we ought to we ought to sort of run up
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
the flagpole so to speak
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
and see how um leadership
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
feels about that i've i'm but i'm
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know i've that's i speak as a
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
newcomer who doesn't really know a lot
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
ins and outs of the of how things work
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
so that that's just a question i have no
 
01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.550 align:start position:0%
so that that's just a question i have no
particular

01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know view one way or the other on
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
whether we should hold it here
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
um basically under the old system when
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
we all
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
used to uh arrive in concord for
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh our discussions um
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
people that had interest in whatever we
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
would be sitting in our
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
room and if there were questions or
 
01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.070 align:start position:0%
room and if there were questions or
comments

01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
or thoughts they would be
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
expressed at that time although we
 
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:31.430 align:start position:0%
expressed at that time although we
didn't

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
call it a public hearing and i'm not
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
sure that we will call this a public
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
hearing but
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
we'll call it something that indicates
 
01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
we'll call it something that indicates
that

01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
that people should tune in and
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
ask their questions now the other thing
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
is is that sometime in late march
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
we will in fact be holding a
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
budget public hearing uh to
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh to hear from from
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
people and i'm not exactly sure when
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be that'll be up
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
to uh representative
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
wyler but i do want to
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh oh thank you mickey i do want to um
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't know how i'm gonna
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
how i'm gonna phrase it but
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think this is such a a huge
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
change that folks need to be aware
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
of of what's going on and i mean
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
all of us you know if you
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
if you know people that are
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
current trustees past trustees
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
of either system
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
or if um
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know you you know kids that are
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
attending the schools
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know they may not they may not have
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
an opinion on that but
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know we we just need to i think
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
a broad range of of what's
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh of what's happening and of course we
 
01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
what uh what is um
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's uh what the language is
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
going to look like
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the language i think in this case is
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just i miss the
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
input that we used to get from the
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes i do too and uh i have not
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
seen anyone raise their hand as a
 
01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.950 align:start position:0%
seen anyone raise their hand as a
participant

01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
participant
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
because i think it was it's clear
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
in my opening statement that that is
 
01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
in my opening statement that that is
certainly

01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
an option for for people but
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
i have not although i don't check it all
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
the time i do check it every
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know as we're finishing up things to
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
see if the
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh if anybody out there in uh zoom land
 
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:12.709 align:start position:0%
uh if anybody out there in uh zoom land
has

01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh mickey i really want to thank
 
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.070 align:start position:0%
okay uh mickey i really want to thank
you

01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
for what you did um
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
i think it gives us all a uh a clearer
 
01:45:28.719 --> 01:45:29.350 align:start position:0%
i think it gives us all a uh a clearer
picture

01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
of of where we are
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and what's happening
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
and um although
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
i am disappointed in what ways and means
 
01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:43.510 align:start position:0%
i am disappointed in what ways and means
has

01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
given us to work with that's what we
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
have to work with
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh we have no choice and so
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
fund certain things then we have to
 
01:45:58.960 --> 01:45:59.830 align:start position:0%
fund certain things then we have to
realize

01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
realize
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we got to take it from some place
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
and um and uh
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's got to be the way
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
so it's uh you know we can we can juggle
 
01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:14.229 align:start position:0%
so it's uh you know we can we can juggle
around

01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
the money within the education trust
 
01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.990 align:start position:0%
the money within the education trust
fund

01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh but we can't create new money
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
unless someone has a money tree out back
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
that is still growing it's too cold up
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
here for me to have a money tree so
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay um i think that uh
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
our next meeting is wednesday
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
at uh 10 o'clock when we will be
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
in particular i think we were going to
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
adequate education is that correct
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
and um i do think that
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh one day shortly we'll need to go
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
through all of the division all of the
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
departments on more of a
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
line by line discussion
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
and uh so that uh where we're seeing
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know tran highway funds general
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
funds all of these things
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
we really need to to look at that
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh obviously a little more closely
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
than what we have and i also
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
if you do have a chance before
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
is d.o.t on thursday i think we have dot

friday safety okay
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
