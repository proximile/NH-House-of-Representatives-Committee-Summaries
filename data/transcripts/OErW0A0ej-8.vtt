00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
morning morning mam Chief welcome to
 
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
Edna I'm opening the public hearing on
 
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
PR good morning Madam chairman and the
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee it is nice to be
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
back in Edna
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
again uh this morning I'm coming with a
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
bill that was requested by one of my
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
constituents who worked with a person
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
who is a dentist in another
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
country uh and now that she's and had
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
practiced there for some time and now
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
since she immigrated legally to this
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
country um she can't use any of her
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
education well and I take that back a
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
little bit she is an assistant to a
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
dentist a dental assistant and that's
 
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
about as much as she can do um without
 
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
having to go through through the
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
whole dental school again which is a a
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
large chunk of money but a lot of time
 
00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
if we could come up with some kind of
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
program that they can have a special
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
license under the supervision of a of a
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
licensed dentist
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
to maybe utilize those skills better
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
um and that's why I'm bringing this and
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
I know you can see the the Bold in the
 
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
the bill of the change but I would also
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
like to add dental offices that um the
 
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
dentist signs off on that they're okay
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
with this person working underneath them
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
granted we would have to vet them and
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe come up with some kind of
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
program as you know uh especially in our
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
state the
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
U shortage of dentists and dental
 
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
hygienists and all of that whole uh area
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
I is pretty high we're always looking uh
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
for more and it seems like again here in
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I know there's a national
 
00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:51.870 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I know there's a national
uh

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
certification board that oversees this
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see if we can't make
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
it a little bit easier here in New
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for them to be able to expand
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
their their abilities and their scope of
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
practice um so that our citizens will be
 
00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
practice um so that our citizens will be
better

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
served uh there's a gentleman from the
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh Dental Board and we're kind of on the
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
same page and maybe just need some to
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
work on this a little bit to come up
 
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.150 align:start position:0%
work on this a little bit to come up
with

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
something that will be able to be
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
helpful and with that I'll end my
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
testimony and take questions thank you
 
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and representative

PR how are you good to see you again
brother

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
brother
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe to help you out a bit uh we've
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
had this discussions in in the past we
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
both lived it and that is with EMTs and
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
reciprocity Y and how that occurs uh
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
national standards and stuff do you see
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
any coralation here where any of those
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
like particular particular models so I I
 
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
would I would think there would be some
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
of that you have to look at where
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
they're coming from and do they meet our
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
standards or whatever and I understand
 
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.149 align:start position:0%
standards or whatever and I understand
the

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh National Dental Board is kind of
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
strict on that so maybe we need to work
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
on them a little bit but uh I'm not sure
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
how we would do that but yes reciprocity
 
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
and and our
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
licensing um I know I I
 
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
a few years ago I had brought something
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
about dental
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
hygienist um there was a class uh
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
there's a school in in Worcester that
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
does dental
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
hygiene and this person lived in New
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wanted to get licensed in New
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and her friends went to
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they were licensed in like
 
00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.670 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they were licensed in like
48

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
48
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hours here in New Hampshire it was two
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
to three weeks or even longer before
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
they could get the license had to jump
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
through a bunch of Hoops that down in
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts didn't have to and I'm
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
like how did that happen usually we're
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be easier but Massachusetts
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
is is easier so all those people that
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
were were kind of thinking about coming
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire went to Massachusetts
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
instead so I think overall we need to
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
look at that whole board and their
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
licensing and how we get can get more
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
people to come to our state instead of
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
other states um representative PR you
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
may be interested to know that there was
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
a performance audit of the Dental Board
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
I believe two years ago now and they
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
have made significant progress in
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
accelerating their licenses so excellent
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
this this problem had been identified by
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of other people representative
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
laus um
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's problem probably after he's done
 
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody here from oplc who
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
can speak on her I think I have a
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
better any other questions for
 
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
better any other questions for
representative

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
pro thank you thank you for your
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
HS such a strange
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
environment good morning Douglas
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
oplc uh I think you're right
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative I think we have made
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
great strides in
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
um how fast we can process licenses over
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
the last few years um one of my points
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
today I I have a couple of points on
 
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
this bill I think there's a little bit
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
of ambiguity in some of the language the
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
office doesn't take a position but
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's ambiguity as the term terms such
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
as limited license um I think there
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit of redundancy when
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
you compare this bill to the language of
 
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.509 align:start position:0%
you compare this bill to the language of
RSA

00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
317a 20 Roman numeral 3 parentheses B
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
which provides for students for
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
commission on Dental
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
accreditation uh to practice in
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals or other institutions based on
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
the testimony we just heard I'm not sure
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
if that was the intent but but there is
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
that uh 22 CFR 62.
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
22 um also is about the exchange visitor
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
programs um from individuals educated
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
from other countries uh and then one of
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
the main reasons I came up today was
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
just to point out some of the conflicts
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
with RSA 310 namely RSA 3104 um this
 
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
bill would give the board the ability to
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
process licenses it's a 655 310 issue um
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
the same with um I do want to point out
 
00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
the same with um I do want to point out
the

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
one of the big steps we made last year
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
was in House Bill 594 which created RSA
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
31017 we talk about this bill a lot I
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
think representative lakas alluded to it
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's the uh reciprocity and endorsement
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
bill that gives the oplc the authority
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
to Draft rules for lure endorsement in
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
the State uh we have interum rules in
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
place there is a I believe a public
 
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
we've we've submitted an initial
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
proposal for uh regular Ru making on PLC
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
313 and we have a public hearing on
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
March 7th and then we're trying to hope
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
to get to Jael car by April um and
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
dentists being a priority were one of
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
the first 13 boards addressed
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
in uh the interim
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
role all right thank you could you tell
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
say again which RSA describes the
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
the limit well I think that the limited
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
license term is
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
ambiguous well excuse me you cited an
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
RSA that said might be applicable oh oh
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
I'm okay uh proposed language um RSA
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
317-a colon
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
20 Roman numeral 3 parentheses
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
B and that's the
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh it provides students from the
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
commission on Dental accreditation
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
accredited schools to practice in
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals or other institution under the
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
supervision of a faculty member right
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay uh and then there's the
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
exchange visitor program that was 22 CFR
 
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
section 62.2 two that sounds like a
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation that we don't have
 
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.790 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation that we don't have
much

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
Authority all right thank you very much
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
other questions representative laus and
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
and then O'Brien and then M py thank you
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
you um so on the proposed Ru making uh
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
two parts one is is anything in there
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
addressing uh foreign
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
dentists and and also uh is there
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
hygienists so when we interpret 31017 it
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
just says a jurisdiction outside of New
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we interpret that to mean all
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions so whether it's
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
another state whether it's a foreign
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
country you would have to meet those
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
substantially similar requirements so
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
they might not be specifically addressed
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
but the requirements would be the same
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
because they're out of state um dental
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
hygienist if it's a licensed type it
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
would be in the
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
313 thank you O'Brien thank you madam
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
chair um I would like to go on record as
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
a dauntless defender of anybody that
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
goes to our own particular uh
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
educational to get certified
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
and everything but I do also support the
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocity end of it uh can you give me
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
like a ballp what your guesstimation
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
would be I mean is there a void that
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be filled with people from
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
another country that are certified to
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
jobs and I'm not going to hold you to a
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
particular number I'm looking again a
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
ballp you know I think anytime there's a
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage which we've
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
identified it's pretty common knowledge
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
it's nice to get a qualified individual
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
from anywhere we can get
 
00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.670 align:start position:0%
from anywhere we can get
them

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh I also think for this legislation we
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
have the mechanisms in place because of
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
31017 where we can do some rule writing
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
and make sure we can get those qualified
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state without
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
language and follow up if I may Madam
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
chair in doing
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
so would that be up to the particular
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
employer or to the board uh to determine
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
that in other words would they need a
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh to know that these people
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
going to have a uh employment in that
 
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:27.509 align:start position:0%
going to have a uh employment in that
related

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:32.470 align:start position:0%
related
field

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
I think that goes beyond the scope of
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
what I can answer for
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
lure okay adequate enough thank you
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
madam represent man
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh two parts with the
 
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.710 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh two parts with the
licensing

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.069 align:start position:0%
licensing
RSA

00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
317-a that you referred to about
 
00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
317-a that you referred to about
alternative

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
licensing does it have two paths
 
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
experience as well as
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
education or it's just experience
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
qualified I would I don't have the
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
language in front of me I would need to
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
have that language before I could answer
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
that adequately a followup
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
follow I
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
can kind of look at it from the India
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
perspective the professional education
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
can happen after 12 years of K through
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
12 and get into med school or
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
dentistry in this country you have to
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
have undergrad so you get short of those
 
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
three years and that happened to me in
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
my profession so there are
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
educational evaluation ones so has New
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire incorporate there are
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
designated educational assessment ones
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
that look at number of hours in the
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
professional field so that's something I
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
don't know off the top of my head but if
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
we look at the initial proposal for PLC
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
313 we'll be able to see the the
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
qualifications for somebody from another
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction coming in and we could get
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
the answer from there I just without it
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
in front of me I couldn't answer that
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
just thank you m representing
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
broa thank you Madame chair so
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
um setting aside the fact that we don't
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
have a limited license we don't have
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
that defined in
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
statute and we have conditional licenses
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
which we created for something similar
 
00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.230 align:start position:0%
which we created for something similar
to

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
this um and the fact that the board
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't issue licenses any
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
longer um are we saying that with 3 uh
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
17 with RSA 317 we have a
 
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.190 align:start position:0%
17 with RSA 317 we have a
enough

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um Authority with oplc that they could
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
that they could review this and possibly
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
Grant someone a license in this
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
RSA yeah I'm I'm looking at it too I'm
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
just want to know what
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
he oh RSA
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
317 I would need to see that so the way
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
we would do it right now is if an app if
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
you were licensed in another
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and application come in we
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
would process that license under the PLC
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
313 the
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
313 uh RSA 31017 has not withstanding
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
language so essentially that gave the
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
executive director in consultation with
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
the Abo's authority to promulgate rules
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
regarding Lure by reciprocity or
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
endorsement so those rules could reflect
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
37 a20 but without the language in front
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
of me I I'm kind of hesitant to answer
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
any questions about it
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
you if you are looking at that you would
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
also consider the exemption for a health
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
care charitable trust because looking at
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that such an entity
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
could set up a not for-profit dental
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
clinic and hire whomever they
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
pleased and I'd like to have that
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
have you look at that if that is in fact
 
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.310 align:start position:0%
have you look at that if that is in fact
the

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
case I can take a look at it okay thank

1331 the nhds greatly appreciates the
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
efforts of rep PR uh to examine an
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
Innovative approach to our ongoing
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage uh New Hampshire is
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
one of the few states in the Northeast
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
in which dentists and dental
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
professionals are seeking to move doing
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
no small part to our strong economy and
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
exceptional quality of life however
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
according to a number of reports we've
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
received over the last few years uh the
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh the time it takes for dental
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
professionals to obtain their licenses
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh has made it problematic for dentists
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
and dental professionals uh move to
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
Granite State such obstacles only
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the ongoing uh care shortage
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
and access to care some uh new patients
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
have to wait up to a year uh to be seen
 
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
by a dentist due to this Workforce
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
shortage HB 1331 along with many of the
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
other bills that you've just discussed
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
um has promise as an Innovative approach
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh there are a number of issues that
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
this bill as as has previously indicated
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are some issues that uh impact its
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
viability and Effectiveness if it is
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
passed as is for example the bill does
 
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
not provide criteria for the licenses or
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
scope of prati address the scope of
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
practice issues uh that has been
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned I believe that working
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
together with the oplc this body uh the
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners and oral
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
health stakeholders uh these issues can
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
be addressed down the road the nhds is
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
working with oplc and the board of
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
dental examiners to find ways to improve
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
the current licensing system and there
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
have been some improvements uh we're
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
also working with legislators like you
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
the governor and oral health
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to find new ways to
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
to recruit Dental professionals to the
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
state at the same time we must be
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
willing to explore Innovative short-term
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
Solutions until those problems those
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
longer term problems are
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
addressed including that which uh refr
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
proposes here today in light of these
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
points the nhds uh would recommend that
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
this bill be placed into interm study uh
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
so that we can better re examine and
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
remedy the issues that we just discussed
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further any
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.950 align:start position:0%

microphone sorry do you know uh do we
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
have American dentists who are finding
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
it difficult to obtain employment in non
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
us countries that this could be
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
reciprocity uh fixed for are you aware
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
of any of those cases uh thank you for
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
the question I'm not sure if I have the
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
answer to that I know that currently uh
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
the American Dental Association is
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
working with the foresight Institute in
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh Cambridge Massachusetts to create a
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
broader network of international
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
dentists and researchers but I don't
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
know the reciprocity issues going to
 
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.269 align:start position:0%
know the reciprocity issues going to
other

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
countries represent man py thank you
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair um does this in lack of uh
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
qualified dentists to practice in New
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does it tie in with any since
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
we don't have a dental school in the
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
state does that bring a big uh
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
challenge thank you for the question and
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very uh relevant point
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
that we do not have a dental school here
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we only have one
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
training program uh for hygiene and
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's producing uh just a smaller
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
percentage of the actual uh students
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be Gra graduating uh we
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
do work with the University of New
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
England as uh sort of a feeder School
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents as well as
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine uh residents would go
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
to those schools and ideally come back
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
but as you point out um many of the
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
professionals who are graduating from
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
dental school they go on to a residency
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
and we only have one residency just
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
brand new here in the State uh which you
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
know if they go to Boston or someplace
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
else for a residency they might stay
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
there so that's a very real concern of
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
ours okay well let be on the scope of
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe I believe so yes any
 
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.269 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe I believe so yes any

um going into executive session
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
representative leus do you have a motion
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
I do uh itl on 1331 I'll
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
second all right do you wish to speak to
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
um it's I mean I don't think doing this
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
special case just for Dennis of a new
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
license type is really the way to go um
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
you know we need to look
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
at how well what we've done last year
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
has worked and if there are specific
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
problems on uh Dentistry I asked before
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
we started today I asked representative
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
PR to send me some details on what the
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
problems are and um my plan if he did
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
that was to take them to the oplc
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and try and get some
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
answers there and see if it can be
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
resolved if there is still a problem um
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
without legislation so thank I think at
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
this point itl's the best on this
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
representa yes thank you um I think that
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
representative luus um address some of
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
my cons some of my the same points I
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
would have made and also this bill
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
really is not reflective of the changes
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
that we made last year and so for that
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
reason I agree with the itl
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
motion anyone else have a comment
 
00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:26.190 align:start position:0%

discussion repr Bailey it was suggested
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
study I can that we could if we don't do
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
not vote for the itl we can vote for
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
interm study but if the Dental
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
Association is already working with the
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
oplc to resolve some
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
issues I'm just as happy to let them
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
deal with it themselves and let let us
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
consider what they come up
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.430 align:start position:0%
consider what they come up
with

00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and just following I agree
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
with that and following on um you know
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
there is the oplc oversite committee we
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
can bring it there and raise the issue
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
and kind of keep an eye on how well what
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
we did last year uh helps resolve you
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
know this
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
problem or the one that led to this bill
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to say I'd rather not
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
create a new license type for very
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
narrow slice of applic
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm stred with this anyone else
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative G I agree Madam chair
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
with what you just said and especially
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
um that we have the ability to already
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
employ these people through the other
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms described all right thank you
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
represent man py thank you madam chair I
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
agree there is a lot more to
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
International uh Ed internationally
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
educated uh individuals to be licensed
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so this only focuses on
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
one narrow and I think more
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
deeper issue of how do
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
we include or
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
welcome other outside Educators
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
different paths would be a more prudent
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
one and for that I think I agree with
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
the it thank you right thank you anyone
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
without a vehicle uh as
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
our without this bill as a vehicle so I
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote for the it as well all
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%

roart thank you Adam chair uh members of

the committee I'm my name is David
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
Rochford I'm representing Grafton one um
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the beautiful town of Littleton New
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I come to you with uh a
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill HB
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
1222 and
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
um let me grab I think I might have
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
handed out my notes to somebody oh here
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
we go uh so first thing I want to I want
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
to do is is clarify a couple things that
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
I know have been swirling around that
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
have caused some consternation and some
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
worry and uh I just want to kind of set
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
the record straight here um one thing
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
that hb1 1222 does if you look at the
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
act the the title it's relative to
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
physician assistance scope of practice
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
and um one of the things if you read the
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't really change the scope
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
of practice Physicians assistants will
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
still be doing what they do now uh they
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
won't be doing anything more than what
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
they do now uh and you know certainly
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
won't be um practicing outside of what
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
their current training in so what it
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
what we really do when you boil the the
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill down is it uh you
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
know it it C focuses really on the
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping required for physicians
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
assistant to to do that the other thing
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's been circling around that I want
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify is this bill 100% came from
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents who happens to be
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
a physician's assistant you have a
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
letter there from her uh she would would
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
have gladly come to this meeting and
 
00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:03.079 align:start position:0%
testified but the important thing to
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
realize is that she's booked out two
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
months ahead of time so she were to
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
cancel her meetings or or appointments
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
she's in such demand and there's such a
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
shortage of primary care providers in
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
the North Country everywhere in in fact
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
it would have set her back two months
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
and she would have had to take these
 
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
people who need her and told them that
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
come back in two months so she wishes
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
she was here she sent in a letter I I
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
distributed that letter um for her uh so
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
you can see the other thing that um the
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
third thing before we kind of get into
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
you know more of my testimony is we also
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
have are asking for an amendment uh as
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
we as we have submitted the bill my
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor has been U very um um uh very
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
helpful in that and what the and that
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
has been emailed to you we per I forgot
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
to get the copies to submit to uh um
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
house committee services to circulate
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
despite all the other things I gave you
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
to circulate that was not one of them
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
but when if you check your email you'll
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
see that it's uh Amendment um 20250
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
0454 um it is it has been circulated I
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
think did we get a copy we've we've got
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
some copies I think M Clayman is going
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
to bring out hard copies to distribute
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
committee so at at the Crux of the
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
amendment it really defines what
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration is and redefines it and
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the the definition on the
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
books right now collaboration means a
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
physician's assistance consultation with
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
or referral to an appropriate physician
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
other or other health care professional
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
this then changes that to collaboration
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
means a physician's assistant
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
consultation with or referral to the
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate member of The healthc Care
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
team when reality it's it's really
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's who that's who physicians
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
assistant should be referring to if
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
there's a if there's a question of
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
consultation it should be the most
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate member of The healthc Care
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
team um and and that may not be a
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
physician um which we're going to get
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get into a little bit
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
further uh the other thing that the
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
amendment does is you if you look down
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
on there uh page one lines 19 through 24
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
it really defines the criteria uh of of
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
Licensing lure for those traveling
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
Physicians or Physicians working within
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
the VA medical system uh and it requires
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
a collaboration with a uh um someone
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
within the state now I felt like this is
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
not necessary and uh for the in the
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
committee can certainly talk this up but
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
but remember as we recall last year um
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
we passed a bill the governor signed it
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
that increased the portability of
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
license sure uh around the country so a
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
a a healthcare provider who holds a
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
license in another state can get a
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire um relatively
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
easy as long as the qualifications uh
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
for lure are similar and I and I've
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
circulated the qualifications for
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
licensure and the materials that I sent
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
um and then the change in line 28 of
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
that page again is more uh along along
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
those lines so that's the amendment that
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
you have before it just kind of gives a
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
little more completeness to the bill um
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
and and again this bill was came the the
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this bill was a constituent a
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
constituent that has a practice a very
 
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
busy practice obviously in the North
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
Country uh she's a physician's assistant
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
a long-standing physician's assistant
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
and uh it came to the point where uh she
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
had a collaborative as as the law states
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
now uh Physicians assistants have to
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
have a collaborative practice agreement
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
with a a physician and if you look at at
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
the law there's nothing more than that
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's required than a signature on a
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
piece of paper um you know this the law
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
the state does a very good job
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
separating liability from that
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
supervising physician so so the
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
physician's assistant is still
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
responsible legally um but at the end of
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
the day they have to get that signature
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
and it sounds simple that we have a
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
signature but in many cases this
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
signature just putting a name on a piece
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
of paper is costing $1,000 a month
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
upward of $1,000 doll a month just to
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
put a name on a piece of paper to
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
accommodate the law for Physicians
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
assistants to do what they're trained to
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
do for them to take the legal liability
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
completely take the legal liability but
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
we have this little little part of our
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
law that says a signature has to be uh
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
on a piece of paper so this removes that
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
this allows Physicians assistants to
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
practice within their scope to practice
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
within their training to see patients
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and to see uh uh to treat members of the
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
community and that's of a particular
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
concern in urgency right now because
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
there's a drastic shortage of primary
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
care providers it wasn't only a year and
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
a half ago where we saw headlines uh
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
where the largest Health Care system in
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire was no longer
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
taking Primary Care patients they were
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
maxed out they were full they didn't
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
have enough providers to take care of
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
the people in this area with the without
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
mentioning names I mean it's a it treats
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
it treats a lot of people in the state
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so we've talked about
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
you know I I've circulated some
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
information about training uh a phys I
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
looked at the in the concern are they do
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
they have adequate training to do this
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
again this is just removing a signature
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
on a piece of paper the state already
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
says they have adequate training but
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
just to put it into perspective
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistance right down the
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
road at Massachusetts College of
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and Health Sciences you can go
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
online and look at it there's a
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
comparison of their training Physicians
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
assistance training versus other types
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
of mid-level practitioner Physicians
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
assistants have 111 hours of class time
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
training plus a residency clinical
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
residency um other mid-level
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
practitioners have much less than that
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
um other states are doing this removing
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
this requirement for collaboration
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
Wyoming Utah North Dakota are leading
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
leading the way um I was I was really
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
tried to find is there any increase in
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
safety is there any increase in Risk to
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
the patient and the public there's been
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
nothing reported there's not a dramatic
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
increase of uh of of of Adverse Events
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
in these states um the other thing I
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
want to point out is we have I believe
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
we have two schools in New Hampshire
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
that are uh graduating physicians
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
assistant program graduating students
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
from the Physicians assistance program
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
you you add that with the dramatic need
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have for Primary Care uh providers
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
think about just South of the Border in
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they have a much more
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
generous and much more open ability for
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
these mid-level practitioners to
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
practice so we're losing these graduates
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
across across the border these are all
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
people that could be treating people in
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by by enacting this bill
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
h1222 it's my thought uh in even you
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
know some off off the record
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
conversations with people from these
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
schools that that would be a a a an
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
ability to retain some of these folks in
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire make it more attractive to
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
set up a practice in New Hampshire to to
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
treat people in New Hampshire
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going I'm going to talk about
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
two more things then I'm going to then
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to shut my mouth one of the
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
things that we always want to talk about
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
is unfounded fears and I I I implore the
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
committee to really dig into some of
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
these unfounded fears you know my
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
profession I'm a pharmacist and a number
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
of years ago uh we were here in front of
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
this committee talking about
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacist's ability to give flu shots
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
of all things and uh there were a lot of
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
people that showed up and talked about
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
how this is a horrible thing for the
 
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
community that the that the pharmacists
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
were going to give flu shots and it's
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
going to be so dangerous and they don't
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
have the training they're not
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate for it but now you look at
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
fast forward just a few years later
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacists give more vaccines than
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
anyone and as a member of the Board of
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy in my seven years we've had one
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
complaint of an adverse event with a
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
pharmacist uh giving a flu shot so
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
really I I implore the committee to dig
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
into the fears um really parse out is
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
this a genuine vetted evidence-based
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
fear or is a Turf War because I think
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we might hear
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
after are concerns about a Turf War and
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
I implore the committee to to to to
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
Really press into uh the fears is it is
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
it a founded fear because again I I I
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
looked I I tried to find some data that
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
would justify that and maybe it's out
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
there and maybe I looked at the wrong
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
place but I just couldn't find it so um
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to I'll ask
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
questions my co-sponsor is here and uh I
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
know that he'd like to speak on this
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
topic as
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you repres we do have a few
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
questions rep representative
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair uh first
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
question uh Dr oser uh is um where is
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
that up to
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
th000 a month where's that
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
go well so this came to me from a person
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
who is close to this they're close to
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
the physician's assistant in this
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
particular circumstance um this was a
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
physician located in Pennsylvania but
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
through the compact licensing agreements
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
that we have with other states um the
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
physician in Pennsylvania could obtain a
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
phys a license in New Hampshire so
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
therefore they could qualify under the
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
law that that that that they did that
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge this was a per a
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
revenue source for this
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
individual kind of a unique business
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
model so uh that's yeah that's that's
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
how it was related to me thank you
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
followup follow up so uh as you know uh
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
Advanced nurse practitioners are doing a
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
lot of medical work uh in New Hampshire
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
already uh would you say that Physicians
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
assistants are very comply trained with
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
Advanced nurse
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
arpn um uh with regard to their
 
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
usefulness in the thing I've been
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
treated by arpn on a number of in
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
occasions great results they knew
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
exactly what they were doing I got
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
exactly the treatment I needed and so
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
forth so I'm fine with that especially
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
since we have a a need how are the
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants whom I've also
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
experienced several times uh how are
 
00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
they in terms of training comparable yes
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so like
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
you I'm a big supporter of Physicians uh
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners my daughter's a
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
nurse uh my wife's primary care provider
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
is a nurse practitioner my wife actually
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
has a complex heart condition that the
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner handles uh quite
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
adequately um you know I think it's
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
important to realize what Physicians
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
assistants are doing now in this state
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh my young my middle daughter the first
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
day of school or freshman year she
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
trained all summer long for soccer to
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
try out for the varsity soccer team um
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
her first day of school her freshman
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
year she br broke her foot and uh we
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
went to the we went to the orthopedic
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
center we never saw a physician but we
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
saw a physician's assistant and this
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
physician assistant really put a very
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
good personalized care plan together um
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
we saw her every week uh we had some
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
therapy all coordinated by the
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
physician's assistant uh you know my
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
daughter wasn't supposed to be able to
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
get back on her foot loadbearing until
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving uh through the care that
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
she got from the physician's assistant
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
she played in the last soccer game of
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
the year uh which is a playoff game so
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
you know as far as care goes I
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
personally would I do trust my family to
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
care of both nurse practitioners and
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants um you know one of
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
the things that I gave you and and I'm
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
not putting down nurse practitioner
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
again my my daughter's a nurse but you
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
know when when you start looking at the
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
data and you start looking at really
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
founded fears versus unfounded fears one
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
of the concern one of the things that we
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
brought up is you know um and you have
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
this while nurse practitioners May
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
obtained 500 to 700 hours of experience
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
in clinical learning about diagnostic
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
techniques common medical procedures and
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
case managers Physicians assistants are
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
required to spend almost 2,000 hours in
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
clinical environment prior to licensing
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
so I mean there's not a you know it's is
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
the training model is different actually
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
in fact the training model for
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants MIM mimics as I
 
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
understand Physicians um so I I I I
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
think that we're you know again I going
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
back to personally I would personally
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know feel very comfortable uh with
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
either mid-level practitioner for
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
treatment with my
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
family representive
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um I see um
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
the language particularly in the
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
amendment talks about um previously the
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
part that's scratched out says
 
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.710 align:start position:0%
part that's scratched out says
appropriate

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
physician uh for referral and it just
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
changes the language to the appropriate
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
member of the health care team but I
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
don't see any definition of what that
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
to well I think I'd go back to the
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
original scratched out part I mean
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate was is in the law now um so
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is that is defined in the law and I
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
would imagine that and again I'm I'm I'm
 
00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:52.599 align:start position:0%
I'm imagining that it's probably you
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
know these these practitioners these
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
licensed IND individuals report to
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
licensing boards and the licensing
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
boards um uh examine standard of care
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
and what's appropriate for practice uh
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's it's not defined in
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
law I believe in this case but I think
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
it's referred back to the the licensing
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
boards the jury of their peers if they
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
will to determine what's appropriate and
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
what's not and if you look at that you
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
know the changing from appropriate
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
physician or other healthc care
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
professional to the appropriate member
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the healthcare team really reflects
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the the evolution that we've
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
experienced in healthc care uh over the
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
last 30 or 40 years you know for
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
instance you know my own profession as a
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
pharmacist if we're dosing you know if
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
if if a provider be a physician's
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
assistant or even a physician needs to
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
dose an I apologize for the technical
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
terms but an aminoglycoside antibiotic
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
the appropriate member of the healthcare
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
team to to to figure out the dosing of
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
that isn't physician it would be a a
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
pharmacist a clinical pharmacist in that
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
point um yeah absolutely and my
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor can add to that uh I'd like
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
to pick up on that I'm representative
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
Jess Edwards representing Rockingham
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
District 31 I'm happy to be a co-sponsor
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh to to try to uh answer
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
your your question with a little more
 
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.870 align:start position:0%
your your question with a little more
legal

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
specificity uh This this term to the
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate member of The healthc Care
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
team really establishes in the law uh
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
the obligation of the PA to do what the
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
pa would normally do and that is to
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
manage the care of the patient and to re
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
make the referrals
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
necessary uh historically because of the
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement the term
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
physician had been hardwired into the
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
law because the PA would would be
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
subjected or uh sub yeah subjected to
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
the authority and discretion of the
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
physician what this is doing because
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're moving more into an independent
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
practice and freeing the PA up from the
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
ties what we're what what this does is
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
it essentially
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
establishes um the um the uh the kind of
 
00:53:16.119 --> 00:53:17.109 align:start position:0%
establishes um the um the uh the kind of
the

00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
malpractice law so that if a PA
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
mismanages a patient and does not do a
 
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
proper referral to say a
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
dermatologist to a Cardiologist to you
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
know whoever is in the integrated
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
healthc care team if the PA doesn't do
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
that right and there's harm to the
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
patient this language is basically the
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
umbrella that uh that they can be held
 
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.190 align:start position:0%
umbrella that uh that they can be held
accountable

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
under also this language came from a PA
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
this came from um what what what what we
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
did was after we did the the the
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
original Bill we continued to staff it
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
and get additional input and so we we we
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
ended up with a very senior PA who um
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
who pointed out that tying the PA to The
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
Physician would no longer be the right
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
way to go that it would be better to to
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
to create the relationship in law to the
 
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.270 align:start position:0%
to create the relationship in law to the
healthcare

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
team and followup question um I also so
 
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
see um on the original Bill line 15 phys
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
assistants are solely responsible for
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
the care they
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
provide um do they have access to the
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
same malpractice insurance that
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
situation there's someone like a later
 
00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
speaker will says he's an able to answer
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
that question properly yeah so so the
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
the short answer is the PA when working
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
under a collaborative agreement is also
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
subjected to the malpractice
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
insurance of the physician that's
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for the care because we're
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
reestablishing the
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
relationship the PA would need to go
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
obtain their own
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
insurance what what with this with this
 
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
what the big concept here is is that uh
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
since nurse practitioners and PAs were
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
established in the late 60s early 70s uh
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
they have sort of developed in on
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
Parallel paths and in different states
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
the autonomy of one relative to the
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
other has varied like in the in Nebraska
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
physician assistants were extremely
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
autonomous rather quickly because of the
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
rural nature of Nebraska and the needs
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
there and nurse practi practitioners
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
tended to stay in the heavy clinical
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
environments um like the medical centers
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
and and so the characteristics between
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
these two professions varies by the
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
culture of the state in New Hampshire uh
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
what we've had is the nurse
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
practitioners have done a better job I
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
think at working the legislature to get
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
the autonomy and the scope of practice
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
Freedom that Pas have not and so this is
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
really an effort to uh make these two
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
professions equivalent and they really
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
are from an academic and clinical
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
perspective um and to create more
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility in our health care System to
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
help address some of the underlying
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
problems we're having with
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
Manpower thank you representative maputi
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.670 align:start position:0%
taking my
question

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
Pas can practice independently have a
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
private practice whereas or sorry the
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
other way around AR aprns can have a
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
private practice independently practice
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
whereas PA still need to be under an
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
umbrella which carries the malpractice
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
correct mostly yes I mean PA still have
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
to have their own liability insurance
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
even today right now um but yes uh nurse
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
practitioners can
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
freely set up practice move around the
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
state uh you know whereas Pas are always
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
tied at least by paper to an overseeing
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
physician uh
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you other questions represent
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
Gould thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
question one one of your statements that
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
really stood out for me was turf wars
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
and just quickly and and also
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards your talk about
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
um unique cultures in various States and
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'm aware in my research for I'm a
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
genealogist and I was writing a book and
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
there was a family that lived in
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
Claremont and Bradford New Hampshire the
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
father was the product of a mixed
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
marriage of a revolutionary war soldier
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
that came over from England and married
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
an iroy woman and they bore a child so
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
they went back to England she died the
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
boy was raised by his English parents
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
and went to the finest schools and was
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
trained as a doctor came back to the
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
States and decided to go to his iroy
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
parents uh Mother's um tribe and learn
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
the medicine of the native people he
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
bore five children he he practiced both
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
forms of medicine he bore five children
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
four sons and one daughter they all
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
practiced medicine they were all
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
licensed Physicians including his
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
daughter in the late 18 early
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
1900s the three doctors practicing in
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
clam Newbury and Bradford New Hampshire
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
practiced both types Patients Preferred
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
to go to both the the uh a professional
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
association for physicians in Boston
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
brought suit against them to stop them
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
from being able to practice native
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
medicine and lost and it was a Turf War
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
it was strictly a Turf War it didn't win
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
then it's the culture of New Hampshire
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
how do you find the turf war playing out
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you want yeah
 
00:59:29.559 --> 00:59:30.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you want yeah
go

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
ahead so I'm a little older from a
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
legislative background I was on HHS EA
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
on my first committee uh four terms ago
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
and um uh we saw then in bills trying to
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
introduce um um different types of
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
Health Care providers that the
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
constituencies of the Physicians and the
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
nurse practition partitioners and the
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
like uh uh came out and um uh opposed
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that allowed uh an you know
 
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
Affiliated and Associated health care
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
provider Community to to get more
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
autonomy there's there's I think I think
 
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
we have a history here in the
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
legislature of opposition and most of it
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
is is is well intentioned we're trying
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
to protect the safety that's why we do
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
all of this right um but you know I
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
think if we were to take a look at it
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
from a slightly different perspective
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes what you see is the use of Law
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
and restrictions as as potential
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
barriers to entry and the kind of the
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
protection of of of of of turf it's it's
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
probably there's probably better terms
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
but but that's really kind of what it is
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes and I don't know who's going
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill um and I don't want
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
to speakers that are going to present
 
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
yeah testimony and opposition yeah um
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
but I but I do think it's time for us to
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
make equivalent Health Care professions
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
equivalent functionally in law so that
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
we can increase the flexibility in our
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
health care System to meet some of our
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
needs thank you and thank you madam
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%

complaints filed against physician
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
assistants as well as doctors are they
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
on equal par with the knowledge of you
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
know what I mean is there easy ability

to look up adverse um customer
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
complaints as it were yeah that would be
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
a question for the Board of Medicine
 
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
that's where that that's where that lies
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
um you know and and I know that you know
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
I'm on a different board we have a
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
different way as as you know there
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
there's been some questions on how those
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
are handled over there uh so I don't
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
have an answer for you on that I don't I

you uh my name is uh Nick penovich I'm
 
01:02:53.309 --> 01:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
um retired semi-retired uh General and
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
vascular surgeon practi RAC and
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
conquered for 25 some years um I still
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
interact with medical students at
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth I teach pretty much every
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
other day in conquered and up up in
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and I also interact a lot with
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
Pas and nurse practitioners at least in
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
conquered I'm a surgeon so the students
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm teaching are Dartmouth students who
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
in their third year taking their core
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
rotation so they come to conquer they've
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
been coming to conquered for about 14
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
years and uh it's mostly didactic
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
teaching bedside teaching but to make it
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
happen I deal with Pas and I deal with
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners who work within the
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
hospital setting and uh prior to that
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
when I quit operating in
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
2013 um for a good decade I had nurse
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
practitioners and PAs mostly Pas working
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
on the surgical service they are both
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
invaluable resources it was mentioned by
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
the sponsors and I learned a lot from
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
the sponsors uh I thought both their
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
presentations were excellent um I've
 
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
learned that they are really incredible
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
L important yes PA got started about
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
1965 it was a Duke Duke Medical Center I
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
guess the hospital maybe the med school
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
created the idea and for over 50 years
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
we've had uh pas in the state and
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
there's no question they do an amazing
 
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
job when I do my job now I'm contacting
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
them always trying to find the best
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
patience for teaching I get more
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
information from that than I get from my
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
former surgical colleagues beyond the
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
doubt um I'm opposed to this bill
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
mainly because I don't want to restrict
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
what they do because what they do is
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
terrific and I'm not I'm not worried
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
about them going into an operating room
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
and starting their own operating rooms I
 
01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's going to happen I
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
don't think they want that to happen by
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
the way the most popular PA when Pas
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
decide what area of medicine they're
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
going into the most popular one is
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
surgery and and and the fact that I get
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
the interact with them I understand
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
they're pretty happy group despite being
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
on night call and so
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
forth uh the main reason I'm opposing
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
this is from another part of my past
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
history so
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
um in 20120 I was in 2000 I was
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
president of medical staff at conquered
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
hospital and there were some things that
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do from the stpoint of
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
self-help for doctors that we needed
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
cleared with the Board of Medicine and
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
let's put it this way it took me about
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
17 years to get off the Board of
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
Medicine I went off in 2019 so I had
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
various jobs there member of the board
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
medical of the former medical review
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for about 25 years we've
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
had a physician investigator that
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
disappeared with the medical review
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
commit last summer but um I got to see
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
how the board work and U one of the
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
representatives asked a question can you
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
know um just recently can you know about
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
complaints against Pas and the answer is
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
U any complaint claim or lawsuit whether
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's a PA or MD the Board of Medicine is
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
MDS dos who we consider in this state
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
the same and Physicians assistance and
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
they've been there for 50 years with the
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
do's and the MDS and the main reason
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
that is is because they've always had a
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
supervising that was the term physician
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
and a collaborative physician it wasn't
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
a team at that point it was an
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
individual name it's still is as far as
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
I know again I went off the board in
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
2019 four or five years ago um so when
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
complaints came in they often had the
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
PA's name sometimes the supervising
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
position wasn't there lawsuits were a
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
little more sophisticated an attorney
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
would dig up and find out from the board
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
who the supervising Physicians was so
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
that claimer lawsuit often had both
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
names on it and then an investigation
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
would happen and that complaint lwuit an
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
information that the board got didn't
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
didn't go public that there was a
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
complaint in but it did go public if
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
there was ever discipline of any kind so
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of information from the
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
board about what what went to
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
discipline um if a complaint or lawsuit
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
was um a settlement a settlement
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
happened uh let's say it was a hospital
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
PA with a supervising phys that didn't
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
go to the board um at all and I don't
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
think still does but may in the future
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
some states do require settlement
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
information to
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
go um
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
so all those years I was on the board um
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
and there was always a PA member on the
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
board and there still is um we would
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
hunt down the supervising position to
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
get their response and sometimes that
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
supervising position knew nothing about
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
the complaint they weren't around they
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
were out of town and the alternate might
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
have been out of town too but that group
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
that that physician worked for and it
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
was usually a group um someone stood up
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
and you could look at the records and
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
see that there was someone on call who
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
took over so the typical example of that
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
was if you go to any emergency room in
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
this state you're going to often see a
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
PA more than a nurse
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
practitioner and that that PA when that
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
that patient was interacted with you
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
could dig out and see who was in that
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
emergency room as an MD or do so that
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
name came up and that game came up to be
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the board when an
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
investigation happened and that's the
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
name that the malpractice attorneys
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
would dig up so that's the system that
 
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
we have now so hearing this today it
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
sounds like um I'm not sure there's
 
01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a usual a name there there's
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
going to be you know a team there and
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
then how does that happen and yes I know
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
that Pas have their own malpractice but
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
if you're a malpractice attorney and you
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
think something bad's happened you want
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
to have that Physician's name on it
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
because they have the deeper pocket and
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
if that phys disappears if that's what
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to do make it a
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
collaborative thing without a name um I
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
suspect the PA's um malpractice
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
insurance will go way up I would suspect
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
know or do they really need to be at the
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the main reason
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
they've been on the Board of Medicine
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
for 50 years that they've had the hab of
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
supervising in an alternative position
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
so if we're not going to have a name
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
there I guess Pennsylvania thousand
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
bucks to get your name there it's a
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
business I I've never saw that happen in
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
my 17 years there weren't Pas
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
complaining that they had to pay a th000
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
bucks to get a name on there
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
particularly from another state how do
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
you supervise from another state I don't
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
understand that so I've learned a lot
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
but I worry a lot and I think if this
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
passes maybe uh maybe the Pas need the
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
board um you know that may be the answer
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
because the Board of Medicine would have
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
no role anymore if you don't have to
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
have a PA or alternate
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
physician any questions for me I I love
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
I love working with them and nurse
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners uh nurse practitioners in
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
an outpatient setting are kind of a
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
different animal but that's not the
 
01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.110 align:start position:0%
different animal but that's not the
subject

01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
today thank you madam chair um you had
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you thought maybe um
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants would need their
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
own board if something like this were to
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
go through do I would hope do nurse
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
practitioners have their own
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
board under the Board of Nursing yes
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
okay so they're all under the Board of
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
Nursing and I don't know if there's
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
separate categories at the time I left
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
in 2019 there was not it was all gone
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
the bard of nursing so if there was any
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
complaint uh whether it was a nurse
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner Advanced nurse practitioner
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
a plain nurse it all went to the Board
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
of Nursing and they had a very different
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
structure than we did we had this huge
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
investigative committee which they never
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
had thank
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
oh representative Manti sorry thank you
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair quickly in terms of medical
 
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
board who are under Medical Board Pas uh
 
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
so there there's there's a bill out
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
there to change that and we won't get
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
into that but the current board has I
 
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
believe 11 members it has one doctor of
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
osteopathy do it has a PA it has three
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
public members I think they've had
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
trouble for many years getting three but
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's what's officiated three public
 
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
members then there's a design of the
 
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
Services um who's usually a physician
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
working in that department who sits on
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
the board and then the rest are MDS
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
basically and the MDS on the Board of
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
Medicine don't have to be in Specialties
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
different Specialties they can be in the
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
same specialty when medical review sub
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee which started in the mid 80s
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
and ended this year that was that was
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
about 11 or 12 people and it was also
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
very specifically picked for Specialties
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we had the most complaints and
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and claims about so we could do
 
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
our own investigation without extra
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
expense to the
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%

comments this morning uh I'll I'll
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
confess UPF front this is a little
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
awkward uh as a lobbyist uh and really
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
on for nispa uh to be here testifying on
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
a bill that as representative roord uh
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
alluded to was not our idea if you will
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh so in fact I hadn't I had only spoken
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
with representative Rochford once before
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
I saw this LSR pop in the fall and that
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
was at White Mountain paper and I can
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
assure you that we weren't talking about
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
pa uh collaboration agreements at White
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper and in gorum uh that day
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
um but but nonetheless here we are as I
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
understand it there was a uh and as he
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
explained there was a pa uh from his
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
district who spoke with him about this
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh the PA is not
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge affil at least certainly
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
not on the board of nispa I don't know
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
if if I think he said it was a a woman
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
is a member um and so we haven't lobbied
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill but nonetheless we're
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
having the discussion and here we are
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
today Madam chair and I'm happy to
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
provide some comments which I think May
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
clarify some of which some of what you
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard uh earlier so there are uh over a
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
thousand Pas here in New Hampshire uh
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
they work in every healthc care setting
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh and I think you've heard that if it's
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
in primary care emergency rooms surgical
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
centers uh and every specialty and subsp
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
specialy that that you can imagine um
 
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
and there are two PA schools one at the
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
mass College of Pharmacy the other at
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pierce University
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
um if I may Madam chair just a brief
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
history on maybe some of the legislative
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
Evolution legislative and Regulatory
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
evolution of PA practice a scope of
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
practice so uh as the previous speaker
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
alluded to when this profession started
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
I think and this is where the name came
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
from physician assistant and it's now
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
become a misnomer um they were
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
assistants to Physicians and so they
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
were uh they were supervised and that's
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
I think where that term came from but as
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
time has gone on and I think we all in
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
this room have seen uh pas are not
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
supervised anymore in a modern
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
Healthcare setting it's not like they're
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
a new server at a restaurant where you
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
have the manager following that new
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
server around everywhere they go uh
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's just not how it works they
 
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.590 align:start position:0%
that's just not how it works they
practice

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
independently uh they see patients
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
without anyone looking over their
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
shoulder they Direct Care they prescribe
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
meds Etc without any
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
supervision um we changed and to to
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
reflect the reality of modern Healthcare
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
teams uh this committee uh worked on a
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill two two years ago it was Senate
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 228 many of you were on the
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee at that time some of you
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
weren't but the brief history was the
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
goal of that Bill and that was supported
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh with and we appreciated that uh by
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
the medical society because it really
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
was just designed to um make sure our
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
statutes and now our regulations with
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
the revised Med 600 rules uh reflected
 
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
reality the reality of modern Healthcare
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
teams and we heard a little bit about
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
that prior so the law removed the term
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
supervisory or supervisor it took that
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
it took that concept out of Statute and
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
out of regulations because Pas are not
 
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
supervised um and it changed and so we
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
heard the reference to the RSP this
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
responsible supervisory physician form
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
that was just a piece of paper that a
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
physician had to sign and at the time
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
send into oplc where it sat in a file
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
cabinet um so the the thought was we
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't really that's that terminology is
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so what 22 what Senate Bill
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
228 did was it said it's really a
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement because all
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
members of a healthcare team collaborate
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
with one another uh as you heard the
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said he's a physician
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
he would often collaborate with Pas uh
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
when when appropriate and that's the
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's the training it's also the ethics
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
involved in those who practice medicine
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
is you always get help you always ask
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh and so that could be a PA
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
to a respiratory therapist it could be a
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
PA to a physician it could be any member
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
of a healthcare team speaking with
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
another member of the healthcare team it
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
could be physician to physician
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
if it's in the o or any other place a
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
primary care physician may need to speak
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
with a a specialist that happens all the
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
time it's common and it's it's you know
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's frankly required
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so Senate Bill 228 changed they
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
decided the concept of was to come up
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
with a collaboration agreement rather
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
than this responsible supervisory form
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
so it got rid of
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
supervisory in the collaboration
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
agreement the statute and I I do have a
 
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
copy of the specific um section of uh
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
328d that lays out the uh the
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of a collaboration
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
agreement but it states very clearly
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
that a PA must practice as one might
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
expect just like any other health care
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
provider within their training their
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
education and their experience and that
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
they always must collaborate with um the
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate I guess this amendment
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
said but a physician or other
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate member of the healthcare uh
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
Team I had not seen this amendment till
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
this morning so I'm not prepared to
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
comment on it um and that but the one
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
important difference and this is what
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
why we're here as why representative
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
rord brought the bill is
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
that that collaboration agreement still
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be signed by a physician a
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
licensed New Hampshire
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
physician now nurse practitioners the
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
and you know APRN the other mid-level
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
providers Pas are also mid-level
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
providers they don't have to have a
 
01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement they don't have
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
to have a a document signed by a
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
physician for them to practice medicine
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh pas do and that I think is Legacy
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
because back in the day if you will Pas
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
were supervised so we're kind of at a
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
point now where as uh representative
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
Edwards mentioned where it's a question
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
now of equity
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
um Pas have uh roughly and and in the
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
information I handed out and I I believe
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative Rochford mentioned this
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire if I and I you know
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just the lobbyist so if I'm
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect I apologize and I'll I'll
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
correct any mistakes that I make or
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
others behind me
 
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.550 align:start position:0%
others behind me
will

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
um NPS after 600 clinical hours can um
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
Can Begin practicing medicine uh and I
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
and in theory they can hang their own
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
shingle and begin you know their own
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
primary care practice or whatnot I don't
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
know that really happens very often at
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
all but it could Pas however uh they
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
have 2,000 clinical hours before they
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
graduate from their pa school so that's
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
three and a half times more yet uh for
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
the entirety of their career they could
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
be 30 years into a career they still
 
01:20:07.629 --> 01:20:07.639 align:start position:0%
have to have a piece of paper with a
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
signature on it from a doctor that
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
allows them to be able to practice
 
01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
allows them to be able to practice
medicine

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
um and again repres resulting excuse me
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
reflecting current medical team care and
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
and Health Care provision uh within a
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
health system or a primary care practice
 
01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.830 align:start position:0%
health system or a primary care practice
that

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
signature only states that the or the
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
law only states that it has to be signed
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
by a person who's affiliated with that
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
practice so these folks these doctors
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
can sign this it could be a doctor up in
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
Lebanon at Dartmouth Hitchcock signing a
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
a bunch of these collaboration
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
agreements for Pas who work all over the
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
state the PA never may never see that
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
person before before or after that
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
document is signed but the law says that
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
they have to be when they're practicing
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
there have there has to be a
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
physician uh part of that team who is
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
also available either in person or by
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
electronic means for consultation so it
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
can be and that's how a real team
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
functions so it's really just a piece of
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
paper that doctor I think a previous
 
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
speaker said that doctor could be in
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
Aruba on a beach you sign that piece of
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
paper but the PA can't be practic iing
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
medicine unless that unless there is a
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
physician available for consultation the
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
law says they have to consult and that's
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh the law wouldn't even need
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
to say that it happens all the time
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
anyways so we heard a prior speaker I
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the reasons why um and I
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
I I shouldn't attribute any remarks to
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
anyone as I understand it Physicians are
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
paid often are paid get extra
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
compensation for signing a collaboration
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
agreement for a PA like for their
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
employer the employer goes hey can you
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
sign this but they might they might be
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
paid they're they are likely paid
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
several thousand dollars more a year
 
01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
just by putting the signature on that
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
document um that's just you know I would
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that's one could
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
say maybe Money for Nothing um we heard
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
now that's not all practices um I as I
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand it may be convenient MD they
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't pay their docs extra to sign yes
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
ma'am so on the issue of malpractice
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
insurance we heard that come up I think
 
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why PE why doctors
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
are paid more is because now that it
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
does subject them to lawsuit because now
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
their their name is on this
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement what Senate Bill
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
228 did was it made clear that a doctor
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
liable uh for the care that a PA
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
provides uh solely because their name is
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
on that collaboration agreement so that
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
doctor who signed that collaboration
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
agreement who's in AR Ruba of course had
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the care of the
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
patient that is maybe bringing some sort
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
of an action um now that doesn't mean
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
they still can't be included in the
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but now there's some protection
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh of course if that doctor was present
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
there or any doctor any member of the
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare team to your question
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
provided care of any kind or you know I
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
I would think maybe is in the building
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
of course they're going to be wrapped up
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
in that lawsuit that doesn't change and
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
the other thing that doesn't change here
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
if I didn't make this point earlier and
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize is that the scope of
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
practice for PAs will not change I think
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative Roser alluded to that
 
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
nothing changes it's just about does a
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
PA need a piece of paper with a
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
physician signature on it that they may
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
never meet the situation described in
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
and uh with the Pennsylvania physician
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
there that's a compact doctor and as I
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
understand it a physician physician
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
assistants who can own their own
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
practices but they still need to have
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
this piece of paper
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
signed they can there are Physicians who
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
are in compact States who will sign
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
these and they charge not $11,000 it
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
could be up to $11,000 a month that was
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
the number given to us is thousand a
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
month yes and so and and I'm this is
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
what I've been been told uh by uh you
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
know through nispa so that's a real
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
number that's a barriered entry of
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
course Pas are more expensive to hire to
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
employers than npes because they have to
 
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
pay doctors more uh it's a it's a and so
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
I know Massachusetts there's a law that
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
would um give partial as a path to full
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
independent practice uh they they have a
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
with a two after 2,000 hours of practice
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
once you're out of school um and so
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's just to the sth of us and of
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
course we all know that that's really
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
where the drain is for a lot of the
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Professionals is is to
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I apologize for uh
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
going over my time Madam chair and I'm
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions representative
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
broa has a
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you so this collaboration
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
agreement do we have um can we get a
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
copy of that is that a uniform document
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
it is not a uniform document um it the
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
law specifically says here's what it
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
must say and I I if with the chair's
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
indulging I I could read it um but I
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
328d we can find it up we can look it up
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves but there is a there are
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
stipulate it does have a it's some place
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
defined what this piece of paper says
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
correct it yes it must say I I and I
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
don't mean to be Tri Madam chair but I
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
guess it's really a name rank and serial
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
number um and then pract
 
01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
employers or the parties who are signing
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
this document can add as much as they
 
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
want to it but the law says it must say
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
these things and then it's kept on file
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
at the place of employment so it no
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
longer even goes to the Board of
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
Medicine but it must be produced on
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
demand if there were an investigation by
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine as the prior
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
speaker had had laid out could you
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
please quote the RSA so I you said it so
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
quickly I didn't hear it yeah let me
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
just I want I have it here in front of
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
me and I I want to give it the right
 
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh RSA
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
328d colon
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
3-b thank you thank you thank you other
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
questions represent vas yeah uh very
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
very briefly if you if you know uh do
 
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
you have any reason to believe that if
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
we got rid of the requirement for that
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
signed collaboration agreement if the uh
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
PA's medical insurance would uh
 
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
PA's medical insurance would uh
increase

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
I okay just as a person who was you know
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
kind of sort of in this I would expect
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
the answer to be yes um I know in
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
reality once Senate Bill 228 passed um
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
and the compromise there because the
 
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
trial lawyers um wanted a requirement in
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
law that Pas carried appropriate medical
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance Pas are the only
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
provider a healthc care provider in the
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
state where it's required by law that
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
they carry malpractice insurance no
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
other provider is required by that law
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
so that was part of the compromise of
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
moving 228 forward was to have that
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
requirement placed upon Pas and only Pas
 
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
and of course and so Pas uh saw their
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance after 220 uh was
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
was passed it may be a coincidence but
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
uh we have heard that uh malpractice
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
insurance rates for Pas have have
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed since the passage of just
 
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
that bill all right thank
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
you lovely representative
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you tell us um
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
currently are Pas allowed to prescribe
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
opiates and if so how does that process
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
work yes they are and they're subject uh
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
the same as an NP or uh any other
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
provider that can prescribe those medic
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
those medications and they're subject to
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
the same federal and state laws and
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
regulations along those lines and it's
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
under their own
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
signature yes that's correct
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative representative manuti
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair how does this uh
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
signature requirement if that is removed
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
for Pas how does the reimbursement from
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance will that change uh thank
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh pas are uh they
 
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh pas are uh they
are

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursed directly for the care they
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
provide so they don't go through um that
 
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who's on that piece of paper um I
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
I would I would note
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and you you this there was a point I
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
I forgot to mention if there was one
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
change and I haven't really had a chance
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
to look at the amendment if there was
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
one change the Pas would suggest to this
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
bill um if again a bill that was not
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
brought forth at our request is that we
 
01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
think it's responsible that there should
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
be a collaboration agreement uh for a
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
period of time once a PA comes out of
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
school and begins to practice uh or I
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
would say not you know at regardless of
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
their age I mean a lot of times they're
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
younger you know in their early 20s but
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
we think a period of time with a
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement would be
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh I mentioned Massachusetts
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
they have a bill pending that would have
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
2,000 hours that's the equivalent of a
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
year um again no other provider would
 
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
have that requirement but we do we but
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
Pas feel like it would be responsible to
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
have uh maybe a 2,000 hour requirement
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh with a collaboration agreement and
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
then after the 2,000 hours that that
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement would no longer
 
01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.870 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement would no longer
be

01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you representative Cota
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
has a question yes I just read that
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
statute and it does say that um the
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement M um means that
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
the physician is is available for any
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
type of question that the phys physician
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
assistant may have and you didn't
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
mention that in your description so it
 
01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.390 align:start position:0%
mention that in your description so it
does

01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
provide on a consistent basis the
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
availability of that physician which I
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
think is needs to be pointed out is that
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
correct uh you're correct and if and I
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
was if I was attempting to actually make
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
that point if I didn't clearly then I I
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
apologize and that's an that's a very
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
important Point uh representative to
 
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
raise and I apologize for not making it
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
clear or thank you um the point I was
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make was it doesn't it's it
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the doctor that signs
 
01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
that that collaboration agreement who
 
01:30:39.629 --> 01:30:39.639 align:start position:0%
was available either in person or
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
electronically it has to be a member of
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
The healthc Care team on which that pa
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh Works performs practices medicine so
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
there does have to be a physician
 
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
available either in person or
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
electronically uh for consultation
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
whenever a PA is practicing medicine and
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
that is set forth in this in the statute
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
that that you mentioned and if I wasn't
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
a clear again I
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
apologize represent Simon thank you
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh thank you for taking my
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm just trying to parse
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
out the discrepancy between nurse
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners and phys Physicians
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
assistants um you had mentioned in your
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
testimony development over time uh
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
physicians assistant had actually been
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
an assistant to a physician so this kind
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
of collaboration agreement would make
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
sense because the physician was actually
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
responsible to oversee the work of the
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
physician's assistance at at that time I
 
01:31:34.109 --> 01:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
would assume and make sure that they're
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
doing their work appropriately um we're
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
talking about whether we have a need for
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
this collaboration agreement for
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
physician's assistance still or not in
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
its current form uh I guess my question
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to figure out is is
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
there a difference in the scope of
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
practice substant IAL enough that a
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner doesn't need this um
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
and there doesn't seem to be a concern
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
of instituting one even for a year for
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
them but we still need to maintain it
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
for a physician's assistant do we have
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
any kind of um data that would
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh increased safety for
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
patient care that results from these
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
agreements uh these collaborative
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
agreements between a physician assistant
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
and the physician
 
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
um I guess yeah I'm just trying to kind
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
of parse that out could you help me
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh so I I
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
think I believe the short answer to your
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
question is no um The
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
NPS uh there was a time when NPS had to
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
have some the equivalent of a
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
supervisory agreement or collaboration
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
agreement as we say now uh and I believe
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
in 28 States including New Hampshire
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
that is no longer required um so but in
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
terms of the the scope of practice
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're both mid-level providers the
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
scope of practice is ultimately
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
determined by the
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
employer experience training and whatnot
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
but again the short answer is no there
 
01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
is no real I guess there is no
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
difference the Train the training in you
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
know their education and the clinical
 
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
training as part of their education is
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
different Pas is more robust both
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
classroom and clinical but uh if you
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
take two a 20-year PA and a 20 year NP
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know I don't think there's much
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
difference follow did I did you I I feel
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
like there was another part of your
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
question I may not have answered yeah no
 
01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
and I actually think I can clarify after
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
your answer I think I can clarify my
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm really trying to get
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
to the question of patient safety oh
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's right yes so whereas a nurse
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
practitioner doesn't need this agreement
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
and a physician's assistant does need
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
this agreement um do we have any
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
indication that uh there are poorer
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes for people who go to nurse
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
practitioners then go to Physicians
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
assistants because they don't have this
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration oversight agreement in
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
place no I don't believe there's any
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
data that would suggest one way or the
 
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
other okay thank you thank
 
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
Hawks

01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
good I think it's still morning good
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
morning Madame chair members of the
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Ava
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
Hawks and I am here representing the New
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society um and we are
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 1222 at the onset
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
I just want to provide a few clarifiers
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
after um listening to some of the
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and the introduction from the
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and co-sponsor um I will
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
so I want to share a couple things at
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
the onset so I will note my testimony is
 
01:34:51.149 --> 01:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
not catered to or around the amendment I
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
just became aware of the amendment this
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
morning got to glance at it briefly
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
before I passed it off to somebody else
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
so they had a chance to review it um so
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
my amend my testimony is speaking to the
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced secondarily my
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
testimony is not catered to the history
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
of um NPS in our state and their ability
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
to practice because that as my I
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
understand it is not the scope of this
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced or is amended so my
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
testimony does not speak to that history
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make that clear I
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
also want to thank the prime sponsor for
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
being responsive to his constituents and
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
their desire to increase access to care
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
in his area in a previous life be before
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
joining the medical society I worked for
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature and had the opportunity
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
to staff a senator who represented uh
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
Littleton in his district so I I
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
understand the the severe access to care
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
issue in the North Country um so anyways
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
I will get into my testimony and thank
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
you so the relationship between
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians and physician assistance is a
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
valued one as the two work
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
collaboratively as part of a medical
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
team to provide effective patient-
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
centered health care and while Pas are
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
important members of the healthcare
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
ecosystem providing needed supports
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
during a time where the entire Health
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
Care system is struggling with a
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage and significant
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
burnout the extent of the education
 
01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
training and licensing requirements of
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
Pas today would not allow for their
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
independent practice to be conducted
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
safely effectively without Excuse Me
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
Miss Ox you don't really need to read
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
your testimony we've got it here if you
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
just give us the highlights yes you got
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
it Madam chair um I will stop here and
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
just add I know that
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll keep going so just for
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
perspective 46 set of all um states
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
require physician supervision or
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
collaboration of physician assistants in
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
nearly all 50 states physicians
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
assistant scope of practice is
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
determined with a supervising or
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
collaborating physician I am glad my
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
friend uh and uh Dave czy mentioned that
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh we in sential 228 a few years back
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
worked to really redefine New Hampshire
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
statute to speak to how collaborative um
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
the relationship is with Physicians and
 
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
PAs in our State I will also say with
 
01:36:56.109 --> 01:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
all due respect to my friend Dave kzy I
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure our our members and the
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians of the state would not look
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
at the collaborative agreement with Pas
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
is just as simple we signed a piece of
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
paper we're not going to have any
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
contact with this pa uh we would
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree on that but I I I
 
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
understand that he has you know
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
firsthand stories Etc but I wanted to
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
make that clear um I will go back to
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
just reading just to note a statistic to
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
make sure I get it right but the AMA the
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
the largest and only National
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
Association that convenes 190 State and
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
Specialty medical societies strongly
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
opposes legislation such as this and in
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
December they released an article which
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
I've um added the link should folks want
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
to look into that further in this
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that speaks to the risk the
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
concerns about risk to Patient Care um
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
should states begin to allow the inde
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
independent practice of Pas and one
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
quote that I pulled and included that I
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
thought was really important uh resulted
 
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
in um some research conducted with
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
physician assistant program medical
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
directors where 89% of them and 86% of
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
the program directors and
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
100% of past presidents of the PA
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
education accreditation Association the
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
only National Organization representing
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
PA educational programs in the US um
 
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
says that their current curriculum does
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
not prepare graduates to practice
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
without a supervi supervisory or
 
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
collaborative relationship with a
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
physician those are their Folks at the
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
national level and this again was uh an
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
article dropped in December so not that
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
long ago and lastly you know I've
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
expressed for the committee before and
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
other legislation uh that speaks to this
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
issue or similar issues expanding scope
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
for certain folks the society's
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
membership is acutely aware of the
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage and the strains that
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
our healthc Care Professionals are
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
experiencing particularly after the
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and while we again
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the prime sponsor and the
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor effort to address the access
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
to care issues in our state our
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
providers our members are not willing to
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
sacrifice or risk patient safety um by
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
progressing legislation such as this and
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I note in my testimony which I won't
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
read rebate them but the differences
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
between the Education and Training pH
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
between Physicians and physici assistant
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
I know there's been again a lot of
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
comparing of um NPS n pasas again I'm
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
not here to testify to that but what I
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
will say is we could also discuss the
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
the comparisons of PA's educational
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
training hours they need to put in to
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
Physicians and those are those are
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
different so I will wrap it up there and
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take as many questions I
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
know there are other EXP experts here
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
for more technical ones thank you
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
representative leus uh thank you um I
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
know you said you're not here to testify
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
on it you said I'm not sure what you
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
said but it's you know arnps um however
 
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
I mean the comparison that's important
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
to me and I think others on the
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee is uh the difference where
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
aprns I think they're called versus the
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
Pas one has this requirement for the
 
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement the other one
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't and so you know want to
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
understand what is it about either the
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
scope of practice or the training of the
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
two that differs so that it's um okay
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
for one not to have the requirement the
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
other to have it unless the medical
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
society believes APRN should have it too
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
know so I will try and determine the
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
question in that statement
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
um again I I'm happy to follow up with
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
the committee on our position on NP or
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
aprns but I didn't cater my testimony to
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
that conversation because this bill
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
isn't attempting to legislate how NPS or
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
APRN practice in our state you know I
 
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
will focus on the concerns that the
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
medical society our members nationally
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
and locally have about allowing PAs to
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
independently practice and my testimony
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
and additional information submitted by
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
doctors speak to the difference in the
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
Education and Training and I for the
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
sake of time I'm happy to submit
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
followup on what those differences are
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
holistically um and I I know previous
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
testifier had mentioned that there's not
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of founded data to suggest that
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
there are risks to safety I would point
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
to the statistic mentioned at the
 
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of my testimony where 46
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
states don't allow independent practice
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
so there's not going to be data because
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
46 other states have decided that that's
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh would risk patient safety and that's
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answered your
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
question representative and if it didn't
 
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to follow up thank you and I
 
01:41:19.229 --> 01:41:19.239 align:start position:0%
trust you will support the
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes Madam chair
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
okay good this will be going to the
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
licensing subcommittee there are too
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
many issues hanging on this one is any
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
other questions represent Simon thank
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh you mentioned that 46
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
States still require these agreements
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that the medical society has
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh patient safety without
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
them um do you have any data or
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
information or could you get any that
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
would demonstrate
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
increased uh an increase in poor
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
outcomes in the states that have removed
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
this agreement I believe it's was Utah
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
um Wyoming there was a couple of them
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
and whether or not in those States
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
removing those agreements has led to an
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
increase in poor outcomes for patient
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
care I am happy to reach out to some
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
experts and get back to the committee
 
01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.229 align:start position:0%
experts and get back to the committee
thank

01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
you yes representative man pudy thank
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
you madam chair quickly to go back on
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
the four that
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
do not require the collaborative
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
signature do they have the Pas have a
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
separate board in those States or um is
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
it still under the physician that is a
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
great question and I think that question
 
01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
might be better suited to answer it more
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
eloquently by Dave czy if he is still
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
here what that looks like I'm not
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with how those four states
 
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
function but it's an important question
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
that I I feel like should be answered
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
yep thank you other questions thank you
 
01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
very much thanks Madam chair does anyone
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify on House
 
01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.270 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify on House
Bill

01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
1222 seeing none I will close the
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
hearing it is going to
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I will open the hearing
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
Moher

01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to address
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
the committee Madam chair members of the
 
01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
committee I will uh do my best to keep
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony short because after all you
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
can only make so many long
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
speeches this um bill is the result of a
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
long project of cooperation between many
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
members some of which you see in the
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors list but we also reached out to
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
every every stakeholder involved that we
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
could get a hold of we researched what
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
other states have been doing on this
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
issue we've reached out to Veterans
 
01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
organizations we had a lot of
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
conversations with the oplc we spoke
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
with other agencies we reached out to
 
01:44:07.589 --> 01:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
the military really it was a team effort
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
and we had a you know Google Drive and I
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
if I show you how many documents we put
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
together for this um you know you'll
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
understand why sometimes it's hard to
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
stick to a couple of minutes to talk
 
01:44:19.709 --> 01:44:19.719 align:start position:0%
about the result the intent of this bill
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
is to make make it easier for veterans
 
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
who already have met certain
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
requirements that are needed for
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
licensing to get those achievements
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
recognized and get their licensed in a
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
more streamlined and reduced cost
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
process and it's the right thing to do
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
both to recognize their service but also
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the need for any
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
duplicative uh you know training or um
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know unnecessary paperwork if you
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
look at the um
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
Financial note on the bill we were able
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
to craft it so that it should not
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
implementing this should not really
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
require any significant expenses there
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a need for any new staff or
 
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:07.719 align:start position:0%
any new
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations at least you know based
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the current estimates so we've we've
 
01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.510 align:start position:0%
on the current estimates so we've we've
really

01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
done as good of a job as we could to
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
keep this bill narrow in scope and try
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
to get the best bank for the buck as it
 
01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
to get the best bank for the buck as it
were

01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell it requires U some an
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
state employee to be designated as the
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
program administrator and perform a list
 
01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:30.510 align:start position:0%
program administrator and perform a list
of

01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
Duties I would submit that some of them
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
we've had a hard time in the past
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
getting information and I know we had to
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time for example trying
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
to research the various military
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
occupational codes and understand
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
exactly how they map to various licenses
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
it can be a pretty you know um
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
complicated topic so some of those are
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
required now to be maintained by the
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
oplc and kept up to date so you know
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's easier to um um make those
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
equivalences we listed specifically what
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
type of documents would be acceptable
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
how to map experience in the military
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
versus hours of experience in the
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
occupation and so on it's it's
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
reasonably straightforward I believe
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
that um you know this is a good bill and
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm available for any
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have and I'm
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
sorry that you know nobody else from the
 
01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:24.679 align:start position:0%
team was able to make it but this season
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
seems to be very crazy
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
busy I have a uh a question you look on
 
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.229 align:start position:0%
busy I have a uh a question you look on
page

01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
three lines
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
10 you're putting a mandate on insurance
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
carriers to
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
issue um occupational licensing
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
presumably liability
 
01:46:49.589 --> 01:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
licensing regardless of what other
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
people who apply for that
 
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
insurance uh would be required to
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
do how do you think that's possible the
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
intent of that was to make sure that if
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
there are any requirements that are
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
applying to the civilians in order to
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
get licensed and the insurance companies
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
are basing their decision to issue
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
Insurance based on that examination
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
since this may wave some of those tests
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
or examinations we wanted to clarify the
 
01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:23.719 align:start position:0%
language that obtaining the license is
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
what matters in the insurance being
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
issued rather than the insurer checking
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
for you know those specific exams being
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
taken it is just meant as a way to
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
address that potential snag in getting
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
an insurance if the insurance rules have
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
not been
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
updated thank you are there any other
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
broa so I believe that and maybe I'm
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the bill but I believe
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
that we already have reciprocity
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
between the
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
military and New Hampshire so how does
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
this enhance
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
that the intent of this is to streamline
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
the existing um recognition it is
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
basically the reci I don't know if I
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
would use the word reciprocity but the
 
01:48:15.310 --> 01:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
recognition of the military training
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is offering exists
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of other chapters
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
that do this the intent is to make this
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
a bit more extensive and to add
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity and create a few
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
other um requirements for the U veterans
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
to receive prompt you know consideration
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
and again to avoid unnecessary
 
01:48:39.149 --> 01:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
duplicative effort so we do not try to
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
change what already is there we want to
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
add a little bit to it leaving that in
 
01:48:46.589 --> 01:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
place and building on
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
it would it be uh fair to say that what
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
you want is the Department of Veterans
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
Affairs to untangle the military
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
experience codes to help someone who's
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
applying for a license it is one of the
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
goals of the bill that's why on page two
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have specific language on that on
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
page two in uh lines nine and 10 and in
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
the general area this is one part where
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
we heard that people are really having a
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
hard time navigating it and it's not
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
just the veterans sometimes it is the
 
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
people on the oplc that are you know
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
getting confused honestly when you
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
research those military codes you got to
 
01:49:27.149 --> 01:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
remember they also vary by Branch they
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
vary by specialization I understand
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
three of them so yes yes we we are
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
trying to simplify and organize that
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
information thank you represent vus
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah correct me if I'm
 
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
wrong but it looks as though um a large
 
01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
part of this is um is setting up this
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
sort of advisory thing to
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh help as you said both the veterans
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
and oplc understand the equivalence or
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
not um between the two and another the
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance thing is there is there
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
anything in here that requires oplc
 
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
itself to do
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
anything well other than its normal
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
activities I it
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
but I think the best way to answer that
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't call this advisory I would
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
say it's more of an operational
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
requirements on how certain things
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
should be processed it basically
 
01:50:26.669 --> 01:50:26.679 align:start position:0%
requires a particular role to be
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
assigned to somebody and defines the
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for that role it's more
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
than advisory for example if a committee
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
if a board needs an extension they have
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
to ask for one from the V VP
 
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
Administration so it's a bit more than
 
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.790 align:start position:0%
Administration so it's a bit more than
advisory

01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
but yes it is some of this stuff is
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
stuff that the oplc already does some of
 
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
it is not it is an addition and a also a
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
formal a more formal codification of
 
01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
practices that the oplc already has but
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
it's not just that it also adds a little
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
bit to it followup followup so but
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
specifically um you know I may have
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
missed it but is there anything in here
 
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
that directs the oplc to do anything
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
which they're not currently required to
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
do in statute I'm not I think for me I
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
think the answer is no but I I want to
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
verify that that that's correct I I'm
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
not aware of a statute that for example
 
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
would address the requirement
 
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
requirement on the bottom of page two of
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
having a prioritizing an application and
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
issuing a license if warranted in 10
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
days of receipt and of the following
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
portion so it could also be honestly
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
that there are so many statute that it
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
must be somewhere where I don't know
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
about it but I'm not aware of any such
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
requirements so my my belief is that yes
 
01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
we are also asking them to do stuff they
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
are not doing today but we did again
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
have multiple conversations with them
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they are not only comfortable with
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
what is being asked of them but they
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
basically concluded that it will not
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
require additional Appropriations at
 
01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.550 align:start position:0%
require additional Appropriations at
this

01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
time um okay thank you and other than
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
getting help somebody from LC okay we we
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
will hear from more
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
people thank you questions thank
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%

you folks this uh go around uh for those
 
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
of you unfamiliar with what we do um

also on our committee and there are 20
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
veteran service organizations that
 
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
represent our committee and these names
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
would be familiar to you be like the
 
01:53:08.069 --> 01:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
Veterans of Foreign Wars the American
 
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
Legion I personally represent the uh air
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
and space forces Association on the
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee and one of the things that we
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
do is we look through all the bills
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
coming before you folks and we pick out
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
the ones that have veteran impact and
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
then we take a position on those bills
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
and then I come tell you what that
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
position is uh our members unanimously
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
do support this bill and especially
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
support the concept we'll be the first
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
people to readily admit to you that we
 
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't understand all the intricacies of
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
Licensing or oplc or we're hoping that
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
more people understand that than than we
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
do but the idea of streamlining this
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
process and and trying to give a veteran
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
or a veteran's spouse and there's a bill
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the Senate right right now C A bill
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
485 that's helping to speed up spouse
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
licensing uh as well what we're trying
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
to do and and New Hampshire has a great
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
reputation for being a veteran friendly
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
State we're trying to keep that up by
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
trying to remove some of the impediments
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
that somebody might have who's been in
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
the military for a while wants to settle
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
down and bring their family to New
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the idea that they can get an
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
occupational license if it's required
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly because of a program
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
like this we think is a good thing um
 
01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
and the last thing that I just wanted to
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
say is it looks to me like as they've
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
looked at this at least currently as
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's drawn up the the department of
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:35.639 align:start position:0%
can support this inhouse without any
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
additional Personnel uh needs at at
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
least at the current time so we do
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously support this I I think
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
Colonel Perry is is going to tell you
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
some things also from the DMF uh
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
standpoint here in a minute but subject
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
to your questions that's all I wanted to
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
tell tell you this
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
morning thank you I think we'll reserve
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
the questions for the
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
will good morning Douglas sler how
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
office of professional licenser and
 
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
certification General Council uh the
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
office doesn't take a position on this
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
um a lot of my notes today are Technical
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
there is one issue I would like to point
 
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
out um and then I might be able to
 
01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
answer representative lakes's question
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
about the changes to uh I my first
 
01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:32.679 align:start position:0%
concern is on page
 
01:55:37.229 --> 01:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
one um that's section Roman numeral 4
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
lines 22 through 24 that that last line
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
as long as all other board application
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
criteria are meant I think that might be
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
encroaching upon RSA
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
31017 again because we're we're talking
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
about uh Lure by endorsement and
 
01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.790 align:start position:0%
about uh Lure by endorsement and
reciprocal

01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
reciprocal
 
01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:56.669 align:start position:0%
reciprocal
lure

01:55:56.669 --> 01:55:56.679 align:start position:0%
lure
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
um I have a it's not very important but
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page two line 37 it says
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
such application and issue a license if
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
warranted a simple language change shall
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
process the application if we decide to
 
01:56:10.679 --> 01:56:11.629 align:start position:0%
process the application if we decide to
move

01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
forward uh and then on page
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
three which line was that last comment
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
it was line 37 on the on page to it's
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
just a language suggestion nothing
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
nothing of
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
importance and then on page three uh
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
line three middle of the middle of the
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
page there it says if the board must
 
01:56:37.709 --> 01:56:37.719 align:start position:0%
gather further information from any
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
other office or agency in a in order to
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
process the application uh that should
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
probably be the office since we're the
 
01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:49.639 align:start position:0%
ones that's a squishy one because we we
 
01:56:51.149 --> 01:56:51.159 align:start position:0%
the office might be asking for that
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
information and then if it's an a
 
01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
situation where we sent it to the board
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
they might be asking so I think whoever
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
is processing it but it's not
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be the board every
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
time um same thing on line six and then
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
my my concern here is that so under 541
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
a29 the office when we receive an
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
application we have 30 days to review it
 
01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
we notify the applicant of any def icies
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the application and then it says uh
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
not to exceed 60 days from a receipt of
 
01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
initial application the language is a
 
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
little wonky but typically an
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
application is going to be processed 30
 
01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
to 60 days uh what this does is it gives
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
us a 10-day limit my concern here is
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
that in order to extend that 10day limit
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
we would have to request and receive
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
written confirmation from this VAP
 
01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
administrator So within our 10day period
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to submit that day8 they
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
didn't get back to us for three days the
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
oplc is out of compliance at that point
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
um just something I wanted to flag for
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
the committee and then something else to
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
consider the the last section section
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
three this changes the language of
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
332g 7A it would create a new thing if
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
the intent is to have this only apply to
 
01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
the boards under the oplc it might just
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
be an amendment to 31016
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
um I know there's a there's a Senate
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
Bill currently where we've made a
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
similar suggestion and that has to do
 
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
with uh digital verification of lure it
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't overlap here but kind of keep
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
it all in one place
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
31016 because uh
 
01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
332g would apply to LC licenses and
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
professions outside of the
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
oplc for example the New Hampshire Bar
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
Association so um and then I well I
 
01:58:54.189 --> 01:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
guess I guess people after me can speak
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
to some of the collaborative efforts
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
between the oplc and what we're doing
 
01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:59.109 align:start position:0%
between the oplc and what we're doing
for

01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:01.709 --> 01:59:01.719 align:start position:0%
veterans okay thank you and I'm sure you
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative laus yeah
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
just a request and that is um you
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned various concerns and and
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions for the bill if you could
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
send that an email and also the
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
citations the RSA citations that you
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned I didn't get thank
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
you represent Vera hi I just want you to
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
clarify my understanding of the bill so
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
really this licensing this veteran
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
licensing acceleration program is going
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
to be managed and the administrator is
 
01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
going to be managed by the department of
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
military Affairs correct and this and
 
01:59:45.310 --> 01:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
this um these and most of the bill
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
really talks about what that
 
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
administrator and what that organization
 
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
is going to do so do you think that
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
anything within oplc is going to a
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
change as a result of this and um
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
because I don't see how what you're
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
doing now is going to differ this really
 
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
just talks about the program and the
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
administration of that program by the
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
military services is that right I I the
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
big change would
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
be they they would notify us that an
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
application is coming from VAP and then
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
we would have that 10 days to process
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
instead of the typical
 
02:00:26.239 --> 02:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
instead of the typical
541a

02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
541a
 
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
29 deadlines
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
so 10 days instead of 30
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
essentially and and also the need for a
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
response if the application is missing
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
something that I would you agree that's
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
the main part that affects the oplc
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
correct followup followup so is those 10
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
burdensome I suppose
 
02:00:59.310 --> 02:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
that depends I I think I'm more on the
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the back end right like we're
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
striving to get our applications process
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible and we typically can
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
do them very quickly uh under the
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
current situation
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
though you know if we find a deficiency
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
application we notify the individual and
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
then they have time to respond and this
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
would take that away and we would also
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
have to get permission from another
 
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
agency to even extend those deadlines
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I think those are sort of where my
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
concerns are are coming from um I mean
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
theoretically you could one would hope
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of couple of things
 
02:01:36.189 --> 02:01:36.199 align:start position:0%
going on one we're trying
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
to uh with technology make the process
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
better so that applications are complete
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
when they come through the first time
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
which is something we hope to achieve
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
and then I you know if if this position
 
02:01:51.709 --> 02:01:51.719 align:start position:0%
were to work out theoretically we would
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
be getting perfect applications every
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
time I can't guarantee that uh and it's
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
not within the office's
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
control but these are just that kind of
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
timeline it was sort of just something I
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring to your
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
attention thank you represent
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
gold thank you madam chair and and I
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
know this is going to committee so I
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to waste a lot of time on
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
this but I just wondered um if you've
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
had experience with the military and and
 
02:02:22.270 --> 02:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not um dealing with the
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
Veterans office service Affairs have you
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
been has it been difficult to get a
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
response and get a timely response when
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions have come up and oplc needed
 
02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:33.350 align:start position:0%
questions have come up and oplc needed
more

02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
information I think that varies from ly
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
to leny some lenes are incredibly
 
02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
responsive when we send that information
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
away other times the time limits expire
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
and we are forced to deny because they
 
02:02:47.229 --> 02:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
never responded at all so it it varies
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
from Individual okay
 
02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
y other questions thank you very much
 
02:02:53.960 --> 02:03:02.790 align:start position:0%
y other questions thank you very much

Perry good good morning Madam CH Madam
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee for the
 
02:03:07.709 --> 02:03:07.719 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Warren Perry
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy agent general for New
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services in that
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
role we support the National Guard the
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
Division of Community Based military
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
programs the division of veteran
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
services and the Veteran Cemetery the
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
department has doesn't oppose the bill
 
02:03:23.709 --> 02:03:23.719 align:start position:0%
actually supports the bill but I will
 
02:03:26.189 --> 02:03:26.199 align:start position:0%
tell you that in the licensing process
 
02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
the Department's position is the
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
ultimate responsibility to issue the
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
license remains with the boards and oplc
 
02:03:34.589 --> 02:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
so the department of military Affairs
 
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
and veteran services won't necessarily
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
be able to impact whether or not the the
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
board's decision with regard to licenses
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
what we will be able to do is advise
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
them on what training occurred in
 
02:03:49.229 --> 02:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
whatever particular uh military
 
02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
occupational specialty or Air Force code
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
is so that they could make that
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
determination I would also add that the
 
02:03:57.549 --> 02:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility to substantiate any
 
02:03:59.549 --> 02:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
training or experience rest with the
 
02:04:02.189 --> 02:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
veteran not with the department so the
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
veteran will have to substantiate their
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
training we can only assist them with
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
getting records that might substantiate
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
their training helping the board
 
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the board is understand what
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
that training may have consisted of so
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
that they can get it right so again the
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
department will just generally be in an
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
advisory role here with regard to what
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
goes on so I I would also add that you
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
know in in response to some of the the
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions I've had or heard uh in
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
previous testimony which is are we
 
02:04:31.549 --> 02:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
already doing some of these things and
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
the answer is we are um
 
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
110-b col 73 A and B uh that's the
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
Department's regulations I mean statutes
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
they require us to manage a military
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
skills waiver program and a military
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
test waiver program most notably it it
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
deals with Medics and truck drivers like
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
CDL truck drivers because truck drivers
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
is a really transferable skill if you
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
drove a truck in Iraq you could probably
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
drive a truck in New Hampshire right
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
so so those so those things are there
 
02:05:07.069 --> 02:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
but there you know the the military
 
02:05:09.149 --> 02:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
occupational Specialties and
 
02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
understanding them are complicated
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to things
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
like Plumbing or electricians and those
 
02:05:17.069 --> 02:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
kinds of that kind of experience that we
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
have going on so we we can help
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
understand and break down what training
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
or experience you might have gained in
 
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
those Specialties when you're in the
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
military and how they might app apply to
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
the board but again the board is going
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
to make that ultimate decision whether
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
or not to Grant the
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
license thank you um I'm sorry I have a
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
couple more things just before I don't
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
want to take all your time I know it's
 
02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
close to lunch Madam chair I'll get
 
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
through it quickly I'm sorry uh we
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
didn't put a fiscal note on this because
 
02:05:44.109 --> 02:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
we already have the the the
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
administrator who ad manages the uh the
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
military skills test waiver program
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
progr we think we can uh kind of roll
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
these responsibilities they're not that
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
not that significant into that position
 
02:05:58.830 --> 02:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
you know if it if it comes later that it
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
we can't we'll ask for another position
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
as as we move forward and the other
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
thing I I would say is I heard the
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
question about are we are we cooperating
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
with oplc and we are we are really
 
02:06:11.790 --> 02:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
linked with oplc in this regard so I
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
just want to I want to say that one of
 
02:06:15.390 --> 02:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
the things that the executive director
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh Lindsay Courtney is doing is she's
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
led a contract so they can do some
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules review in terms of
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh and I think you may be aware of this
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know how they can rework the
 
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
ministrative rules to to uh to manage uh
 
02:06:33.629 --> 02:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
you know uh issuing licenses and one
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
part of that is
 
02:06:38.189 --> 02:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
incorporating the understanding of
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
military skills and how they may apply
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
and we generally would recommend that
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
they use the American Council on
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
education and how they use that model
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
and how which they Grant college credit
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
for military experience and it's really
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
really mature really really defined and
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
we can kind of tap into that and get it
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
moving uh in the right direction so
 
02:07:02.549 --> 02:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
we're all we already have a plan to have
 
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
input into that contract to make sure
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
that that's addressed and what's going
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
on so you know uh executive director
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%

03:05:17.790 --> 03:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
opening the hearing on House Bill 1131
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
and I call the prime sponsor
 
03:05:19.359 --> 03:05:26.309 align:start position:0%
and I call the prime sponsor
representative

03:05:26.309 --> 03:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Madame chairwoman and
 
03:05:30.190 --> 03:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you all for all of
 
03:05:32.229 --> 03:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
your work it's nice to be in this nice
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
big room so my bill on HB 1131 is just
 
03:05:39.710 --> 03:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
adding something that I think was
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
probably back in the day you know
 
03:05:43.229 --> 03:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
omitted with a reason but doesn't
 
03:05:45.229 --> 03:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense now so we're
 
03:05:49.229 --> 03:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
talking about um in section D so the
 
03:05:50.349 --> 03:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
03:05:52.389 --> 03:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
services and it's talking about people
 
03:05:55.150 --> 03:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
that are really waiting on their um
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
their permanent license so they have a
 
03:05:58.750 --> 03:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
conditional license similar to the last
 
03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill I talked about so we're talking
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
about the conditional license period so
 
03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
they've already gone through all their
 
03:06:04.510 --> 03:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
schooling they've done all their work
 
03:06:07.070 --> 03:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
they've been able to intern um while
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
they're getting their uh approval and
 
03:06:10.990 --> 03:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
getting all of that done and there say
 
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
by the way as an intern uh they're able
 
03:06:15.670 --> 03:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
to see about 20 patients a week
 
03:06:17.469 --> 03:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes and So then whenever they
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
graduate and they're waiting on that
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
permanent license where they're able to
 
03:06:24.790 --> 03:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
work under current statute statute only
 
03:06:26.550 --> 03:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
lets you go to a like a state
 
03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
institution or facility so I'm just
 
03:06:31.070 --> 03:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
adding outpatient Private Practice to
 
03:06:33.389 --> 03:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
that because currently they are able to
 
03:06:37.030 --> 03:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
intern at an outpatient private practice
 
03:06:38.790 --> 03:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
but then once they get their all their
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
schooling done and everything that stops
 
03:06:42.990 --> 03:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
so we have a lack of like Continuum of
 
03:06:44.670 --> 03:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
Care ha so then and it could take up to
 
03:06:47.150 --> 03:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
2 years to get their permanent license
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
so if they're only able to then go to
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
state facilities to be able to work in
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
that period the state facilities can't
 
03:06:55.269 --> 03:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
handle all of the interns so it's kind
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
of that one of these things with our
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services where we're
 
03:07:01.070 --> 03:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
trying to uh open up a bottleneck in
 
03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have enough
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
providers thank you I have a couple of
 
03:07:08.269 --> 03:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
questions that came out of a related
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill 1413 sure I'll do my
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
best and if you could um the first one
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
is that these individuals M do not
 
03:07:21.870 --> 03:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
require any sort of license at
 
03:07:24.750 --> 03:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
all they could be conditionally licensed
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
but they don't need to be on that is
 
03:07:29.790 --> 03:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
that your intent this is this you are
 
03:07:32.469 --> 03:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
amending the exemptions from lure this
 
03:07:32.479 --> 03:07:33.389 align:start position:0%
amending the exemptions from lure this
is

03:07:33.389 --> 03:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
not this is not my intent my intent is
 
03:07:39.389 --> 03:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
that they can still while they do not
 
03:07:40.990 --> 03:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
have their full license but they have
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
their conditional license to be able to
 
03:07:44.910 --> 03:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
continue at the outpatient Private
 
03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
Practice where they've been doing their
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
internship thank you that would help a
 
03:07:51.309 --> 03:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
lot because it came out in the hearing
 
03:07:56.469 --> 03:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:59.550 --> 03:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
um nonprofits were able to use this
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
exemption but for-profits weren't and
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's why we haven't done anything with
 
03:08:06.070 --> 03:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
the other bill because we wanted to get
 
03:08:08.110 --> 03:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
these two and work them together okay so
 
03:08:11.309 --> 03:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
this is not for unlicensed practice
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
right not at all
 
03:08:16.630 --> 03:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's very important
 
03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
other questions representa manuti thank
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair currently when they do
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
the internship at the um government or
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
public uh facility are they is it a paid
 
03:08:37.630 --> 03:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
or unpaid uh internship I would have to
 
03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
defer that to someone that would know
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
more information I do not know about
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
that represent laus thank you so um as I
 
03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:47.630 align:start position:0%
that represent laus thank you so um as I
understand

03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:08:47.640 --> 03:08:49.790 align:start position:0%
understand
it

03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I think you said something about
 
03:08:54.349 --> 03:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
their their still part of their
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
training um they could work at an
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
outpatient Private Practice place and
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
then uh after the Train's complete they
 
03:09:04.510 --> 03:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
can't currently yes okay follow up
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
follow up all right so when they're
 
03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
doing it for their training when they're
 
03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
working in outpatient Private
 
03:09:14.670 --> 03:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
Practice um is there any additional
 
03:09:16.870 --> 03:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
supervision or whatever of what they're
 
03:09:19.630 --> 03:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
doing than there would be um after
 
03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
they've finished their education and
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
they were to do the same thing sure so
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
there is supervision when they're in
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
their internship and thank you for the
 
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
question there is also and this is kind
 
03:09:30.389 --> 03:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
of that last feel I came and talked to
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
you all about that conditional license
 
03:09:34.670 --> 03:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
there is a supervisor so even so when
 
03:09:36.190 --> 03:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
they have their conditional license
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
there is still a supervisor until
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
they're fully licensed so that would be
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
I somebody else will answer that for
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
sure but from what I understand that
 
03:09:48.750 --> 03:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's that supervisor can then continue
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
on with them the requirements for a full
 
03:09:55.990 --> 03:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
license is a certain amount of
 
03:09:59.670 --> 03:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
supervised practice and if I understand
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
correctly this exemption and the supervi
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
is intended to give them a license
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
for for them to charge while they are
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
performing the supervised practice yes
 
03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
yes we're not looking to um limit any
 
03:10:18.389 --> 03:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know or to um take shortcuts or
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
anything on their education or on their
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
work we're just we're looking to open
 
03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
this up so that they can stay so that we
 
03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
can have a Continuum of Care because
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
they've already been seeing like 20
 
03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
patients a week um so that they can
 
03:10:30.269 --> 03:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
continue that in their conditional
 
03:10:33.550 --> 03:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
license period okay thank you
 
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else thank you very much
 
03:10:40.750 --> 03:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:57.550 --> 03:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
this better all right okay I really
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
should reconsider running for State Rep
 
03:11:03.150 --> 03:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
again because I've been here more than
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
my last term uh but again melbourn Moran
 
03:11:07.150 --> 03:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
Jr I'm a licensed independent clinical
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
social worker I'm owner and operator of
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
one or less therapeutic services in
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
ntional New Hampshire and outpatient
 
03:11:14.670 --> 03:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
Private Practice I spoke uh before you
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing on the other uh
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm here in support of this
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill um just like representative Craig
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
said um it is
 
03:11:27.150 --> 03:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
an a good idea in the sense with the
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
interns for example and I can break them
 
03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
down and I can provide additional
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
information uh regarding the actual ins
 
03:11:34.710 --> 03:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
and outs of how we practice uh
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy in a private practice so I
 
03:11:39.150 --> 03:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh my organization has a very good
 
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
relationship with Rivier University we
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
have uh numerous uh interns from from
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
Riv uh that come uh to do their
 
03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
internship in other schools as well some
 
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh unite School social work uh as well
 
03:11:51.630 --> 03:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
we have students from there and other
 
03:11:53.429 --> 03:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
schools of social work so they would
 
03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
come and complete their internship and
 
03:11:56.830 --> 03:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
through the statute as it is now they
 
03:11:58.990 --> 03:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
are exempt from needing a supervision
 
03:12:00.550 --> 03:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
contract because they are a part of an
 
03:12:02.910 --> 03:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
accredited program that allows them to
 
03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
practice uh Psychotherapy under the
 
03:12:07.710 --> 03:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
supervision of a field instructor like
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
myself or another qualified
 
03:12:13.630 --> 03:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
independently licensed practitioner um
 
03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
as you can see many folks want to stay
 
03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
at that internship that they've just
 
03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
built up a a great relationship with the
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
their hopefully potential new employer
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
and I've already have a good solid case
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
load typically around 20 clients or so
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
just like my represent had stated there
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
is uh often a gap there and uh in the
 
03:12:37.110 --> 03:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
sense of that person graduates and full
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
stop we have to wait all their patients
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
have to stop receiving treatment because
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have a supervision contract
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
on file with the board of mental health
 
03:12:49.150 --> 03:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
so otherwise they're already qualified
 
03:12:51.309 --> 03:12:51.319 align:start position:0%
to provide that service they've been uh
 
03:12:54.030 --> 03:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
through an accredited uh degree program
 
03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
they have all the requirements to
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
provide the service they've been doing
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
it already unlicensed under the
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
supervision of a internship supervisor
 
03:13:04.269 --> 03:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
by the way no contract in that sense has
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
to go to the board of mental health for
 
03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
approval um but then they have to stop
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
the treatment of these um Pro uh these
 
03:13:13.710 --> 03:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
folks seeking chronic mental health care
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and as I said in the last testimony
 
03:13:17.469 --> 03:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes that can take in one case four
 
03:13:19.150 --> 03:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
months for one of my staff to uh get
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
that supervision contract approved so
 
03:13:24.510 --> 03:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
for a business like my own I either lose
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
an employee or we have 20 patients that
 
03:13:28.870 --> 03:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
we can't serve uh and not just we're
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
just talking about one intern we have
 
03:13:33.150 --> 03:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
many interns um in that function the
 
03:13:37.030 --> 03:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
other great thing about this bill is uh
 
03:13:39.190 --> 03:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
like I discussed last time the the full
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
intent is to have someone contracted for
 
03:13:43.990 --> 03:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
supervision through approved supervisor
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
with the board of mental health so they
 
03:13:47.590 --> 03:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
can get the hours TOS their license but
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
things happen people leave agencies and
 
03:13:53.309 --> 03:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
for a period of time that person under
 
03:13:54.990 --> 03:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
the supervision contract if their
 
03:13:57.429 --> 03:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
supervisor leaves or something horrible
 
03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
happens to them they can't practice
 
03:14:02.190 --> 03:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
because the it's void we have to get
 
03:14:04.190 --> 03:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
another supervisor we have to get it
 
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
reapproved by the board of mental health
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
and then they can practice again that
 
03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
only applies to out patient private
 
03:14:15.389 --> 03:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
practice at a Community Mental Health
 
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
Center at an institution or another
 
03:14:19.670 --> 03:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit a freder qualified Health
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
Center that doesn't happen because
 
03:14:24.150 --> 03:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're already exempt from this uh via
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation it's just good care to
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
allow uh private practices to be
 
03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
included in this because the RSA clearly
 
03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
states clinical supervision is being
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
provided by that agency and federal law
 
03:14:40.429 --> 03:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
when it comes to billing uh for Medicare
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and other services require
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
pre-licensed professional to be under
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
the supervision of a licensed
 
03:14:49.150 --> 03:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
professional we're not doing anything
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's already out of the norm I'm
 
03:14:52.269 --> 03:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
licensed here in New Hampshire
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Washington State I
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
have an office in Massachusetts I'm
 
03:14:58.429 --> 03:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
opening one in Washington state those
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
two states Washington and New Hampshire
 
03:15:02.790 --> 03:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
no supervision agreement exists you have
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
a supervisor who who's supervising you
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
things change they might have to get
 
03:15:08.910 --> 03:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
another supervisor and at the end of the
 
03:15:10.710 --> 03:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
supervision you sign a form submit it
 
03:15:12.510 --> 03:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
under pains and penalty of perjury and
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
then you take your test and get your
 
03:15:16.750 --> 03:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
license this is a very odd thing the
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
supervision piece in the state of New
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no other state does it like
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
this and it interrupts Quality Health
 
03:15:25.309 --> 03:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
Care uh to patients because we're the
 
03:15:28.510 --> 03:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
only industry that's not exempt from
 
03:15:30.269 --> 03:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
when there's a A disruption in this in
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
the clinical
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
supervision thank you I have a question
 
03:15:37.469 --> 03:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
this statute requires clinical
 
03:15:39.550 --> 03:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
supervision of Staff presumably
 
03:15:42.510 --> 03:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
including the new hires how was that
 
03:15:45.229 --> 03:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
different from the requirement to have a
 
03:15:47.550 --> 03:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
supervision agreement thank you that's
 
03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
an excellent question uh Madam
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
chairwoman the supervision agreement
 
03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
only exists in the context of getting
 
03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
approved hours that will count towards
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
lure right so the hours that will count
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
if that agreement has to change or is
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
not in in Force at the time those hours
 
03:16:07.870 --> 03:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
won't count towards someone seeking
 
03:16:09.870 --> 03:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
their hours they'll still have
 
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
independently licensed supervision
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
they'll still be signing off uh notes
 
03:16:16.150 --> 03:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
have to be signed off by the supervisor
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
every single note has to be routed to
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
the supervisor and approved uh Medicare
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
just did reduce some of their uh
 
03:16:24.030 --> 03:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
stringencies they are now allowing that
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
the the provider doesn't need to be
 
03:16:28.429 --> 03:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
physically on site uh for the patient uh
 
03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be seen um by the pre-licensed person
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
but when that supervision contract is
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
interrupted or not in place those hours
 
03:16:38.229 --> 03:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
aren't counting they're still getting
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
clinical supervision but it's just not
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to count towards their
 
03:16:41.279 --> 03:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
going to count towards their
license

03:16:43.110 --> 03:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:16:44.590 --> 03:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
all right well I can see why this bill
 
03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee anyone else have a
 
03:16:52.790 --> 03:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
question represent man py thank you
 
03:16:55.030 --> 03:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair you mentioned that you have
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
an office in Massachusetts and you have
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
an office in New Hampshire how
 
03:17:01.469 --> 03:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
distinctly different it is for you to
 
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
get interns locally in Massachusetts and
 
03:17:09.630 --> 03:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
provide continuity versus internship in
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you representative
 
03:17:13.309 --> 03:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
that's also another great question uh in
 
03:17:15.030 --> 03:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
our Massachusetts office that's not even
 
03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
a question of concern uh because there's
 
03:17:19.389 --> 03:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
no barrier uh that would exist in the
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts to prevent that
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
person from staying on uh and getting a
 
03:17:24.910 --> 03:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
supervisor and working towards their uh
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
liur of independent um license and uh be
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
mindful of the outpatient practice just
 
03:17:32.510 --> 03:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
like with any even the mental health
 
03:17:35.710 --> 03:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
centers that person who's uh unlicensed
 
03:17:39.309 --> 03:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
still has to meet criteria uh for
 
03:17:41.389 --> 03:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to either to build
 
03:17:42.510 --> 03:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
for their service they have to have an
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
accredited degree they have to have um
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
that supervisor like we just talked
 
03:17:50.830 --> 03:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
about and it is the uh responsibility of
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
the agency to ensure that they meet the
 
03:17:55.870 --> 03:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
criteria absent of these uh AG uh
 
03:17:58.469 --> 03:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
supervision agreements because otherwise
 
03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
you're committing fraud and if there's
 
03:18:03.389 --> 03:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
an agency out there who wants to utilize
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
this for some Mal intent and not have a
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
qualified clinician that they're
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
breaking the law this is a Chang in the
 
03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
law for people who want to do good and
 
03:18:15.070 --> 03:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
follow it and not have to pause
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
treatment for their patients because of
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
a a blip that we got excluded um from
 
03:18:20.239 --> 03:18:21.110 align:start position:0%
a a blip that we got excluded um from
this

03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%

Penacook uh I've asked my client to join

03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
committee members had asked that she is
 
03:19:11.229 --> 03:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
in a position to answer if people would
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
like to uh more information on that uh I
 
03:19:18.429 --> 03:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
rise today in support of house bill
 
03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
11:31 and respectfully ask the committee
 
03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
to consider a housekeeping Amendment
 
03:19:28.110 --> 03:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
related to the topic of the bill
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure you've all had one of those
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
days when I printed out 20 copies of the
 
03:19:34.790 --> 03:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment this morning and left
 
03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
them in my
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
office so I have emailed through the
 
03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
committee um testimony submission link
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
the the proposed amendment for you folks
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
to look at and I'll go through it uh at
 
03:19:47.469 --> 03:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
this point it's very straightforward as
 
03:19:48.830 --> 03:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
I said it's housekeeping I understand
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's the kiss of death but it truly is
 
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
housekeeping so the
 
03:19:56.510 --> 03:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
first uh change goes back to house bill
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
65 655 from last year it is in regards
 
03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
to the investigation section 310
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
col9 specifically the subject matter
 
03:20:11.309 --> 03:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
expert we spent a long time last year
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
working with PLC came up you'll recall
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
that several of my clients had concerns
 
03:20:19.189 --> 03:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
about how subject matter expert was
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
determined in the bill uh we agreed to
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
language at the oplc and in some last
 
03:20:26.510 --> 03:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
minute changes at the committee of
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
conference there was just a mixup it was
 
03:20:33.189 --> 03:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
not a willful um uh attempt to change
 
03:20:35.229 --> 03:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
the language it was a mixup so we're
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
here now asking that that be changed
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
back to what we had originally proposed
 
03:20:43.150 --> 03:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
with oplc support I will be meeting with
 
03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney this week to go through
 
03:20:47.229 --> 03:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
the language again she tells me it's
 
03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
been a year she wants to make sure she
 
03:20:50.349 --> 03:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
knows exactly what the language says so
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
we're go through the language again uh
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
but she is in support of the concept of
 
03:20:58.189 --> 03:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do uh it will the
 
03:20:59.950 --> 03:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
appointment of subject matter experts
 
03:21:02.790 --> 03:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
will remain with the director of the
 
03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
oplc and the boards will set the
 
03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
criteria of of where the oplc will look
 
03:21:12.670 --> 03:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
for um
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
experts the second piece of the
 
03:21:19.630 --> 03:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is in regards to the licensed
 
03:21:23.710 --> 03:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker chapter 330 uh
 
03:21:23.720 --> 03:21:25.269 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker chapter 330 uh
330

03:21:25.269 --> 03:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
330
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
a18 we just became aware recently that
 
03:21:30.830 --> 03:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
the licensed clinical social worker is
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
the official statutory name for the
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
licensed independent clinical social
 
03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
worker unfortunately all Professionals
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the state as well as the board and
 
03:21:44.710 --> 03:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
many others refer to social workers as
 
03:21:46.590 --> 03:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
licensed independent clinical social
 
03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:48.150 align:start position:0%
licensed independent clinical social
workers

03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:21:50.790 --> 03:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
LCSW all this amendment is asking to do
 
03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
is to put the statutory title and the um
 
03:21:58.990 --> 03:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh normal usage title together and just
 
03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
refer to as the licensed independent
 
03:22:03.229 --> 03:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker and that relates
 
03:22:06.030 --> 03:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
to the provisional um license as
 
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
well that is the extent of what this
 
03:22:10.510 --> 03:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Amendment asks for you
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
folks to consider
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
and with that I will end my
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
testimony and if the chair would like um
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
some of the questions um Miss gar
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
Stanley could certainly
 
03:22:26.110 --> 03:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
answer representative laus you have a
 
03:22:27.630 --> 03:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm just maybe a little
 
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
confused so and maybe you can help um it
 
03:22:29.880 --> 03:22:30.750 align:start position:0%
confused so and maybe you can help um it
sounds

03:22:30.750 --> 03:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
03:22:36.269 --> 03:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
like they're proposing um an amendment
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
on kind of related but different topics
 
03:22:41.189 --> 03:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
to this bill that are not part of the
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill it we need to look at that
 
03:22:44.950 --> 03:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and see if it is actually
 
03:22:48.429 --> 03:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
Germain it may or may not be but yes we
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
we need to examine it um and it will be
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee because the the
 
03:22:58.389 --> 03:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
content of House Bill 1413 overlaps with
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
this so we need to make sure we're not
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
making changes of one that are
 
03:23:04.189 --> 03:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
contradicted and we can look at whether
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
that amendment is appropriate to one
 
03:23:07.710 --> 03:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
bill or the other maybe whatever okay
 
03:23:09.150 --> 03:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
03:23:12.670 --> 03:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
indeed represent Manti thank you Madame
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
chair so this the Gap what currently
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
exists that the internships internist
 
03:23:26.189 --> 03:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
can go to nonprofit and
 
03:23:29.990 --> 03:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh governmental agency versus private
 
03:23:32.910 --> 03:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
practice that Gap will be closed with
 
03:23:32.920 --> 03:23:34.150 align:start position:0%
practice that Gap will be closed with
your

03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:23:36.630 --> 03:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh amendment that you're
 
03:23:40.429 --> 03:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
proposing by changing the
 
03:23:42.990 --> 03:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
title no thank you representative for
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
the question it it it has no bearing on
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
the original bill it's just since lure
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
for social workers started we've all
 
03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
been lcsws those are the letters after
 
03:23:57.950 --> 03:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
our name licensed independent clinical
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
social worker uh last year because in
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
statute it says licensed clinical social
 
03:24:08.349 --> 03:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
worker we suddenly went to
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
LCSW as our
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
letters which created a lot of
 
03:24:19.790 --> 03:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
confusion and uh and is this a new
 
03:24:22.910 --> 03:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
license is does this have a different
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
scope the amendment basically is just
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
asking for our letters back so that we
 
03:24:30.429 --> 03:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
can not have to update all of our
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
websites and business cards and all of
 
03:24:35.910 --> 03:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
that uh because we've always been
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
licensed independent clinical social
 
03:24:39.910 --> 03:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
workers it has no bearing on the
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
original and that's why it's probably
 
03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a non- germine Amendment but
 
03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:46.910 align:start position:0%
going to be a non- germine Amendment but
no

03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
problem other
 
03:24:51.070 --> 03:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you very much
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:25:08.189 --> 03:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:10.870 --> 03:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
kleene all right thank you my name is
 
03:25:13.630 --> 03:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
James D senior uh I just graduated from
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
for University with masters in social
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
work so this affects me right from the
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
GetGo um I work for one toess therapic
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
services from Melbourne Moran and um I
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
had this issue as soon as I graduated so
 
03:25:28.670 --> 03:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts there wasn't this
 
03:25:30.990 --> 03:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
restriction so from the day I graduated
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
May 20th last year I could start working
 
03:25:37.189 --> 03:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
all my hours counted towards my
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
licsw uh as a matter of fact the day I
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
graduated I could actually apply
 
03:25:44.429 --> 03:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
and take the LCSW exam down in
 
03:25:46.150 --> 03:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which is licensed
 
03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
certified social worker you can't do
 
03:25:50.510 --> 03:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire it wasn't until
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
almost the end of August that I got
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
approved for supervisory hours through
 
03:25:56.910 --> 03:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh the state of New Hampshire so that's
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
almost a four Monon Gap that I have to
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
wait to get my licsw here in the state
 
03:26:03.950 --> 03:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so because of that
 
03:26:06.189 --> 03:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
what's happening is a lot of individuals
 
03:26:07.429 --> 03:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
Which social workers are there to
 
03:26:10.030 --> 03:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for there's a lot of wait list
 
03:26:11.670 --> 03:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's not enough clinicians there's
 
03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
not enough um funds when you work at a
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mental Health Community Center so
 
03:26:19.870 --> 03:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
those weight lists can be six to 12
 
03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
months long and those individuals are
 
03:26:23.469 --> 03:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
not getting the care they need uh what's
 
03:26:26.110 --> 03:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
also happening is is a lot of the my
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
cohorts my co-workers they are leaving
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
the state because of some of these
 
03:26:32.670 --> 03:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
things especially the new grads because
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's much easier to go to a different
 
03:26:37.389 --> 03:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
state and get licens quicker and start
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
working immediately and start serving
 
03:26:40.150 --> 03:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
the people that we are supposed to be
 
03:26:42.510 --> 03:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
serving out there in in the long run
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to save a lot of money for
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
the state especially people that are on
 
03:26:49.469 --> 03:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
state funded Medicaid or Medicare
 
03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
because they're going to get Services a
 
03:26:52.830 --> 03:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
lot better and it's just like a cut if
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
you treat a cut quickly you're probably
 
03:26:58.110 --> 03:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
not going to incur any other issues but
 
03:26:59.710 --> 03:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
like mental health the sooner it gets
 
03:27:01.469 --> 03:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
addressed the easier it's going to be so
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the long run it's going to end up
 
03:27:04.229 --> 03:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
saving money because if it doesn't get
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
addressed individuals can stop taking
 
03:27:07.950 --> 03:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
care of themselves other issues will
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
come up and that's who we really are
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
there to try to serve are all those
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
individuals that need that assistance
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to mental health um and I
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
know talking with other people you know
 
03:27:20.429 --> 03:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
there's reasons why I went out of state
 
03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
for my education um and a lot of my
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
other co-workers again they're talking
 
03:27:27.429 --> 03:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
about and I know other people that have
 
03:27:30.189 --> 03:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
gone out of state uh like Massachusetts
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
I could have gotten licensed to New York
 
03:27:33.670 --> 03:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
the day I graduated but you can't do
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
that here in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
so again there is that Gap uh in mental
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
health it doesn't look at economic
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
status it doesn't look look at gender it
 
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't look at political parties and
 
03:27:45.990 --> 03:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
all I can see from supporting this bill
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
is it's nothing but good can come from
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
this excuse me do I understand you
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
correctly to that you implied that there
 
03:27:56.389 --> 03:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
is no supervised practice required in
 
03:27:58.750 --> 03:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
New York you no you still have
 
03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
supervised practice but the day you
 
03:28:03.910 --> 03:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
graduate you can start uh you can start
 
03:28:05.550 --> 03:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
your hours in other words you don't have
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
to wait an additional time so like right
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
now I'm delayed four months here in New
 
03:28:12.150 --> 03:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus in massach
 
03:28:14.710 --> 03:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
I can be licensed as An Li quicker than
 
03:28:16.229 --> 03:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
I can here in New Hampshire waiting for
 
03:28:18.309 --> 03:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
that and I'll be honest the response
 
03:28:20.189 --> 03:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
back from the board approving these
 
03:28:22.110 --> 03:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
supervisions it's all over the place it
 
03:28:23.229 --> 03:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
could take a couple weeks for some
 
03:28:24.990 --> 03:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
people and it can take up to four months
 
03:28:27.269 --> 03:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
for other people well I'm sorry you had
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
to suffer the longer period are there
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any so thank you
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
for your testimony all right thank
 
03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:48.030 --> 03:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
11:31 all right this will be going to
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh there is some research
 
03:28:54.309 --> 03:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
from our committee researcher on the
 
03:28:54.319 --> 03:28:55.710 align:start position:0%
from our committee researcher on the
conditional

03:28:55.710 --> 03:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
conditional
 
03:28:59.110 --> 03:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
licensure and I'd like to put in the in
 
03:29:03.429 --> 03:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
the record that there are approximately
 
03:29:07.830 --> 03:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
750 unlicensed individuals working under
 
03:29:11.790 --> 03:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
supervision at the moment um the intent
 
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
was to have conditional licenses for
 
03:29:19.030 --> 03:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
these people but that is not yet
 
03:29:19.040 --> 03:29:21.229 align:start position:0%
these people but that is not yet
happened

03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
so all right I will close the public
 
03:29:25.680 --> 03:29:27.750 align:start position:0%
so all right I will close the public
hearing

03:29:27.750 --> 03:29:27.760 align:start position:0%

03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:35:46.110 --> 03:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
145 am I wrong I'm wrong excuse me wait
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.520 --> 03:50:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:14.550 --> 03:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee envir um Edna committee for
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
the time to speak today on this uh this
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
important bill hb1
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
1526 uh I'm introducing this bill
 
03:50:25.389 --> 03:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
relative to a conditional Veterinary
 
03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%

other
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
countries hb1 1526 would authorize the
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
board of veterinary medicine to issue a
 
03:50:36.510 --> 03:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
conditional license to a foreign
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%

supervision by a New Hampshire licensed
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
veterinarian the veterinarian Workforce
 
03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
shortage experienced across the country
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
is often highlighted in New Hampshire um
 
03:51:27.149 --> 03:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
the news of has reported that an
 
03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
estimated 620 licensed veterinarians in
 
03:51:31.550 --> 03:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
the state are seeing increased demand
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
for services burn out after the pandemic
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
and turnover at a rate rate twice that
 
03:51:39.790 --> 03:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
of medical Physicians veter Ians try
 
03:51:42.149 --> 03:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
their best to accommodate owner needs
 
03:51:44.349 --> 03:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
but appointments are booking months in
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
advance for wellness checkups and they
 
03:51:50.189 --> 03:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
can barely keep up with emergency calls
 
03:51:52.750 --> 03:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
as far as licensure fees go if a new
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
license type is developed I would
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
imagine that it would adhere to the
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
current $155 licensing fee specified in
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
administrative rule PLC
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
10002 and any additional licenses would
 
03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
increase Revenue to the oplc fund in the
 
03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
f note the oplc did state that the
 
03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
administrative cost for this could be
 
03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
absorbed into their
 
03:52:18.149 --> 03:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
budget this bill most importantly will
 
03:52:20.110 --> 03:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
help alleviate the veterinarian Staffing
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
shortage problem with the goal of
 
03:52:24.590 --> 03:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
enhancing timely access to Professional
 
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medicine and as chairman of
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee I
 
03:52:31.349 --> 03:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
know that proper care and Humane
 
03:52:34.630 --> 03:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
treatment of dogs and cats and all of
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
our animals require regular veterinary
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
care we currently have a crisis going on
 
03:52:44.309 --> 03:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
with that access to that care and I
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
would ask you now to call Dr CLA Lindo
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
to give her testimony next as she was
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%

03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
this bill she can give you more details
 
03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
on the problems she is currently
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
encountering at her veterinarian clinic
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
and how this bill will help her and
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
other veterinarian clinics in New
 
03:53:05.149 --> 03:53:05.159 align:start position:0%

03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
shortages so thank you and I appreciate
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.149 --> 03:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
listening thank you representative Aaron
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
I take it that means you won't be taking
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions well I can take a question I'd
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions I'm not sure
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
I can answer them sufficiently um so I
 
03:53:27.309 --> 03:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
would defer to uh the veterinarian who
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
is living in the trenches and dealing
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
with this issue okay Dr Lindo and
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh could your associate from The

Claremont Charleston Animal Hospital

join you I think it would save us some
 
03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh some time
 
03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
and thank
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
you um sorry I'm not a really good
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
public speaker so I apologize if I I
 
03:54:03.149 --> 03:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
mumble um so my name is Dr Claire Marie
 
03:54:05.429 --> 03:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
Lindo I am uh a veterinarian in
 
03:54:07.710 --> 03:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
Charlestown New Hampshire I am a Cornell
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
grad from 1998 and have been a
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian since then in uh
 
03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
Charlestown um during the time I've
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
watched um for a decade and a half the
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
number of veterinarians in my area have
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
remained fairly stable and in the past
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
half a dozen years we've lost about half
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians in our area um at that
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
same time we've had more people move
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
into our area uh during covid as they
 
03:54:34.030 --> 03:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
fled the cities and brought their pets
 
03:54:36.189 --> 03:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
with them and more of our clientele
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
because they were home during the
 
03:54:40.149 --> 03:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic all also uh increased the
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
number of pets that they adopted so our
 
03:54:46.510 --> 03:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
case load has has probably doubled and
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
yet our Veterinary colleagues the number
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
of us has diminished by half and it's
 
03:54:54.269 --> 03:54:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's an overwhelming burden and um as
 
03:54:55.830 --> 03:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron mentioned that
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
there is getting to be a lot of burnout
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
in the veterinary field and we really
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
need some help um the reason that I had
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to um that I had asked
 
03:55:07.110 --> 03:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron to introduce this
 
03:55:10.309 --> 03:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill is because I can't affect how many
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
people are going to graduate from
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Schools um there uh
 
03:55:16.630 --> 03:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough there are now 11
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
proposed new Veterinary Schools
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
um and so because creating a new
 
03:55:25.030 --> 03:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
veterinary school is is not a small
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
undertaking um I can't stress enough
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
that obviously the shortage of
 
03:55:30.349 --> 03:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
veterinarians is not projected to change
 
03:55:33.269 --> 03:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
anytime soon if 11 organizations who
 
03:55:35.229 --> 03:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
know about each other's plans are still
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
planning on moving ahead to make new
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
veterinaries colleges in the US it is a
 
03:55:42.349 --> 03:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
a huge burden um additionally new
 
03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
graduating veterinarians are very
 
03:55:45.389 --> 03:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about work life balance which
 
03:55:46.950 --> 03:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful thing but it means that
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
they're not putting in the same number
 
03:55:51.389 --> 03:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
of hours as uh the older veterinarians
 
03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
like myself so we need even more
 
03:55:56.349 --> 03:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to fill that need um but I
 
03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
can't have an impact on the number of
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
people who are going to graduate um but
 
03:56:01.950 --> 03:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
what we could have an impact on is the
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
number of veterinarians who have already
 
03:56:06.429 --> 03:56:06.439 align:start position:0%
graduated who are not licensed to
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
practice um there is a very good good
 
03:56:12.030 --> 03:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
process for uh foreign trained
 
03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarians uh who have graduated from
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
non-av accredited vet schools um to
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
become avma accredited and to be able to
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
apply for a license and that is a
 
03:56:23.149 --> 03:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
fantastic program and I am not looking
 
03:56:25.630 --> 03:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
to circumvent that in any way shape or
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
form I want those veterinarians that are
 
03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
practicing next to me to be equally uh
 
03:56:34.469 --> 03:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
capable uh and meet our us standards the
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
problem is that they're of the two
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
processes one of them that I would focus
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
on is that ECF program the last step in
 
03:56:46.990 --> 03:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
that program is the clinical proficiency
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
examination is Frau with some
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
difficulties the the avma group that
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
oversees it is is underst staffed there
 
03:56:56.469 --> 03:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
are only two places in the United States
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
that actually administer this program
 
03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
the other steps in the ecfv process can
 
03:57:03.309 --> 03:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
be completed by Foreign trained
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in the country that they
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
live in online or by mail but that last
 
03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
process has to be done here in the
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
United States there are no uh uh foreign
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
sites to do that um those two sites in
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
the US can accommodate a little over 200
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
applicants per
 
03:57:23.189 --> 03:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
year there are a number of interesting
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
statistics but one of the thing that's
 
03:57:27.870 --> 03:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
the hardest is that of firsttime
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
candidates through that ECF process
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's a 75% failure rate which means
 
03:57:36.149 --> 03:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
that it adds roughly 50 to 55
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to our Nationwide need one
 
03:57:42.030 --> 03:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
veterinarian per state every year which
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
is not enough
 
03:57:49.030 --> 03:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill as a side effect would help
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
us to train those foreign trained
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
Veterinary graduates so that they might
 
03:57:55.030 --> 03:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
have a better pass rate of that which
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
would help alleviate a little of the
 
03:58:00.389 --> 03:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
backup um but it would also uh by
 
03:58:02.910 --> 03:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
allowing specifically the veterinarians
 
03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
who have passed all of the steps
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
including the national Veterinary
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
licensing exam which is the third step
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the ECF process the same National
 
03:58:13.469 --> 03:58:13.479 align:start position:0%
licensing exam that I had to take and
 
03:58:14.910 --> 03:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
every other veterinarian in the country
 
03:58:18.189 --> 03:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
had to take um after they've passed that
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
and the national uh licensing exam and
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
are waiting on the CPE um this bill
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
would allow them to practice with a
 
03:58:29.710 --> 03:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
conditional license under the
 
03:58:31.469 --> 03:58:31.479 align:start position:0%
supervision of a state licensed
 
03:58:34.510 --> 03:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who can mentor them the
 
03:58:36.510 --> 03:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
same way that I mentored a new graduate
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
from a US accredited veterinary school
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
to help her learn her surgical skills to
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
learn her Small Animal Medical skills it
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
would allow us to Mentor those foreign
 
03:58:48.550 --> 03:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
trained graduates in that same way so
 
03:58:50.710 --> 03:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
that when they take the CPE they could
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
pass that more quickly but in allowing
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
them to be mentored it would also allow
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
them to do some of the things that they
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
are capable of doing uh to help
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the case load for me
 
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
which would mean that my clients and my
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
patients would have more timely
 
03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
veterinary care because right now
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
they we're like like representative
 
03:59:12.750 --> 03:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
Aaron said we're booking out months in
 
03:59:15.870 --> 03:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
advance for routine care there are a lot
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
of people who we have a hard time
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
accommodating with urgencies and
 
03:59:21.750 --> 03:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
emergencies more overflow goes to the
 
03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
emergency hospitals the emergency
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
hospital near me is down to one
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian per shift and they are
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
turning emergencies away we have had
 
03:59:31.469 --> 03:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
them refer people back to us to see
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
emergencies there's not enough of us um
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
so if we could have people who could
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
even do some of the things that a fully
 
03:59:41.710 --> 03:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
licensed veterinarian can do that would
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
be helpful like I said I'm not
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
interested in someone who is not
 
03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
qualified doing this job I care about my
 
03:59:49.950 --> 03:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
patients and my clients so I would not
 
03:59:52.750 --> 03:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire licensed veterinarian
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
not be willing to let people do things
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I don't think they're qualified to
 
03:59:57.030 --> 03:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
do because I don't want them to hurt my
 
03:59:59.710 --> 03:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
patients and my clients so there's no
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
incentive to have people doing things
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't be doing this is an
 
04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
incentive to train people appropriately
 
04:00:09.070 --> 04:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
and help them uh along the way um
 
04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the process now is
 
04:00:13.950 --> 04:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
extremely slow it is over a year wait
 
04:00:17.149 --> 04:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
time to get to the CPE that 75% failure
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
rate is not helpful um if they fail they
 
04:00:21.429 --> 04:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
have to restart the process all over
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
another year or more to wait to get
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
through to retake the sections that they
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
can't take so this bill would help us
 
04:00:29.469 --> 04:00:29.479 align:start position:0%
like I said to have people working
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
temporarily as well as to help train
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
them but the pro provisions of the bill
 
04:00:36.510 --> 04:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
would make sure that this doesn't have
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
people say oh I'll just come VI a
 
04:00:40.510 --> 04:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
temporary or provisional or
 
04:00:42.149 --> 04:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
conditionally licensed veterinarian and
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'll never bother taking the CPE the
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill requires that they be have applied
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
to take the CPE and be somewhere in that
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
process to eventually get their ecfg
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
certificate in order to continue doing
 
04:00:54.720 --> 04:00:56.830 align:start position:0%
certificate in order to continue doing
this

04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think probably at this
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
point if anyone has any questions maybe
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
I can answer questions at this point
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I have one question do us
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
trained veterinarians have to take an
 
04:01:07.960 --> 04:01:09.429 align:start position:0%
trained veterinarians have to take an
equ

04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
equ
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
exam so uh us trained so American
 
04:01:15.149 --> 04:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Veterinary Medical
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
Association accredited veterinarians
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
still have to take the national the nor
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
sorry the North American Veterinary
 
04:01:23.550 --> 04:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
licensing exam before you're allowed to
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
practice that same nav is what is the
 
04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
third step in the ecfg process it is
 
04:01:32.710 --> 04:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
exactly the same test so that they both
 
04:01:36.070 --> 04:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
have to take a test yes but a someone
 
04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
who was not educated in this country
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
needs to take a practical exam yes so in
 
04:01:44.910 --> 04:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
the US um going through your fourth year
 
04:01:49.750 --> 04:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
of clinical rotations you have uh the um
 
04:01:52.229 --> 04:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
Veterinary professors who are monitoring
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
your proficiency during those clinical
 
04:01:58.229 --> 04:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
rotations um the other process the pave
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
process involves those foreign trained
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians going through a year of
 
04:02:04.750 --> 04:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
clinical rotations with those fourthe
 
04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
Veterinary students as the alternative
 
04:02:09.790 --> 04:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
to taking the clinical proficiency exam
 
04:02:12.429 --> 04:02:12.439 align:start position:0%
so the clinical proficiency exam is uh a
 
04:02:14.830 --> 04:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
means of having an equivalent to or an
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
alternative to that fourth year of
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
clinical rotations where you have an
 
04:02:22.269 --> 04:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
observed uh period of of your
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
skills thank you represent leus thank
 
04:02:28.590 --> 04:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
you so you um believe you said that
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
there was a year wait for the CPE is
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
that before you can start it or is that
 
04:02:37.229 --> 04:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
you said that a CPE that process took a
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
year or is it a year
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
so when you apply for the CPE there is
 
04:02:44.670 --> 04:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
over a year weight time to get a seat
 
04:02:47.790 --> 04:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
just to get a slot just to get a slot um
 
04:02:51.070 --> 04:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
that to be able to sit for the exam uh
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of they will notify
 
04:02:56.670 --> 04:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
you their wait time is supposed to be a
 
04:02:58.149 --> 04:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
month or so it seems like it's a little
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
bit longer than that but about a year
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
before you can actually get to take the
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
exam um you are required to take one of
 
04:03:07.510 --> 04:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
the first spots that's open to you um if
 
04:03:09.389 --> 04:03:09.399 align:start position:0%
you can't sorry you go back to the end
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the line and you forfeit your over
 
04:03:12.990 --> 04:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
$7,000 fee that you applied it is
 
04:03:15.269 --> 04:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
non-transferable non-refundable if you
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
can't take those dates uh if you have a
 
04:03:19.870 --> 04:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
medical emergency sorry too bad you go
 
04:03:21.630 --> 04:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
back to the end of the line followup
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
follow up just trying to be clear you
 
04:03:26.030 --> 04:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
said you sit for an exam but also that
 
04:03:27.910 --> 04:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
Practical is the Practical the CP the
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
Practical or is that something it is the
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
exam the clinical proficiency exam so
 
04:03:37.750 --> 04:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's a one year long exam no no it's I'm
 
04:03:37.760 --> 04:03:39.550 align:start position:0%
it's a one year long exam no no it's I'm
sorry

04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:03:42.309 --> 04:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
the exam itself is a I believe three-day
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
seven part exam um that is uh
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
administered in two sites in the United
 
04:03:50.309 --> 04:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
States but it from the time that you
 
04:03:52.349 --> 04:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
apply for that until you can actually
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
take the exam is over a year weight
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
followup follow up yeah I'm trying to
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
understand the process so where in this
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
does fits the one-year clinical that
 
04:04:07.269 --> 04:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
was the the alternative to the ecfvg
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
process for foreign trained
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to become eligible for
 
04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
lure in any state in the US you can
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
either do the ECF process or you can do
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
the pave process the pave process has
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
that one year of clinical rotations the
 
04:04:29.070 --> 04:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
ecfg process has the CPE followup
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully so how long does the
 
04:04:34.389 --> 04:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
ecfg pro what is that process and how
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
long does it take so the first process
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
there are four step steps the first
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
process is um registering it is and I
 
04:04:44.830 --> 04:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
apologize let me just grab my notes to
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that I don't make any mistakes
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
registering proof of graduation uh from
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
a Veterinary College and verifying their
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
Veterinary college credentials the
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
second step is assessing their English
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
language uh abilities the third step is
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
assessing their basic and clinical
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
veterinary science knowledge which is
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
passing that nav exam the same as
 
04:05:06.790 --> 04:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
American veterinarians and then the
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
fourth is the Hands-On clinical
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
Veterinary skills which is that CPE so
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
those first steps um depend on how
 
04:05:17.309 --> 04:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
quickly they are able to have the
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
initial information usually it has to be
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
notorized all of that is checked by the
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
ECF process their committee um but I
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
believe that it is a several year
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
process to get everything told from from
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
start to finish um the ECF process is a
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
several year process at this point
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
followup followup so that's just the E
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
ECF FG VG process and then the cpes
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
after that is am I understanding
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
correctly I think within that couple
 
04:05:46.750 --> 04:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
year process is the CP the whole thing
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the whole thing all right thank
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
you represent Manti thank you Madame
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
chair so with the alternative outside of
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
the country they can do step one two and
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
three process correct if they follow up
 
04:06:02.800 --> 04:06:03.630 align:start position:0%
three process correct if they follow up
with

04:06:03.630 --> 04:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
that uh the
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
clinical practicum and the cpg
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
exam can has to be in person here in
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
country in the country in the US okay
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
one more follow follow up thank you so
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
this applies for both small animals and
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
does sorry so you said that a a foreign
 
04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian could also take the final
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
year of clinical
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
rotations that would I presume involve
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
paying tuition to a vinary school if
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
they could get accepted correct if they
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
can get accepted there are not many
 
04:06:45.309 --> 04:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
seats when I was going through clinical
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
rotations we had four or five foreign
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
trained veterinarians who were part of
 
04:06:53.389 --> 04:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
our class of 80 added to our class of of
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
80 yes um do you know if foreign
 
04:06:56.560 --> 04:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
80 yes um do you know if foreign
veterinarian

04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
schools have clinical rotations
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
included I don't know and I think that's
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that they may or may
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
not be avma accredited did the avma
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
accreditation means that they meet the
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
standards of our us accredited
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
veterinary schools and if they don't
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
have that then they don't meet
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
those right thank
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any other questions
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um I do have a copy of what I
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
had originally prepared because I wasn't
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
sure how much or little information you
 
04:07:38.349 --> 04:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
wanted and so it's being passed out now
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time thank thank
 
04:07:53.550 --> 04:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.670 --> 04:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
aack good afternoon Douglas ster general
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
counsel oplc uh the office doesn't take
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill but I just
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out a few um things that
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
sort of popped out concerns we had uh L
 
04:08:09.149 --> 04:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
three the board May issue the
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
conditional license that's I think
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
everybody could come up here and testify
 
04:08:16.030 --> 04:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
on my behalf at this point um there's a
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
line in here that says uh it's on line
 
04:08:20.149 --> 04:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
five on the condition that the
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian has legal immigration
 
04:08:25.309 --> 04:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
status in the US and verifiable Status
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
information we don't collect immigration
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
status on any application in the office
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
we collect Social Security numbers or
 
04:08:35.149 --> 04:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
tax identification numbers because we
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
have statutory Authority tied to child
 
04:08:40.590 --> 04:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
support issues um if we didn't have that
 
04:08:42.429 --> 04:08:42.439 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority we wouldn't even ask
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
those questions I just wanted to flag
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
that we do not ask that status um
 
04:08:52.030 --> 04:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
there's a word on line eight it says or
 
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
has passed the
 
04:08:57.429 --> 04:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
CP and has applied to it says write the
 
04:09:00.030 --> 04:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire examination I want to make
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
sure that means
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
take the
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
examination um and then the last well
 
04:09:12.109 --> 04:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
line 10 into 11 a conditional license
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
may be summarily revoked by a majority
 
04:09:17.710 --> 04:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
vote of the board there might be some
 
04:09:21.550 --> 04:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
due process issues there 541 if we're
 
04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
going to take um somebody's license away
 
04:09:26.910 --> 04:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
we have to give them notice opportunity
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
to be heard they have to have violated
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
either a statute or a rule but there has
 
04:09:33.309 --> 04:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
to come from some Authority so I just
 
04:09:36.910 --> 04:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag that for the committee um
 
04:09:38.990 --> 04:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to field any
 
04:09:42.990 --> 04:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
questions is Simon thank you madam chair
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to remind myself
 
04:09:46.590 --> 04:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
conditional licensing as we've put it in
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
statute is that always two years or is
 
04:09:49.840 --> 04:09:52.070 align:start position:0%
statute is that always two years or is
that

04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
negotiable that's a good question so my
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
understanding what I'm familiar with
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
with u conditional licing
 
04:10:00.720 --> 04:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
with u conditional licing
is

04:10:03.030 --> 04:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
usually I can look further into this but
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
my experience with it is it's a way to
 
04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
get somebody into the workforce quicker
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
than they would otherwise so the example
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is maybe a nurse who
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
can start working under supervis maybe
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
under supervision who can start working
 
04:10:19.710 --> 04:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
before we have the results of the
 
04:10:21.790 --> 04:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
criminal background checkin which could
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
take 90 days so instead of making them
 
04:10:26.149 --> 04:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
wait the 90 days they work pending the
 
04:10:28.510 --> 04:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
outcome of those results they either be
 
04:10:31.870 --> 04:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
get fully licensed or don't have a
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
license anymore I suppose after notice
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
and opportunity to be heard and mental
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
health the conditional license is two
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
years because it covers the two-year
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
supervised uh experience
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
requirement follow well maybe more to
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
you than to Mr aerop but um the just
 
04:10:56.349 --> 04:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
because this process is so long and
 
04:10:58.630 --> 04:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
involved um was the main reason I was
 
04:11:00.429 --> 04:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
asking the question uh whether or not
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
there's typically something a standard
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
and statute that we've been using
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
because it seems like it's typically a
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
two-year process with the other things
 
04:11:09.389 --> 04:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
that we've written and that might be
 
04:11:11.109 --> 04:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
difficult at times with this a it would
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for us to add
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
a span for the maximum length of the
 
04:11:17.760 --> 04:11:18.670 align:start position:0%
a span for the maximum length of the
conditional

04:11:18.670 --> 04:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
conditional
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
license two years is probably right
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative to your
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
point to under RSA 3108 the licenses
 
04:11:29.710 --> 04:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
terms under LLC are two years I I was I
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
was imagining this would happen sooner
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
than that two-year period and would get
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
somebody on to full lure but I suppose
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
if you issued a conditional license they
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
hadn't met their criteria in two years
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
that would have to be renewed if
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
possible yeah and my assumption would be
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
that you could get it renewed but I just
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't it's not specified and I wasn't
 
04:11:50.429 --> 04:11:50.439 align:start position:0%
sure if that was couldn't remember if we
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
had specified it more clearly in law
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
already or not
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
so okay Roby and then L thank you madam
 
04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
chair um is you said the line five with
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
the IM uh legal immigrant status in
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
United States you said you verify Social
 
04:12:16.149 --> 04:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
Security and tax ID number corre and
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not a lawyer but those are only
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
if you are legal is when you get those
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you're not you don't get it so that
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
would come as so the question is do the
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
things you
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
verify legal stat I don't think you need
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
to be a citizen to or even be in the
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
country to get attx ID
 
04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
number so for example we have
 
04:12:43.229 --> 04:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
accountants who do not live in the
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
country they get lure in New Hampshire
 
04:12:47.550 --> 04:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
because they have a tax ID number they
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
could be doing business they can pay
 
04:12:51.790 --> 04:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
taxes but they're not citizens they're
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
not immigrants they don't live here they
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
just do work for people in New Hampshire
 
04:13:00.750 --> 04:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't know their status and I
 
04:13:00.760 --> 04:13:02.349 align:start position:0%
so I don't know their status and I
wouldn't

04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
04:13:04.990 --> 04:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
ask and I would say that it's probably
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for us to ask the PLC to
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
to enforce immigration
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
laws look the employer the employer
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
correct anyone else have a question
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
represent leas that's right y um so you
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned two or three issues with this
 
04:13:29.910 --> 04:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
because you sent email with those and in
 
04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
particular on the last statement about
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
revoking the licenses uh if you could
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
have some more appropriate language for
 
04:13:36.319 --> 04:13:39.429 align:start position:0%
have some more appropriate language for
it

04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.760 --> 04:13:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
sir

04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
right any other
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much we
 
04:13:54.239 --> 04:13:56.030 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much we
will

04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:13:58.990 --> 04:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I believe this will be going to
 
04:14:02.590 --> 04:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:07.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:14:12.950 --> 04:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:26.189 --> 04:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.109 --> 04:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
right you have to the
 
04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
buttone there you go thank you for the
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
record I'm Jay finy and I come from the
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
town of aworth and had been a former
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
member it seems that aworth breeds uh
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
chairman of the environment agriculture
 
04:14:50.590 --> 04:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
committee but I was a former chair of
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
the environment and agriculture
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
committee and then after that I had
 
04:14:57.070 --> 04:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
served uh for the Farm Service Agency
 
04:15:00.269 --> 04:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
USDA one of the things that's overlooked
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
in this and I think it's a very valuable
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
thing to consider is that this may help
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
with an influx of what I call large
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
animal vets as you know right now the
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has a dir of
 
04:15:17.149 --> 04:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
large animal vets and quite frankly it
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
was 15 years ago when I first started at
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
the Farm Service Agency and we had a dir
 
04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
of large animal vets then so I would
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
only encourage this committee to
 
04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
consider this bill as uh favorable and
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of it and thank you very
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you I'll be very
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
brief are there any
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
testimony anyone
 
04:15:49.109 --> 04:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
else all right seeing none I will close
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
the hearing and House Bill 1526 is going
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
to sub
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee and tomorrow we have an
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
executive session to vote on all of our
 
04:15:59.840 --> 04:16:01.070 align:start position:0%
executive session to vote on all of our
early

04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
early
 
04:16:04.269 --> 04:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
bills and I would expect people who are
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
going to be making motions to have their
 
04:16:06.640 --> 04:16:07.790 align:start position:0%
going to be making motions to have their
commit

04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
commit
 
04:16:12.109 --> 04:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
reports ready for use because I'm not
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to let you go home until you uh
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
turn in your committee report if you
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
don't I'll write it for
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
you and I won't necessarily agree with
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
you so please I will see you all
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%

tomorrow and we hope we'll get this all
done

04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
properly
