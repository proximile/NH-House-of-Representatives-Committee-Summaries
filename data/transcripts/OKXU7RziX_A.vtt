everybody we're only uh let's see we're
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven do we need a
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
no you don't need for for uh work

session yeah okay
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
um to get started in for our committee
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning I'd like to have
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa lead us in the
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
I pledge aliance to the flag of the
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
you so on our schedule this morning
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
um let's see from 930 to 10:00 we are
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
going to have a work session and disc
 
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:31.630 align:start position:0%
going to have a work session and disc
just

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
um uh three of the bills that we heard
 
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
hb77 so I guess I'd like to get started
 
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
discussions from members of our
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
committee I don't know if there's
 
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the hallway there that
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh coming in no okay um so we had uh HB
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
505 allowing the sale of freeze-dried
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
foods produced in Homestead food
 
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
operations and I'd like to entertain any
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
conversation or discussion about uh that
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard representative coma
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I believe um
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the bill could use a little
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
tweaking and I think um
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
because uh you know there were some
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
concerns but if we add it in uh the sale
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
of Freez dried processed
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
foods um so they're taking foods that
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
have already been processed already been
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
approved uh for sale um I think that
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
might be a good change and also making
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
sure that they're using a
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
freeze dried machine not a dehydrator or
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
oven and I think because that gives you
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
more control over the uh moisture
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
because the moisture content is really
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
key and that can control the moisture
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
content um that's just some of my
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that particular Bill do you
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
think that um the line right now we have
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
food the line on page one line 11 that
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
says food is freeze-dried shall not be
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
considered potentially hazardous food so
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
your idea would be processed food that
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
is freeze-dried shall not be be
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
considered potentially hazardous food um
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't I I don't know do we need to
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
put in uh shall not be considered
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food or just
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess you know there's that section
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
there but I mean I think the key is is
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
if they freeze dried food um shall
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
be from processed food I mean because
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
obviously if they're
 
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.269 align:start position:0%
obviously if they're
buying

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
buying
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
something right whether it's ice cream
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
or something that's already processed
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
you would think that
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's we allow the sale potentially hous
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
his Foods in grocery stores all the
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
time pro pro processed foods and I think
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
adding the processed food part really
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
covers you because that doesn't mean
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
that eliminates raw meat um and I think
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
raw chicken because that's not
 
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.870 align:start position:0%
raw chicken because that's not
necessarily

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
processed um um when we're talking about
 
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
Fe freeze drying um I'd like the ability
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
though to for for them to be able to
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
also freeze dry berries uh fruit and
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so I I'd kind of like
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
to add that into so maybe it's processed
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
food and um berries because I'd be weary
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
of letting saying all fruit because
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
watermelon which has such a high water
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
content I would be concerned with and I
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone would really freeze
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
dry watermelon because of the high
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
moisture content of it but I think if we
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
limit it to berries as a start I mean
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
this can always be amended down the road
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
but if we want to look at food safety we
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
can start off with processed in berries
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay my my other thought in terms of any
 
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
kind of amendment would also be to
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
include that they must use um commercial
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
equipment um okay so you know what is a
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
commercial uh freeze dryer right so who
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
determines commercial okay a
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative guber then
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
Barber uh uh thank you uh Madam chair
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
the um similar to that last suggestion
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
is perhaps on line uh 11 we could use
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
fruit and dairy products rather than um
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
those are the two that uh would not
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
include meat obviously and uh it would
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
fit into the I think what the intent
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
was okay represent
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
Barber sorry I have two comments so I'm
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
wondering with um defining what can be
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
used is it possible to put a per food
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
that has a percentage of
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
water in it so for example berries are
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
different than peaches and plums but if
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
we could find a percentage rate that
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
would work uh to be more
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
inclusive is that something to consider
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
I I mean you know I I don't I don't know
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
that the water content really has any
 
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
bearing on it I mean the machine is
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
supposed to dehydrate or freeze and then
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
take the water out okay and so I think
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
if you have whatever specific settings
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
on the machine to do that and it
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
measures that then I don't see really
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
why there would be a distinction of
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
making um you know that provision yeah I
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
agree with you that we you know to limit
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves um would limit our Farmers so
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
um so far as the types of fruit I think
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
that that's what you mentioned I mean
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so far as like processed food versus
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
nonprocessed food um I I would probably
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
specify um anything that wasn't a meat
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
anything that wasn't meat because I mean
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
I I guess meat kind of was more of a
 
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.389 align:start position:0%
I I guess meat kind of was more of a
problematic

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
thing represent Bixby and yeah so I
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
think my my fundamental concern is just
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
the the phrase that food that is freeze
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
dri sh shall not be considered
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous um having that as
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
a blanket St statement uh basically
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
um creates a way of making something
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
sort of Legally not hazardous that is
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
not attached to reality uh because uh
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
whether some the the the fact of the
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
process of freeze drying something does
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
not remove hazards that were in the in
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
whatever was freeze-dried so I I have a
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
problem with that phrase and think that
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
if we want to allow certain freeze-dried
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
foods then uh what we need to do is set
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
out uh that there are certain
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried foods that are exempt from
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
this uh from from the from the condition
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
of being potentially hazardous rather
 
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:52.759 align:start position:0%
than uh creating a blanket statement
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
somehow freeze drying food magically
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
safe okay um
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
so rather than saying food that is
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried should not be considered
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous we would have some
 
00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous we would have some
other

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
statement that would say that certain
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
foods that are freeze dried are not
 
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous but others are or
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
something like that something like that
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
so so that um because that's where the
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
exemption is being made is in this
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
um so uh I haven't really thought out
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
how you know how we would do that but
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
something you know um something that
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
um so I think that there
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
are some of it depends on on process you
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
I think there is there's some process
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
review that needs to happen with certain
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
fruits so berries that are you know that
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
are being that are simply being washed
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
but not otherwise processed I think that
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
would that is something that could be um
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
could be could be um you know freeze
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
drying would not be a it would be fairly
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
straightforward with that uh but uh in
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
terms of um in terms of something that
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
you need to cut up to freeze dry it uh I
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
think that there are you know there's a
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
higher level of um sort of Sanitation
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
required for that which which doesn't
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
mean that that it should be
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
automatically like you know sort of
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
Suddenly It's it's potentially hazardous
 
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.789 align:start position:0%
Suddenly It's it's potentially hazardous
but

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
um but once you get into um doing
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
certain um certain Dairy things there's
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
a much greater range for for contamin
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
potential for contamination although if
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
you're doing ice cream I I think ice
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
cream is something that is fairly
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
straightforward because if it is if it
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
is still sound as ice cream as opposed
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
to being a puddle it should be fine
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
so okay represent K thank you um you
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
know and as I said earlier I did have a
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
problem with the whole U potentially
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous food thing also um but to
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's point I think a
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
car out you know stating which foods can
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
be freeze dried but also stating that
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
they have to use a freeze dryer um in
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
the operations so that it can't be done
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
with a dehydrator or anything else and I
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
think um to start off maybe we could say
 
00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.830 align:start position:0%
think um to start off maybe we could say
whole

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
whole
fruit

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
fruit
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
and ice cream to start with because that
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
seems to be the two main categories that
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
people want to start with and see how
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
that plays out um that opens up the
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
market a lot for a lot of these Farmers
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
because um you know although some of
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
them want to do vegetables and I don't
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
know if we want to include uh vegetables
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
in that too so um but if we just spell
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
out ice cream fruit vegetables uh that
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
eliminates um meat of any kind up front
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
um although I don't like to put a lemon
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
on anything but to get the ball rolling
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
and to see how this pans out and for
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
food you know food safety you know maybe
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
this is where we
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
start uh representative H Haskins and
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
chair I confess that this um hearing was
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
challenging for me um I have great
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
respect for our Public Health Department
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
trying to protect us from ourselves at
 
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.870 align:start position:0%
trying to protect us from ourselves at
times

00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
and I also thought that the folks who
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
are working so hard to generate some
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
income and I think they mentioned yogurt
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
as one of the things so that's that's
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
Dairy I wondered if somebody could
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
explain to me what lines four and five
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
imply on page
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
two about
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
oxygenation oxygen well keeping the oxy
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
putting oxygen absorbers into the
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
packaging ensures that there isn't that
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
it absorbs any excess moisture that
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
might be on the product or prevents any
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
kind of condensation from happening
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
inside the product that would um do does
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
that answer some of the questions I mean
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about fruit but I heard
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
apples and peirs might be
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
problematic um if they were cut
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
I I still have questions about where the
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
carveout should be okay
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby next yes so um
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
actually an oxygen an oxygen oxygen
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
absorber is different from uh a uh
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
desicant oh so um maybe so an ox so an
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
oxygen oxygen absorber literally absorbs
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
oxygen and what that does is it removes
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
the so oxygen is basically drives a lot
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
of chemical reactions that degrade food
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
and uh by removing the oxygen you um you
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
basically um redu substantially reduce
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
the the rate of
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
degradation uh and if it's if it is
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
sealed and if it's freezed right and
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
sealed uh appropriately then that's
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to keep that's you're not going to
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
get more water in there but um but but
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that there is that
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
you don't have that oxygen which can
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
also degrade the food U and for example
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
they they sell beer caps that have an
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
oxygen absorber in them that will pres
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
prevent uh further reaction in in the
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
beer that you're bottling uh so uh so
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's a different technology um the uh
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
the one of so I think whole fruit is not
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
quite the term we want because as some
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
someone pointed out you know a
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
watermelon is a whole fruit uh and I I
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that anyone is going to like
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
take a watermelon and stick it in there
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
free dryer it doesn't but uh but there's
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
a um the the larger the volume of the
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
fruit the more problematic it is in
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
terms of drying it because it doesn't uh
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
because you the drying happens at the
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
surface and uh it takes a lot longer for
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
the moisture to come out of a larger
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
fruit than a smaller fruit I would feel
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
better about an apple that was cut up
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
than an apple that was freeze dried yeah
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
um representative King and then
 
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.230 align:start position:0%
um representative King and then
representative

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
ktoa so as the bill stands right now
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's um unfortunately a complete
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
non-starter for me um I think
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried food I I almost think of it
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
as like a new food group um you know
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
when a lot of these Homestead statutes
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
were written um freeze drawing wasn't
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
really a thing or if it was it was such
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
a big corporate expenditure that only
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
few people could do it and now with the
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
Advent of like small freeze dryers
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
anybody can do it so I think we need to
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
ask ourselves do we want do we want you
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
know all of the ins and outs of this to
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
be dealt with in rules or in statute and
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with statute I like that but I
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of shoehorning it
 
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
into this Homestead food license I would
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
rather it be its own subdivision or its
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
own section yeah its own section that we
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
can refer to not just for that's
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
something that's not just in the
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
homestead food license but something
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
that lots of different rsas can refer to
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
and um and what we can do then is we can
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
go through and say okay you know these
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
free Drive these free dried foods are
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay these ones aren't they need this
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
oxy oxygen absorber they need to be
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
vacuum whatever we can get really
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
thorough into that and and go over all
 
00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:42.039 align:start position:0%
the things that you know should or
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be part of it um unfortunately
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's probably too big of an ask for
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
this committee at this time I think what
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
I would be I would feel confident with
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
even though I'm not a huge fan of just
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
creating you know add in item number of
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
committees to study the issue but like
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is seems like an issue where yeah
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
if you had you know some stakeholders
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
involved and some you know Minds kind of
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the offseason getting together and
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
saying hey let's start a new section
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's just deals with freeze-dried
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
foods and really get thorough about it
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then maybe next year or something I
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
don't know um there can be a new section
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
that really deals with freeze-dried
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
foods I'd rather refer this to the food
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
safety subcommittee and and batted
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
around and see if we can come up with
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
language I'm amendable to that I'm fine
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
with that just something other than us
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
reply to something that uh
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said about um you
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
know cut up Apple and I think where I
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
misspoke is that they would get in whole
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
fruit and then from there they could cut
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
up the apple as opposed to having an
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
apple already sliced and then they're
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
trying to freeze dry it um but that was
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
my thought process because already the
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
degradation is happening once you start
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
slicing into that Apple okay
 
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza and then
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
Bixby uh thank you madam chair I um I
 
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
agree uh representative King and I had a
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
conversation about this and when we uh
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
we had a little bit of a back and forth
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
um because it having that one line
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
inserted on the bill um yeah it it it
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
didn't mesh with the entire you know
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
statute and um and I agree it needs to
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
have its its own section and it it to be
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
defined and all of that that doesn't you
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
kind of in a sense muddy the Waters of
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
what we already have currently um this
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
committee has done a ton of work I mean
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
in in just in our term our first term we
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
did a decent amount of work but you guys
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know did all the heavy lifting on
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
Homestead and changing that and
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
expanding it um so I just I wouldn't
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
want that to um to conflict that you
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
know if we're going to move move forward
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
I think it should be its own separate
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
section as well yeah you know I'll tell
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
you when um when I originally came out
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
with the dehydrated food uh dehydrated
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
meat the beef jerky bill I had a
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
separate section for freeze drying as as
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
well as dehydrating meat and um that was
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
all ripped out when uh the drafter said
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
to me oh well representative shamberg
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
has this bill about freeze drying
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
Foods so you can't both have the same
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
stuff and so I said okay well then take
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
my take the freeze dried part out and we
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
went with his bill um and when I saw
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
that all he did was just make this
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
exemption I thought for myself well
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like a real
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
oversimplified way to deal with this but
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
you know let's see where that goes and
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
in my mind yeah I I really do think that
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go down on the path of
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
um allowing freeze-dried foods which I
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
think we should because I think it's
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
something that you know our our
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
constituents are looking to do it
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
expands what they can offer on their in
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
their homesteads and um I but I do think
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
that it warrants its own section to be
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
pretty thorough in what we are allowing
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be done representative Bixby yeah I
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
like the idea of having a separate
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
section because I see this as you at the
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
moment the you know everything that is
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
get gets you know once you get Beyond a
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
certain point everything has to be in a
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen and it which is a
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
pretty broad category and it's got a lot
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
of different aspects to it some of which
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
you do need to have if you're going to
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
be U processing for freeze drying and
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
some of which are com are clearly
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
Superfluous uh and uh because there are
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
you so I think that having a separate
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
section on
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
what is specifically required for freeze
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
drying uh and having uh outlines in
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
terms of what what process requirements
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
are either are are necessary um and what
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
level of regulations so that would need
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I think I don't think that we
 
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
need to have a a huge level of
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
regulation for cutting up apples uh so I
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
don't so that's something that could be
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
in that you know clear laying out what
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
level of um process regulation you need
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
for what what types of of um processes
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
you're doing I think is would be useful
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
because it would lay out things like you
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
know someone who has a uh maybe
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
commercial grade uh freeze dryer in
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
their home uh and has basically what you
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
would you know the the quality of um of
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh kitchen that you would need in order
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
to meet the homestead food requirement
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
could uh you know could do a fair number
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
of uh things dealing with produce uh
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
starting with you know whole freshly
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
picked Pro produce and having the uh the
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
the the time Spa time scale from that
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
produce be produce being picked to it
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
being processed you know um you within
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh food safety guidelines
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh so I I think I I really like the
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
idea of doing this as a separate section
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
um I and
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what it's going to take
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
to do that but um so I think maybe first
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
sending it to the to the uh food
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then um seeing whether
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
we can do some something in the next few
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
weeks and if if it turns out that it's
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
more complicated than we can do in a few
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
weeks then uh turn it into a into a
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
study commit I I'm fully amenable with
 
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
that and um our food safety subcommittee
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
is uh me I'm chair um and representative
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
wheeler representative Howard
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative barar and representative
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
Kenny um if there's anybody else who
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
would like to join uh when I when I
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
schedule that meeting um and we can we
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
can certainly discuss uh you know how to
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
go about doing that I I'll take a a stab
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
at uh coming up with some language for a
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
separate section and we can kind of bat
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
that around and if we see that that just
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't cut it then we'll turn it into a
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
study committee representative k i I
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
think your bill HB 642 that set up uh
 
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
the dehydration of food as its own um
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
section would be a great guideline for
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
this bill okay great Y and you know I
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
have to leave shortly uh and um the
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
we're we're we didn't get to really talk
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
about 642 396 or 707 but we we
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
huh we can we can um pick up the work
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
session later on today if we have some
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
time so what I can do is I get out my
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
gavel from my bag because I didn't put
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
it on the table and um recess this uh
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
work session uh for sometime later today
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
if we have some time uh um otherwise you
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
know we can continue discussion of these
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
bills the next time we meet on February
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
on March 4th after next week we're off
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh and I could just kind of push off
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
these conversations uh to the next time
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
so pickiness I don't think you
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to reset to some to some time I
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
think there needs to be a time certain
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
rbit I don't think that's going to take
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
from 1015 to 12 okay I'd say 10:30 so
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
maybe if we recess the work session
 
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
maybe if we recess the work session
until

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
um like 11 11 o'clock okay we will
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
recess this work session that
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
us okay I I will uh recess this I'm G to
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
say 11 o'clock just to give us some time
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%

and I'd like to welcome representative
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you madam chair uh for the
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
record Peter Bixby from do straford
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
13 and um I have uh submitted six bills
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
this term so far uh and uh this is the
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
last and least of them
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay so uh there's another bill which
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to talk about in any sort
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
of detail coming up in a couple of weeks
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
that uh involved uh a that involves
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
revisiting the uh animal cruelty
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
statutes and uh as when uh a number of
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
us were preparing that bill someone
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
noticed that there was an error in
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
current law and that error is that um
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
current law reads that um anyone who has
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
in uh his or her possession an equin
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
cult that is less than 90 days old uh
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
that is not being nursed by its
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
Dam uh unless that cult was born in this
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
state and has died before the fo uh
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
before the cult has turned became 90
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
days old uh and that would be a
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh under an animal cruelty
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
same thing with selling the cult uh what
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
this means is that it is perfectly legal
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
to abuse
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
Phillies under current statute uh
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
because a cult is a male baby horse uh
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it changes the
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
word uh cult to F and makes the language
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit neater in a couple of
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
places uh and that's what the bill does
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
I hope we don't need to argue about it
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative King
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for this
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
bill um so I don't know anything about
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
horses so I just um can you just clarify
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
what a dam is and and also um maybe you
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
already did a fo a fo is just a baby
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
deer gender neutral okay I don't know
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
just if you could just
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
clarify a dam is a mother horse okay uh
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
it also I believe that there are other
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
species where the dam is ref referred to
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
as with the mother is referred to as the
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
dam as well but in this case it is a
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
mother horse um and a Colt is a uh baby
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
male horse and a fo is a baby horse and
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
um was there something else you wanted
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
to find no I think that's it now okay
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing then thank you
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to call Rob Johnson from the
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%

Farm Bureau as the federation's policy
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
director and this this is as
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
representative bi Bixby explained um we
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
we had some a proposal to amend the
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty statutes RSA 644 this
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill a bill you hearing this afternoon a
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill you'll be hearing in week after
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
next uh we we submitted to uh uh chair
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
Aaron uh uh chair today U representative
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
ktoa and representative Bixby in in um
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
seeking them to introduce it to for some
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
clarifications and and they decided to
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
split the uh request into three bills
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
this is one of them and this this is
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
something that internally we've been
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
talking about for quite some time we've
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
seen the RSA and you know uh Phillies
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
are horses too kind of thing we would
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
why why is it this way and it may have
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
been way back uh that there was an issue
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
with Colts being separated as a as a
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
guest and that was addressed but but um
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
Phillies were left out so with that and
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
there were a couple other spots we
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
thought needed some changes and again we
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
we uh made the request and we met with
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
them and and um in support and thank you
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
for your time and attention
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking questions um
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have the RSA in front of me um
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
so for my benefit maybe the benefit of
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
others on the committee and then also
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
for the public record can you just um
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
clue us in a little bit about what RSA
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
644 colon a is the state's animal
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
cruelty statute okay so so because it's
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
not really alluded to in f and g by
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
itself can you just maybe explain how
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
that cuz it doesn't really mention in in
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
I in in their animal cruelty can you
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of tie that into how it is
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
with the greater RSA itself with the
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
greater section I will I'm just looking
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
here because I think that I think that
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
there's a certain amount of um
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of the RSA already that
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
goes into the reading of this and for
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who hasn't isn't familiar with
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
that RSA at all just kind of explain it
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
to me like I'm five um so representative
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
King as
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
um Mr Johnson alluded to uh 644 is the
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
statute and there are three bills coming
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
into to change some of the language
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
there this one being the simplest of it
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
just because of the word cult um so this
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
one just deals with the ecoin section
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
and making sure that any
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
full under the under 90 days cannot be
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
removed from its Dam
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh and otherwise um you know everything
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
else remains intact under that
 
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.829 align:start position:0%
else remains intact under that
particular

00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
section um
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
so yes 644 colon8 is is titled the
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
cruelty to animals and section one of
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
that title it it it it defines cruelty
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
and then two it is a couple of
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
definitions and then section three which
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
is this is part of it it reads that a
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
person is guilty of a misdemeanor for a
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
first offense and of a classy felony for
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
a second second or subsequent offense
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
who and then I'll let ABCD and goes on
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
and this is where you see f and g if
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
that helps you okay may I have a
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
followup please okay so what what does
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
that mean to have in his or her
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
possession in in equin full I mean if
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
you have if you have the dam at your
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
farm or whatever and it has the baby is
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
that not in your possession already or
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
how I just don't I'm just not wrapping
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
my head around this I'm not seeing abuse
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
in having in possession a fo that's less
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
than 90 days old yeah Ju Just to be
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
clear that's existing language yeah yeah
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay we're not adding anything I
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm just not
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
understanding the whole thing yeah I
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
mean that would be a determination I
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
would I would assume as to whether you
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
know who had control of the care of of
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
the the animal the as far as possession
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
goes okay
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
that all right I think I'll just have to
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
spend some time on my own read rereading
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
it because I feel like there's little
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
something missing in the language here
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.829 align:start position:0%
 
colon8

00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay that particular section I'm just
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to read and is exactly what he
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
said it's a person is guilty of a
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for a first offense and of a
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
class B felony for second or subsequent
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
offense who and it goes on to list and
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
section g of that says sells an equin
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
cult that is less than 90 days
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
old um that is not being nursed by its
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
Dam or otherwise you know then it goes
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
on and and then on Section f it says has
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
in her possession equin cult that is
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
less than 90 days that is not being
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
nursed by its Dam unless the cult was
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
born in the state so the reason for this
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
particular change is because
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
as Mr Johnson said Colt only refers to a
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
male baby horse and changing it to full
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
would change the uh statute to be
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive of male and female baby horses
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very simple representative H
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair so the
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
implication is that the cult is apart
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
from its mother that's why it's in
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
possession of or it's sold um and that's
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
where the cruelty comes in it has to be
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
with mother till a certain age all right
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
right unless the dam has died in which
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
case then you have to basically hand
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
feed it or find another Dam that would
 
00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:07.589 align:start position:0%
feed it or find another Dam that would
nurse

00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
it okay okay yeah sometimes the the the
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
things that somebody would know kind of
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
go them my yeah I'm
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
sorry any other
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh that was the last pin card
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
do anyone else wishing to speak on this
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB 277
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
and uh is there a representative Scully
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
can you gr me the blue sheet on HB 277
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
please uh on online there are six people
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.589 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
me uh online six support one oppose and
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
there is nothing on the blue
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
sheet and I'd like to close the caring

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
H the time being 10:15 I'd like to open
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing for House Bill
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
779 and I'd like to ask representative
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
Bixby to introduce this and once he's
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
done introducing it to please come and
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
take a
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
seat thank you madam chair for the
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
record our representative Peter Bixby
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
from do Strafford 13 uh this bill is uh
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
was uh submitted by representative veral
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
and it is for allowing the sale of
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
rabbit meat in interest interstate
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
commerce and uh what the bill does
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
roughly is uh currently we have a uh
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
provision in state law that allows uh a
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh someone who's raising rabbits to sell
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
up to a th000 rabbits to restaurants if
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
they have taken a uh particular training
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
course to allow to um help them do that
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
safely uh what this would do is allow uh
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
the meat from un uh from uninspected
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
Rabbits to also be sold um at uh a Farm
 
00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:34.990 align:start position:0%
Rabbits to also be sold um at uh a Farm
Stand

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
Stand
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh I believe also okay
 
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:53.549 align:start position:0%
uh I believe also okay
so

00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
um represented big it's it's all right
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
so it's in the bill and so in any case
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
this would this would allow um uh it to
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
also be sold in interstate commerce and
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh we can have more discussion of what's
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
involved in that once we have someone
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
who knows it
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
Jasper commissioner of the Department of
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food uh I'm here
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
just with some concerns about the
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
language in the bill I leave it to uh
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
HHS to talk to whether this is uh
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
permitted my reading is that under
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
federal law it is is because it's a
 
00:53:57.319 --> 00:53:58.750 align:start position:0%
federal law it is is because it's a
non-amenable

00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
non-amenable
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
species um so my my issues are are
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
really technical uh and I'm here because
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
it does cover a section of law which is
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Agriculture
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
While most of this is under uh under HHS
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
but I will point out the consist
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and problems I've seen
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
um much of what is being proposed in
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 143
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
a20a is already stated in 143
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
a20 um the definition of uninspected
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
meat is currently defined in 143 A14
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
which covers both poultry and rabbits is
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
different than what is proposed in
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
143a 20a which covers only rabbits so
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
you have uh a problem there in having
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
rabbits in two places with a different
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh definition the labeling requirements
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of uninspected poultry
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
and r by licensed restaurants in 143 a15
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
is slightly different from what is being
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
proposed in
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
143a 20a Roman 1 2 and 3 I happen to
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
like what's in there but it is different
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that the new section is
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
intended to cover both sales to
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
Consumers and sales to restaurant but if
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
you go back to what's specific to
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
restaurants you have that inconsistency
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
and RSA 2 uh 472
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
A5 which is the part that I'm concerned
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
about does not refer to rabbits and it's
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand how a section
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
that is not specific to the current
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
species could be applied to
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
rabbits um and and frankly I just I
 
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
don't think this belongs at all um for
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
instance if you use strictly and just
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
red rabbits into what is is there now
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
you would be saying that you could only
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
sell rabbit meat from September 1st to
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
April 30th I do not believe that is the
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
intent this section of law also imposes
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
regulations that are not currently
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
required when rabbit meat is sold to
 
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants but now it would apparently
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
apply to all of that and that has to do
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
with Veterinary Services lab work uh and
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
all of that um I would suggest that if
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
you think the the requirements need to
 
00:56:32.829 --> 00:56:32.839 align:start position:0%
be greater than what are there just
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
expanding the sales to Consumers that a
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
new section of law be used please don't
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
try to use 472a I just don't think it it
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
works at
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
all and that concludes my testimony uh
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so is 472a the one
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
the section that deals with cids and
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
bison correct okay so we're and and so
 
00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.510 align:start position:0%
bison correct okay so we're and and so
so

00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
basically uh that bit about the the time
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
frame which is what October to April yes
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's so that uh the animal will
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
cool down when when it's after it's been
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
slaughtered which is an issue with
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
something as big as a bison but perhaps
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
not with a rabbit yeah and there there
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
are just so many requirements there and
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
it just does not seem to be something
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
that should be applied to rabbits at all
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like uh not impose to the
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
principle of this bill you just think
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
that there have been some mistakes made
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
in the drafting that can be re repaired
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
by an amendment that focuses just on
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
rabbits I I think so and also looking
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
carefully at at a20 as it exists in a20a
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
and removing the inconsistencies follow
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
up follow up okay so for the sales to
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh we have a uh a training
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
course for safe handling that um
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
is offered through Co Cooperative
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
Extension I I haven't read this
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
thoroughly but my sense it looked like
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
that wasn't required for the sale to um
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh the on Farm sales that are allowed in
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
this so would you think that that
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
training program would be appropriate to
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
add to this yes if it doesn't cover it
 
00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:19.039 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I've been little busy
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
and I dug down into some of the things
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
and didn't quite have enough time to get
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
to that um but that certainly should be
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
a requirement is you know yesterday my
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh there was a lot I had a lot
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
of concern about um that type of issue
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
so certainly I think that um that should
 
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
be continued and uh those courses should
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
be required and and one more followup
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
this is this is sort of definitional for
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
those of the the members on the
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
committee who haven't been here forever
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
and ever just a clarification that a
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
non-amendable species is something that
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
currently uh under the jurisdiction of
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
of the USDA that's that's correct and
 
00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
that you know goes back to when these
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
species were not commonly used as as
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
meat in in Commerce Maybe by hunters but
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
um not specifically here and that's you
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
know that's fine but um yes that is what
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
it is uh I also would just for let you
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
know and I was just trying to quickly
 
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
pull it up and I looked at it a couple
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
minutes ago we currently have um 45 I
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
believe don't hold me to that number
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
exactly 45 people in the state of New
 
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.750 align:start position:0%
exactly 45 people in the state of New
Hampshire

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
who are registered as rabbit producers
 
00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
and who are current on their U uh
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
coursework with through Cooperative
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
Extension on this thank you for those
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
numbers and just uh to reiterate I had
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
spoken to the prime sponsor about the uh
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
training that is already required and he
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
he was very amenable uh to that being
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
added to this bill so uh to the amenable
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
species to the non- amenda bles yes um
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you madam
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you commissioner speaker
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question yes
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering can would you be
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
able to send the committee the list of
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
the the notes that you have there so we
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
can get the rsa's correct I can do that
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
I just noticed I'd made one mistake and
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
did a two in instead of a four but I'll
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
correct that here and that's what I was
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
worried about doing I was trying to
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
write them as you set them by yeah I I
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
will give you you uh I've only got one
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
copy but I'd be glad to uh to pass it
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
along thank you Mr Speaker any other

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
Services and with me this morning is
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
Erica Davis and she's the food
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
protection section administrator within
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
um we have some testimony to share with
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
you and you should have written copies
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
of it as as well good morning members of
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the
 
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today on HB
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
779 and a a lot of what had commissioner
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
Jasper mentioned are some of our
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
concerns as well um currently rabbit
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
meat is allowed to be sold to
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
restaurants um according to the
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
provisions of 143a 14 through 143
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
a16 it does require that rabbit
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
producers have an educational course and
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture with this bill it would
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
create a new
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
section allowing for the expansion of
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
rabbit meat to be sold at the farm a
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
Farm Stand or a farmers's
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
market it also includes restaurants in
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
this new section so effectively this
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
would create two different regulations
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
one only speaking to rabbits being so to
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants the second
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
including um Safe Handling instructions
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
labeling and also um Provisions for
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
rabbits being sold to restaurants what's
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
currently in statute now requires the
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
education and requires registration
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
whereas this new subdivision does not
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
speak to the educational requirements um
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
or the registration with Department of
 
01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
Agriculture so in turn this just it it
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
makes the
 
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.549 align:start position:0%
makes the
to

01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
um the new statute and the old statute a
 
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.390 align:start position:0%
um the new statute and the old statute a
bit

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
confusing uh we would recommend that if
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
this was to move forward that the
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
educational and registration
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
requirements be added to um the
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
me any questions from the committee
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby so uh you are
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
essentially uh don't see any problems
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
with extending the sale of rabbits to um
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
Farm Stand to at Farm stands and at uh
 
01:03:37.269 --> 01:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
farmers markets by the producer but just
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
making sure but we just need to make
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
sure that it doesn't um screw up current
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
law and that it has the same protections
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
law as long as it has the educational
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
requirements and and the registration
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
requirements yes we would we agree with
 
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.430 align:start position:0%
requirements yes we would we agree with
that

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none thank
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%

seats and uh we were discussing
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
55 and uh we we determined that that was
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
going to go to the food safety
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee comme I want to skip uh
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
over to uh HB

leave a little early and um she has some
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
additional information that she would
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
like to provide the committee with so uh
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
let me turn this over to representative

ktoa uh regarding comments on HB 396
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
exempting meat and meat food products
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
slaughtered and prepared in the state
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
for sale in state from certain
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
inspections go ahead representative com
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative and thank
 
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
you for all the committee members that
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
stayed to the end I did uh listen uh
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
online while the testimony was going but
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
I did have an appointment I needed to
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
get to
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
um so as I sat and listened and
 
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
understand that it is against federal
 
01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.070 align:start position:0%
understand that it is against federal
law

01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
currently um and as we also heard that
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
at the federal level for the last eight
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
years they've been trying to get this
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
changed and
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
from people that are both for and
 
01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.709 align:start position:0%
from people that are both for and
against

01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
this there was one person that
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
testified that has a custom meat shop
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
that is allowed to sell cuts of meat
 
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
because their animal the amenable
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
species is slaughtered at a USDA
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
facility I just handed out something
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
that is on the Department of Health and
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh site on who is allowed
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
to sell cuts of
 
01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.589 align:start position:0%
to sell cuts of
meat

01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
meat
 
01:39:02.599 --> 01:39:05.390 align:start position:0%
meat
um

01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
and the thing is is custom please
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's plenty a custom
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
exempt um can only sell quarter half or
 
01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
exempt um can only sell quarter half or
whole

01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
animal and I've read this here
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
and nowhere on this sheet does it say
 
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
that if an animal is slotted at a c at a
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
USDA facility that a then custom Meat
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
Shop can then sell cuts of
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
meat and I do believe that a lot of the
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
people do not realize that that is can
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
be done because we heard everything
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
about how it had to be slotted and
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
processed at a USDA facility
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
but then she spoke about how she is not
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
a USDA facility but can sell cuts and
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
represented Bixby has something he wants
 
01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
to say Madam chair representative Bixby
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
yes so um when we H uh the last go round
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
of study committees on um uh which you I
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
believe you organized that and we had
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
Thomas cero from the USDA here and he
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
laid out a number of different ways that
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh you you could get
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
exemptions and the there are and one of
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
those exemptions is basically what uh
 
01:40:33.589 --> 01:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
Miss Brady is doing at her shop uh where
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
it is USDA slaughtered meat but uh there
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
is an exemption for doing the cutting up
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you can get through the uh uh
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
through the USDA if you are working in
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
in a state inspected facility uh so
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
that's what she's got there so
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative um Bixby um
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
but don't you think that on the Health
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
and Human Services sheet that they
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
should have that listed that if you get
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
that done then this is how then if
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
you're State inspected then you can do
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
that we have USDA inspected facilities
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if they actually
 
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
realize that they can do that and I
 
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
think that really needs to be laid out
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
plainly uh in in in law or in a sheet
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
that this handout was directly from
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh the website yeah I would agree that I
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
would agree that we that it would make
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
sense to make sure that uh that uh DHHS
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
is aware of all the possibilities that
 
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:39.639 align:start position:0%
are available through USDA for
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
exemptions and that they are all covered
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
on the website okay representative
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair uh I
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
agree so um her testimony which she had
 
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
repeated um because
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
the committee uh that stayed and um we
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
were asking questions she she probably
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
repeated this I would say at least two
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
possibly three times in explaining her
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
um her facility how it was State not
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
USDA um and and in a sense like
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
exemption carv out um but it was you
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
know I think we were all kind of
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
surprised so I believe that the way to
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
handle this besides of course
 
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
um the documents from the agency
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
definitely have to be reflective of all
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
the options that are available for our
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
um for our meat producers but um you
 
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
know is there a possibility that we can
 
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
take you know this itl bill now looks a
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
little bit different in a sense where we
 
01:42:45.639 --> 01:42:47.510 align:start position:0%
little bit different in a sense where we
can

01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
State all of the options that are
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
available um in statute current ly for
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
um for our Farmers is that something
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we can do I I would actually
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that we retain the bill as
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to itl it because number one I
 
01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen from
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
the federal level uh in so far as
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
passing the prime act or if they take
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
any other actions through the
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
USDA and um my preference would be then
 
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill as opposed to it Ling
 
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
it um and we can have further
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
conversations next year about um what to
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
do but absolutely uh any kind of
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
documents uh that Department of Health
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
and Human Services has regarding how you
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
can get exemptions how where whatever
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
the rules are need to be complete yeah
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa and then you can
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
reply uh thank thank you madam chair for
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
that and I would appreciate if we could
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
retain this bill but I also believe that
 
01:43:55.709 --> 01:43:55.719 align:start position:0%
in listen to the discussion that an HCR
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
sending a strong message um and
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
including the Senate on that message uh
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
would be more power you know to go to
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
Congress uh would be a wonderful uh
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
thing for us to do as a state because
 
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
and representative Bixby mentioned
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
roving inspectors and you know we've
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
heard the term but the unfortunately in
 
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
the discussions with that is that is
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
used mostly in the West
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
um where it makes more sense it doesn't
 
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense here in the
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
Northeast so it's I don't I think it's
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
kind of cost prohibitive at this time
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
inspectors um but we need to figure
 
01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.070 align:start position:0%
inspectors um but we need to figure
something

01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
out if the federal government isn't
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
going to work to make small farms viable
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
and be able to sell to their customers
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
what the customers
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
want we need there needs to be a way
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
because you can sell
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
roadkill you can cut up roadkill and
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
give that you can non- amenable species
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
rabbit and poultry but amendable
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
species you know why why the carot
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
fermentable I guess is my
 
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
question represent poent and then
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah I um thank you madam share
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree I was really kind of all of
 
01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
this was a a huge uh Awakening of just
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
some stuff and I know um representative
 
01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
H Haskins felt the same way um I believe
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
that first and foremost uh and I think
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a golden nugget so
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
what we've just discovered and what we
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
heard from um from Miss batty which she
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
I I believe she's the president of the
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau I mean that's
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
fantastic um we should be getting this
 
01:45:53.589 --> 01:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
out and I mean
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS can get it out we could have that
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
come through uh commissioner Jasper and
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
so this could go out to every single
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
farmer right now as a as a notice that
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
is wanting to that has you know meat
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
wants to produce whatever with cuts um I
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
I think it's a fantastic way right now
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we can tell them hey this is the
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
steps that you can take um to to be able
 
01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
to uh apply for this type of uh
 
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
exemption love it that's perfect and and
 
01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
then in the meantime I love sending the
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
message to the federal delegation I
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
think that's um I think that's great and
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
I would love um representative Bixby it
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
would be great if you can as the ranking
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
member um you know rally up all the team
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
on your side and we we send a really
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
powerful message how that we support uh
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
this for New Hampshire and we'd like
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
something to be done um and that would
 
01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
be great if it goes on to the Senate
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
then we can have that too so I think
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot of things and I want
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
I want the bill retained as well in the
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
meantime while we're you know kind of
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
all the tools in the toolbox so yeah I
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
would um I would suggest that um
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
representative kto perhaps also
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby um work with Farm
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
Bureau to get um an HCR put together
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
that we can uh bring to the house floor
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh suspend the rules and present and so
 
01:47:20.109 --> 01:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
if you can work on that together that
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be great represent viby um so
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
there are there were a couple of
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
different options in terms of
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
resolutions uh house resolution is just
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
the house we don't it it doesn't get
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
either the weight of the Senate behind
 
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
it or the potential impediment of the
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
senate in front of it uh and uh if we
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
can get I think that it would be a more
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
powerful message if we can do a joint
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
resolution and get the Senate to join us
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
on that and I I talked to Howard Pearl
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and he
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
was not entirely convinced but he was
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
not entirely opposed so uh so I think
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
that yes Senator inis is also so um so I
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
I think maybe maybe we should um touch
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
base with senator inis in terms of uh
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
being the Mover behind that in the
 
01:48:25.149 --> 01:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
Senate but I think that if the Senate
 
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
suspends their rules and puts in a uh a
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
um joint
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
resolution that would be better than if
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
we just do a house resolution if the
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
Senate if we can't get the Senate to to
 
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
to do that then uh I think it would be
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
very straightforward to propose a rule
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
suspension and I think that it would be
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
very easy to get Judy and me and Alexis
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
and Jason all to be sponsors on that on
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
on that motion and uh and that would
 
01:49:02.189 --> 01:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
probably give us a pretty solid vote on
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
it uh and uh and at that point we could
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
do a a house resolution um and I think
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
that we' need to do the rules suspension
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
one week and then we could draft it and
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
have it ready for the next week okay
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and I definitely I I I agree with
 
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate piece I think it's a a bigger
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
punch and I and I bigger message um I I
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
think that if you know just from his
 
01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:31.719 align:start position:0%
testimony I think Senator inis would
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
would be perfect to lead that charge and
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
um in the Senate so okay so if if
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and comat and Penza
 
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
if you want um Al together work with the
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
the two people in the Senate to get that
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
done um and I I'll certainly work with
 
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh house
 
01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
leadership uh to uh put that in the
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
agenda for whatever house session
 
01:49:59.790 --> 01:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
upcoming um we can we can get the
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
resolution part done um I
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
I so so the plan would be then to retain
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
the bill and also to make sure that um
 
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
these rules or this sheet this sheet is
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
um somehow made public or uh I I pulled
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
it right off the uh internet so okay
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
right from it's a PDF you're finding
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
that there's some aspect of it that is
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
not complete well it doesn't list here
 
01:50:32.669 --> 01:50:32.679 align:start position:0%
that the USDA exemption exists about the
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
state inspected facility okay okay so um
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can draft some language to
 
01:50:42.189 --> 01:50:42.199 align:start position:0%
add to this and we can um request uh
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS to include it on their on their
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
information thank you madam chair okay
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
any any other comment or question I just
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to I didn't weigh in on the um go
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
we in retaining the bill but I think
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
that makes sense okay good good uh yeah
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative Scully hi um let me Begin
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
by saying I will vote to retain the bill
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay so which is now I did have a
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
question because one of the and again
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
I'm new to this whole issue of meat
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
processing so um it did seem like one of
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
the great concerns was having uh
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
adequate inspection and oversight here
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the small local render
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
Slaughter folks didn't have that um is
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
it does it make sense to have almost an
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
intermediate step and this may be need
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
to be done at the federal level to have
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
a licensing program so we could create
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
um licensed inspectors who could go to
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
these facilities and provide some level
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
of oversight to deal with some of the
 
01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
concerns people have about making sure
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
things are being done correctly
 
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
represent K thank you madam chair um
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
as Miss Brady said she is a state
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
inspected facility so there are state
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
inspections but a lot of uh uh they're
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
going to speak to that in a minute uh
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're raising their hand but um a lot
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the custom Meat Shops are USDA
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
inspected and the difference between a
 
01:52:14.589 --> 01:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
USDA inspected and a USDA approved
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
facility is having an inspector on
 
01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
site that is the difference but they are
 
01:52:22.079 --> 01:52:23.229 align:start position:0%
site that is the difference but they are
inspected

01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
yearly if they're USDA inspected
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
facility um so we already have you know
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
there's already that cob out there where
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
and if you go into these USDA inspected
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
facilities um a lot of these custom meat
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
shops that that have taken that step
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
or they're
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
spotless um you know having in the past
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
I no longer raise animals but having
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
done the pork and the beef
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you you know in going both
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
to USDA and
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
custom I would prefer the
 
01:53:01.599 --> 01:53:03.350 align:start position:0%
custom I would prefer the
custom

01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
custom
 
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
um and also when they talked about
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
stress on the
 
01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
animals of traveling you know to get
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
slotted it does make a difference in the
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
meat and it really does stress out the
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
animals and I don't know if you've ever
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
been stressed out but everything
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
tightens up on you you um so you're
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
taking these animals away from their
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
home where they're raised and love and
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
cared for you know even though they're
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
were they're going to be used for meat
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
um and you're you're you're putting in a
 
01:53:42.069 --> 01:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
huge amount of stress on it on them um
 
01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
for the non-amenable species and I know
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby will correct me if
 
01:53:48.589 --> 01:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong um I believe we had it so that
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
they could be slotted on property um um
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
as long as a licensed veterinarian was
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
there is that correct representative
 
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
Bixby there there are um a handful of
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
non-edible species that uh are we have a
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
a procedure set up for uh doing on Farm
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
Slaughter and
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
um that that would be bison and uh elk
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
and Red Deer uh I think those are the
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
three that are current uh that are
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
currently allowed uh not white tail deer
 
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
but the Red Deer is not native to New
 
01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is uh and they're kept in
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
um enclosures that are you know there
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
are uh fishing game rules for how the
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
enclosures need to be kept that are
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
quite thorough uh and so the idea is
 
01:54:48.069 --> 01:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
that the elk and the deer don't mix with
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
the native populations and that reduces
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
the possibility of disease transfer uh
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
but uh but we do have a a uh an on Farm
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
Slaughter uh procedure laid out for that
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
that does involve the an uh Veterinary
 
01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
inspection and uh and uh a number of you
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
basically what it takes to make a uh hum
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
Humane and sanitary Slaughter and then
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions in terms of how the meat
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be treated post Slaughter in
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
order to make in order to make sure sure
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
that it stays
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
good okay uh so just a question so is
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
that for personal consumption or does
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
that allow the sale to restaurants and
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
that allows uh sales
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
to it allows sales interstate and I
 
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
forget the exact you know whether there
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
are further restrictions on where
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
interest state that can be I think you
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
can actually I think you can sell that
 
01:55:46.599 --> 01:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
can actually I think you can sell that
through

01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
a I'm not actually I'm not I'm not going
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
to go I don't remember what the details
 
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of sales is but it uh that I
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
think it's direct I think that it's
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
direct to Consumer sales rather than
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
um uh non
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
USDA yeah you're talking about like yeah
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
seen that okay so okay so so then then I
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't as I said I don't remember
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
iser but I've seen um like
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
local sorry I haven't seen it at like a
 
01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
grocery store level but I've seen it at
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
like a local you know um like that place
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
in um that place in hookit that I talked

delicatessen it's it's a I don't know
 
01:56:41.709 --> 01:56:41.719 align:start position:0%
kind of like a farm stand that has a lot

yesterday for um the exempting the meat
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
products and from from what I can
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
understand of the woman that spoke of
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
her facility of North that's licensed by
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
us is that she is receiving USDA
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
slaughtered meat products back into her
 
01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
facility which she is further processing
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
under our license so we are not
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
inspecting the slaughter and we're not
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
inspecting the meat portion of it what
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're licensing her as a
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I don't know exactly what
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
she's licensed for right now but she
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
does have a license with us um so she's
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
either a commercial facility or a retail
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%

years but I'm sure there's just a lot of
 
01:59:51.639 --> 01:59:53.229 align:start position:0%
years but I'm sure there's just a lot of
different

01:59:53.229 --> 01:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this is like something that
 
01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily talking about all
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
the day all day long or whatever so is
 
02:00:02.069 --> 02:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
this um are you going to be able to kind
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
of give a um I know in a document it
 
02:00:05.239 --> 02:00:06.189 align:start position:0%
of give a um I know in a document it
won't

02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
won't
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily um have like a you know
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
it'll there needs to be more information
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
on here about of course what Miss um uh
 
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
Miss Brady has but is there a way that
 
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
maybe in an addendum to the document
 
02:00:23.709 --> 02:00:23.719 align:start position:0%
that if any of the people that testified
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
of course that um are wanting to they
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
take their animal and they have it
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
slaughtered and bring it back they want
 
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to have this option that she
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
has will can there be an addendum kind
 
02:00:38.669 --> 02:00:38.679 align:start position:0%
of a a stepbystep process and who that
 
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
they would contact to be able to have
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
these the same option I mean I can see
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
that there' be several that would be
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
very interested in um in doing this
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
based upon our testimony from yesterday
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
we we'd be more than happy I'm not sure
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
which document you're referring to but
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
we'd be more than happy to take a look
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
at it and and make any adjustments I I
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
want to just make sure that everyone
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
understands that they have to come in
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
and get a license with the department
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
and there are certain terms and
 
02:01:07.709 --> 02:01:07.719 align:start position:0%
conditions in which they would have to
 
02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
meet in order to get that license so I'm
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
happy to look if there's any language in
 
02:01:15.149 --> 02:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
there that needs Clarity we certainly
 
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to do that and
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
you know we can we can put information
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
out about our license but it is is it
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
would whoever's interested in pursuing
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
that would need to follow those
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and get a license and um so
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
happy to happy to look at the I'm not
 
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
sure which document you're referring to
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
but happy to look at that could I have a
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
followup sure can thanks Madam chair do
 
02:01:39.790 --> 02:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
you off the top of your head have any
 
02:01:42.669 --> 02:01:42.679 align:start position:0%
idea of costs involved or or anything
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
off the top of your head I can't
 
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily speak to that um do you know
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
how much a license is a depending on the
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
facility our licenses at the most
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
expensive our 8875 is is our highest
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
licensed cost $75 no no $875 oh $ 875
 
02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
and and just would you know if um if
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
Miss Brady is that the type of license
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
that she had so you're not sure I'm not
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
sure most most facilities are not
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
licensed with the person's name in the
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
Forefront so I would need to be able to
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
look up her um her business her business
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
information when you do find that out um
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
what type of license she possesses could
 
02:02:28.589 --> 02:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
you please let me know how many of other
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
facilities or people have that license
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
in the state I can um I don't know if
 
02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to give you the best idea
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
because they are licensed categories so
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
she could be licensed as a retail food
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
store with one food prep area which
 
02:02:49.629 --> 02:02:49.639 align:start position:0%
incorporates many different facilities
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
so that could be um you know a small
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
grocery store that has a food prep area
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
it could be a gas station that has a um
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
gotcha I get it I get it if you could
 
02:03:03.069 --> 02:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
send yeah I think if you send it to
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
Madame chair that'd be great and then
 
02:03:07.069 --> 02:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
she pushes it out to the committee I
 
02:03:09.390 --> 02:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
think we'd love to see what the license
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
is and how it's set up and that'd be
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful I just just wanted to clarify
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
that we are still beholden to the USDA
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
rules sure um by the USDA and by the FDA
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
Federal food code so when uh which is
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
what we've adopted as our as our code
 
02:03:30.510 --> 02:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
for for inspection and it would require
 
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
um in a retail licensed facility that
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
the product is either USDA meat product
 
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
or that has a state equivalent um
 
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
inspection to go along with that meat to
 
02:03:44.589 --> 02:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
be served and sold in a licensed ref
 
02:03:44.599 --> 02:03:45.669 align:start position:0%
be served and sold in a licensed ref
retail

02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
retail
 
02:03:48.549 --> 02:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
facility and if I just may add and the
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't oversee a meat inspection
 
02:03:55.549 --> 02:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
program so there you know New Hampshire
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a state equivalent program
 
02:03:59.549 --> 02:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
that would fall more under the
 
02:04:01.069 --> 02:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture I think there
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
is something in Statue but I don't think
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
there's anything that supports the
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
program so that doesn't fall to the New
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
Services I just wanted to make that
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
clear to the committee that would fall
 
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
more likely any kind of state program
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
Meat Inspection program would fall more
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
towards Department of Agriculture
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
represent com talk
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
for being here so I guess the disconnect
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
and and I I I think I'm still hearing
 
02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:30.629 align:start position:0%
and and I I I think I'm still hearing
the

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:35.549 --> 02:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
disconnect is you keep saying USDA
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
approved but she's only doing USDA
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
Slaughter and then she's bringing that
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
back to her retail facility to cut up
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
and sell cuts of meat and also use those
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
cuts and those products in prepared
 
02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
cuts and those products in prepared
foods

02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
foods
 
02:04:56.109 --> 02:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to figure out how we
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
go from a USDA slotted to a retail
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
facility that can sell cuts when you
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
keep when everything else that we've
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
heard says that to be USDA approved it
 
02:05:11.709 --> 02:05:11.719 align:start position:0%
has to be also processed at a USDA
 
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
facility I'm I'm I'm not see I'm I'm I'm
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's a disconnect somewhere and I'm
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
trying to find out where that disconnect
 
02:05:18.119 --> 02:05:24.229 align:start position:0%
trying to find out where that disconnect
is

02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
so there are also um let me see how I
 
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
can a grocery store could essentially do
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
the same thing get a larger cut of USDA
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
inspected meat products and cut it
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
further and sell it direct to to the
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
consumer and they're inspected and they
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
have a license with and they have a
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
license with food protection with
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
Department of uh Health and Human
 
02:05:51.149 --> 02:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
Services to be a re retail food
 
02:05:51.159 --> 02:05:52.790 align:start position:0%
Services to be a re retail food
establishment

02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
so it's no different they can't take a
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
custom cut right they couldn't go
 
02:05:59.709 --> 02:05:59.719 align:start position:0%
through a custom cut and then further
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
cut it they have to go to a USDA
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
processing facility and get a large cut
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
and then once they have a food
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
protection license with us they can
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
further cut that but again the USDA side
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
of it is not doesn't fall within it's a
 
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
requirement but it doesn't fall within
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
DHHS that those rules are separate
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
that's Federal and then state state
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
agriculture thank you okay represent
 
02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:30.910 align:start position:0%
agriculture thank you okay represent
Penza

02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
Penza
 
02:06:35.470 --> 02:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
um what you just said though is is in
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
the meantime where we're waiting for
 
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:39.320 align:start position:0%
things to change because I understand
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to you know we're
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
following we're going to have to follow
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
federal law and state law and all of
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
those types of things this is this could
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
be a pathway for you know maybe a dozen
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
different type producers to do exactly
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
that because they're in a sense they're
 
02:06:58.270 --> 02:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
some of them are doing everything right
 
02:06:58.280 --> 02:06:59.950 align:start position:0%
some of them are doing everything right
now

02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
um they're doing all this whole process
 
02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
where they're they're taking their
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
animal they're having it slaughtered and
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
they're bringing it back but they are
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
not further you know they are selling
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
half quarter whatever but um what she's
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
doing uh Miss Brady she wants to be able
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
to slaughter she doesn't want to have
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
have to take it anymore she was clear
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
about that so we're not going to solve
 
02:07:30.189 --> 02:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
that here but what can be solved which I
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
actually think could provide relief to
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
so many of the people that came here to
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
testify is what she does have and uh and
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
I think that would be fantastic um so I
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
just hope that we can make this a nice
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
smooth process and um I'm really excited
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people that have been maybe
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
frustrated um with certain things that
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
are happening um you know within their
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
business sure the one thing I'll just
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
note is some of the testimony that I
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday was the was around uh
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
the need to take you know the
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
frustration around getting uh a spot if
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
you will at a USDA facility and I just
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
want to make the
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
committee understand that what you know
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
what a license through us to process
 
02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't alleviate the need to still go
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
through a USDA so that doesn't really
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
address the concern about sort of that
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
bottleneck if you will it's still a
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
requirement we understand that and I I
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
would love for the committee to try and
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
find out ways in which we
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
can help establish more USDA facilities
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
Slaughter facilities in the state I mean
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
I know I know that through testimony we
 
02:08:48.549 --> 02:08:48.559 align:start position:0%
heard some people say it's just way too
 
02:08:51.069 --> 02:08:51.079 align:start position:0%
expensive for me to become a USDA
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
inspector Ed facility um and and I
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
wonder if you know there's some some
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
kind of way in which a fund can be set
 
02:09:03.709 --> 02:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
up or some funds can be granted or
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
whatever to help local farmers uh you
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
know afford that or subsidize that piece
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm just dreaming here
 
02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:15.709 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm just dreaming here
represent

02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
Bixby so
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I have here a um explanation from the
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
USDA about the excuse me um retail
 
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Central Kitchen exemption
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
which I believe is probably what uh Miss
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
Brady is operating under uh so
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
operations traditionally and usually
 
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
conducted at retail stores restaurants
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
and Retail type establishments that
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
offer meat and meat food products for
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
sale or service to household consumers
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
generally are exempt from mandatory
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
inspection only inspected and passed
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
meat and meat food food products those
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
bearing a mark of inspection may be used
 
02:09:57.390 --> 02:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
in the preparation of products sold
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
including meals at retail stores or
 
02:10:03.149 --> 02:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
restaurants so um what that when it says
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
U the the bearing the mark of inspection
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
that would either be a USDA inspection
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mark or if there was a state inspection
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
program uh then that state inspection
 
02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
program Mark so
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh so basically if you're operating
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh if you have an operation where you
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
sell meat at retail you can take uh meat
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
that has been uh slaughtered with a USDA
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
inspection and then process it further
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
in your operation to sell it at retail
 
02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah is can you um get a copy of
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
that and send it to me or send me the
 
02:10:48.510 --> 02:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
link of where that is to send it to the
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
committee I'll send it to okay good
 
02:10:53.149 --> 02:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
enough thanks represent uh come thank
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
and so I'm listening and you know we've
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
heard testimony about USDA facilities
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
non USDA facilities I'm wondering and as
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
an option that you have just a USDA
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
slaughter house not somewhere where they
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
actually process meat but just
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
Slaughter um I think might be a middle
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
ground and someone may be willing to do
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
that I also believe
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
that the bottleneck at these USDA
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
facilities is not so much the slaughter
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
of the animals as it's the hanging space
 
02:11:32.109 --> 02:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
and their freezers so if someone was
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
able to bring animals to have them
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
slaughtered on site um to the usdaa
 
02:11:41.229 --> 02:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
facility they would then be taking them
 
02:11:43.709 --> 02:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
back with them at the same time so they
 
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to be hanging because they
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
would have their own coolers and things
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
to that effect so I I don't think that
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
the bottleneck that we're seeing now uh
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
would prevent additional Slaughter it's
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
all about the hanging
 
02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
space interesting point representative
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
so when um representative Bixby was
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
speaking I was thinking exactly what
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative compto was so think about
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
this business idea representative
 
02:12:16.030 --> 02:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
wheeler we could we could get into
 
02:12:17.470 --> 02:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
business together because you look very
 
02:12:19.709 --> 02:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
interested in this subject so we could
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
have literally like a rolling
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
slaughterhouse like literally it's a big
 
02:12:29.549 --> 02:12:29.559 align:start position:0%
huge you know roll you know on a I don't
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
know if you want to call it a you kill
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
them we chill them yeah is that it it's
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's literally fantastic I
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
mean you know these people drive these
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
campers around I'm serious so we could
 
02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
literally handle new hand share I I'm
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
not I can't but I think it's a fantastic
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
business model and I I I'm going to
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
invest in it so I'm totally serious is
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
what do you think course we have the
 
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
vegan in the back of the room who's just
 
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
horrified of the whole thing I know I
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
know I'm so not an animal killer but I I
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
I just really feel feel that it is oh my
 
02:13:06.549 --> 02:13:06.559 align:start position:0%
gosh what a business model and and dhss
 
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
they look at look it they're loving it
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
so represent Bixby so um I have asked
 
02:13:12.669 --> 02:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
about that model that you're talking
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
about I believe that Rob Johnson might
 
02:13:17.790 --> 02:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
know about it a bit about it too um but
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I have asked you know why can't we
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
have mobile Slaughter fac facilities in
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh and part of the
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
answer is it would be totally legal and
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
the other part of the answer is that
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is something that they do out west
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
and part of the challenge is that the
 
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
cost per Slaughter goes up
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
substantially so if you're taking your
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
mobile Slaughter facility to a ranch
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
that has you know several hundred head
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
and you're Pro and you're doing them all
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
there and then moving on to you know
 
02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:00.599 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next one then that
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
becomes you know you can do it at a at a
 
02:14:07.549 --> 02:14:07.559 align:start position:0%
price per animal that will make the meat
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
affordable if you're doing it if you're
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
going from one Farm to another Farm
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
where they each have like three or four
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
animals that need to be slaughtered it
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
suddenly the per animal price just
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
Skyrock and that's and people have I
 
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
think people have looked at the
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
potential of this and said I don't think
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
we can afford to do this I mean I would
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
love if someone would you know figure
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
out a way that they could afford to do
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
it uh it is a known technology but I'm
 
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
not sure but I think the impediment is
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
actually the business the I I think
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
there are business impediments to it
 
02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
that um we can't legislate and I don't
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
but we might not get someone to say oh
 
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to to lose $100,000 a year so
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
I can have good slaughtered meat in New
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but but that model is not
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
illegal to do here in New Hampshire oh
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
that model is entirely legal it is just
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
you need to get someone who either can
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to make it sufficiently
 
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
efficient that they'll be able to set
 
02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
that the meat can be sold at a
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable price or uh well I guess
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's the question you you you need to
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
get someone who can
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh can figure out how to do it at a
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
price point that's workable and that's
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that's an an impediment that we have
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
you know with a lot of what we're doing
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of the issue is not that we have
 
02:15:38.709 --> 02:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
that there's a legal impediment to
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
having a federally inspected uh uh
 
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
Slaughter location it is that doing that
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
is it it's a difficult business
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
proposition which means that people
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
aren't just jumping in to do it correct
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on this
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill okay um I think we we uh have a
 
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
plan for this and
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh we can move on to talk about I know
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
we discussed the um freeze-dried foods
 
02:16:12.119 --> 02:16:13.589 align:start position:0%
we discussed the um freeze-dried foods
HB

02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
HB
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
505 um and that is going to be discussed
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
by the Food Safety Committee so I'll
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
have to set up a time for us to meet
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
meet um and then we can talk about HP
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
642 which is sort of a companion bill to
 
02:16:30.669 --> 02:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
the freeze-dried foods which was um the
 
02:16:34.110 --> 02:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
dehydrated meat or the jerky bill with
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh with the committee we can discuss
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
that now too if you want anybody had
 
02:16:43.469 --> 02:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
comments about HB 642 I know I did have
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
an intention to uh make some changes to
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
that bill already because uh number one
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the drafting error on um line five on
 
02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
of the drafting error on um line five on
page

02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
one uh which the drafter put in the
 
02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
words freeze dried which is not what
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
this is about this is about dehydrated
 
02:17:05.469 --> 02:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
food and
 
02:17:11.709 --> 02:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
um also I wanted to to include a
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
um uh a part section uh having to do
 
02:17:17.469 --> 02:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
with limiting the amount of uh
 
02:17:19.469 --> 02:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
dehydrated meat that can be produced on
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
a weekly
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh or daily b or so produced on a weekly
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
basis sold on a daily basis that uh was
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
was uh inadvertently left out of the
 
02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
draft so uh any other comments or
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions about um this particular
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Bixby okay so this
 
02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
is limited to a meat producer
 
02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
distributor who has a licensed to sell
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
USDA inspected meat right yes
 
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
so um and and and the the constituent
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
who asked me to present this bill um he
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
does have a
 
02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
USDA you know inspected well producer
 
02:18:01.399 --> 02:18:03.070 align:start position:0%
USDA you know inspected well producer
distributor

02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
distributor
 
02:18:08.429 --> 02:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
license so he said you know I he he he
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
raises livestock gets them
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
um uh slaughtered and cut up whatever
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
for uh for his farm and then he he
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
brings that back okay so he has so um
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
both the slaughtering and
 
02:18:33.150 --> 02:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
the um and the cutting up of cutting it
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
up into uh retail Cuts is done off
 
02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
offsite I believe so I I would have to
 
02:18:43.150 --> 02:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
um confirm that with him but I think
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
that that's the case so he does so
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
basically he has a retail setup where he
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
likes has freezer freezer and stuff yes
 
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
and but he doesn't have a commercial
 
02:18:59.950 --> 02:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
kitchen or anything like it correct okay
 
02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:03.190 align:start position:0%
kitchen or anything like it correct okay
um

02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:04.209 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:19:04.209 --> 02:19:04.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:04.219 --> 02:19:08.389 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether uh this is the best way to best
 
02:19:21.389 --> 02:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
place in statute to to do this and
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
whether this is the best way to do it um
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
but um I think this I think it might
 
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
make sense for this to go to the
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee also yeah we'll discuss
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
this as well and I think that um I think
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
that we probably want to get food
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
Protective Services there to help us out
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
figuring out what the best way to have
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
this because it looks like there's a
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
certain amount of process information
 
02:19:48.309 --> 02:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
which might belong in rules because um
 
02:19:51.309 --> 02:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
process information you there can be
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
changes in terms of recommendations from
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
from the FDA in terms of process that
 
02:19:59.710 --> 02:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
could be might and they might be just
 
02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
minor tweaks but it's a minor tweak that
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
is easier to do in rules than like
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
turning it putting in a whole new bill
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
so some of this might not make sense to
 
02:20:13.230 --> 02:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
put in statute uh and uh but I there's
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
also uh but making sure that the process
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism is properly reviewed on I
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
think is important the body of all of
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
this you know about you know sanitation
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
and uh Fahrenheit that you have to steam
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
or roast the meat or um you know the
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
dehydrated meat process and so forth I
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
took that totally from the USDA website
 
02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
okay which which I think makes sense
 
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and this is exactly the procedure
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
that uh the the um my constituent
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
follows as well okay so you know he says
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you do it this way there's there's no
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
risk at all for any kind of food illness
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
so I think the the the challenge here is
 
02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
is not you know I I think my sense is
 
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
that given the amount of um safeguards
 
02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
you have in in the bill it does you know
 
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
the concept works it makes sense it's
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
just a matter of how to put that into
 
02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
Statute in a way that will make it um
 
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately operable okay and I think
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
that getting some help from food
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
protector services on that would would
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
be useful uh and it look like you wanted
 
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
to jump
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
in come on
 
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
up should represent
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
Penza just thinking from all of our
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
previous conversation would because this
 
02:21:43.150 --> 02:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
person is already USDA certified right
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
um or a facility they're already doing
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
Cuts in retail
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
would this kind of apply in a sense
 
02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
could they have this in a sense
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
exemption or no because it's like a a
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
different way that they're processing it
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
because they're doing something else
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
further with the meat do you know what
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay I think I understand what you're
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
saying and the the question is INS the
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
question is so is there is their current
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
level inspe of inspection sufficient to
 
02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
allow them to do this and um uh and you
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
know or is is there something that has
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
to do with their the way they are
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
processing that would require a separate
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
or different level of inspection and I
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
think that's and figuring out how to do
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
that appropriately in statute and Rule
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
is something that we need to uh have
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
some help with some experts on and you
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
know and I to be fair I had hoped that
 
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
he would have come yesterday to testify
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
or at least Supply us with uh written
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
testimony I guess he's been real busy
 
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
with his farm and and his livestock um
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
but I would like to have him come and
 
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
and explain to us or at least to the
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um exactly what his
 
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
procedures are how he's licensed and uh
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
and what he does um it's just that right
 
02:23:14.590 --> 02:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
now uh according to statute he doesn't
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
have the ability to uh dehydrate any of
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
his meat um what he does is just for f
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
friends and family um he would really
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
like to be able to sell it to the public
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
and the public would really like to buy
 
02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
it from him and that's where the problem
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
is or the issue so representative Bixby
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry go ahead and I would just
 
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
like to point out so as we testified
 
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday the concern around this is the
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
fact that it's currently it's under the
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
homestead exempt so it doesn't require a
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
license from us they can just do it we
 
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be there doing the inspection
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
and I just want to point out what we
 
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
just talked about with 390 House Bill
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
396 as a is a person that has a us you
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
know takes their meat has it slaughtered
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
at a USDA facility brings it back in and
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
has a license with us to process that
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
meat and I think that's the Department's
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is that currently this
 
02:24:15.269 --> 02:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
dehy the way this the bill is written is
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
this exempt this would allow them to be
 
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
license exempt so there would be no
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
license from the Health and Human
 
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
Service is no inspection and that's
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
concerning to the department and that's
 
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
what our testimony is about is is to say
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
per you know perhaps it's better to have
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
a license with us and and it's done at a
 
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
at a at a facility at a commercial
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
facility um similar to um the woman that
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
testified yesterday for 396
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
so and I so currently just just so you
 
02:24:49.269 --> 02:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
know so if if this gentleman wanted to
 
02:24:51.389 --> 02:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
take his USDA flattered meat and to make
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
the jerky there is a PA a licensed
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
pathway forward for him to have um a a
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
retail or commercial facility where he
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
could further process um further process
 
02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
the meat into so what would be required
 
02:25:06.510 --> 02:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
for him because what I understood from
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
him would be that he would have to
 
02:25:11.269 --> 02:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
invest in getting a commercial kitchen
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
three Bay sink have you know a whole
 
02:25:16.269 --> 02:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
bunch of other stuff and he he said to
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
me that that was cost prohibitive for
 
02:25:21.469 --> 02:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
him and and that is the barrier so for
 
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
him at this point licensing would
 
02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
require those things yeah um and we
 
02:25:27.269 --> 02:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
would ask for a process review and to
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
have a plan in place to make sure that
 
02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
all those dehydrated safety parameters
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
met and I and if I just add um I know
 
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
during the summer when we met and talked
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
about various
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
um uh food processes including
 
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
dehydration and and freeze drying there
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
was a a woman who who came and spoke to
 
02:25:49.469 --> 02:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
us and she runs a business where she
 
02:25:52.429 --> 02:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
rents out commerci space so and and I
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
know that there's at least one possibly
 
02:25:57.429 --> 02:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
more so that is also an option while
 
02:25:59.469 --> 02:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
it's not you know it doesn't
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
meet uh you know to be able to do it in
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
their home um but there is a step in
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
between going from a full-on commercial
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen yourself to renting some space
 
02:26:13.469 --> 02:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
in a commercial K in a commercial
 
02:26:15.269 --> 02:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
kitchen that is license so they can go
 
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
and do their their thing but they
 
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do the full investment
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
at their property or there or buy a you
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
know brick and B brick and mortar space
 
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
to have a commercial grade kitchen so
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
there is some some space in there yeah
 
02:26:32.190 --> 02:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
but let's face it I mean then you have
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
to bring your dehydrators over there and
 
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
you there has to be a time where you
 
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
need to keep an eye on it that you make
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
sure that you know that everything is
 
02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
running the way and it's really it's not
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
practical to do it that way to to be
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
able yes there are commercial kitchens
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
you can rent the space you can rent the
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
time but to do a process like this
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
through that
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism it's just not practical
 
02:27:03.269 --> 02:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
practical or workable and it may even be
 
02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
very expensive for the producer too so
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a whole lot easier if
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
they are um able to do this in their in
 
02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
their own space that's all we're looking
 
02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
at uh representative wheeler
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
just to add on to what you said Madam
 
02:27:24.269 --> 02:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
chair and the renting of a space or
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
something along those lines I mean these
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
businesses are not operating at huge
 
02:27:30.910 --> 02:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
profit margins you know they don't
 
02:27:32.429 --> 02:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the capital to be able
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
to go out and rent a space in their
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
business which is which is why he
 
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
approached me and said you know I'd
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
really like to be able to do this
 
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
without having to establish an entire
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen to do
 
02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
it so represent Bixby yeah so one
 
02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
possibility I'm envisioning is um
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
looking at whether there is a a sort of
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
scaled down version of a commercial
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
kitchen that one could set up just for
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
dehydrating and freeze drying operations
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have as as large an
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
overhead cost as as a as a fullscale
 
02:28:13.469 --> 02:28:13.479 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen yes I wonder would
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS have any kind of recommendations as
 
02:28:16.479 --> 02:28:17.429 align:start position:0%
DHHS have any kind of recommendations as
to

02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
a minimal
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen operation that
 
02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be like
 
02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
fullscale three Bay sink uh you know
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
separate um bathroom facilities and
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
seating for so many people or whatever I
 
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean there's a there's a
 
02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
lot and it's a huge investment for many
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
people and that's the barrier that's the
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
thing that's really getting everybody um
 
02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
wanting to not get these Homestead
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
licenses is because it it's it's just
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
such a
 
02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
hassle and when you want to do something
 
02:28:58.269 --> 02:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
fairly uh you know simple like freeze
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
drying or or
 
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
dehydrating even even you know people
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
have complained to me oh I need to have
 
02:29:08.269 --> 02:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
a whole commercial kitchen if I want to
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
sell cut up apples or if I want to cut
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
up an onion and put it on this hot dog
 
02:29:16.469 --> 02:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
that I'm selling you know I need a whole
 
02:29:19.309 --> 02:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen to do that and it
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
just it's sort of of goes against um
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
whatever common sense I don't know but
 
02:29:26.399 --> 02:29:29.150 align:start position:0%
whatever common sense I don't know but
just

02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
saying and I think it comes back to
 
02:29:34.349 --> 02:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
looking at you know for Homestead food
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
operations that do um nonp potentially
 
02:29:39.429 --> 02:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods absolutely like there
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
are when and it's currently allowed it's
 
02:29:45.070 --> 02:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
when we move to potentially hazardous
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
foods and that's when the risk to the
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
public goes up and that's when you're
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
going to hear our concern so it's not so
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
much the non-p potentially hazardous
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
foods that's allowed and um you know we
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
don't we see that as a very low risk
 
02:30:03.550 --> 02:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
it's when we move from allowing exempt
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
homesteads or Homestead operations to
 
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
start processing potentially hazardous
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
foods without lure um that's when risk
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
to the public goes up and that's when we
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
processes any other questions or
 
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
comments representative guber uh thank
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
you very much um I'm doing more
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
listening than talking but it seems to
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
me that uh we have a scaling issue here
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to support homesteads
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
where they could do things that might be
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
hazardous food but in a very minor
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
Manner and um so we have like either up
 
02:30:43.150 --> 02:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
here or down here and we need to think
 
02:30:45.269 --> 02:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
about is there possibility without
 
02:30:47.309 --> 02:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
adding significant risk to the public
 
02:30:49.630 --> 02:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
that we could actually have two or three
 
02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
options of semi-commercial kitchens and
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
so forth so that we can balance the
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
issue of safety I mean you never could
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
be at 99.99 we never get 100% but with
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
some of these processes they don't seem
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
as risky if you have good protocol so
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
the question is has the agency looked at
 
02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
kind of different scales of commercial
 
02:31:14.590 --> 02:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
kitchen for type application so that it
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
the need can be in line with balancing
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
risk versus the cost so that we could
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
actually promote more homesteading over
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
that sort of work and then and then to
 
02:31:24.510 --> 02:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
your point I mean that's why I wanted to
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
put a limit to how much they can produce
 
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes I mean if you if you're sort of
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
restricting the amount you're
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
restricting the risk um right I want you
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
to answer his question and then
 
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative patens I had a question
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and I I
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your what you're saying and
 
02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
your concern the challenges around
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
freeze drying and dehydrating and we
 
02:31:50.110 --> 02:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about this in Our
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
Testimony yesterday is that the process
 
02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
itself um really needs review by uh by
 
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
experts so the food experts and that
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall back to the department so
 
02:32:03.469 --> 02:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
establishing these sort of standard if
 
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
you will standard processes that doesn't
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply to everything that you
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
know you're trying to either freeze dry
 
02:32:14.429 --> 02:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
or or dehydrate so there could be
 
02:32:17.269 --> 02:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
instances where certain processes work
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
for this type of food for freeze drying
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
but you would need to do something
 
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
different if you're TR trying something
 
02:32:26.269 --> 02:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
else and that's where the challenge
 
02:32:28.349 --> 02:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
comes in because the department isn't
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
the process Authority we aren't the ones
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
that look at those you know you need to
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a food chemist to really understand
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
what happens in a process it sounds
 
02:32:39.389 --> 02:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
simple it sounds like oh I stick it in a
 
02:32:41.269 --> 02:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
machine and then it comes out the
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
product that I want but it's more
 
02:32:46.269 --> 02:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
complex than that and it does need a
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
more scientific uh review and and I
 
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
understand and can appreciate you know
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we heard from
 
02:32:56.429 --> 02:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
producers that it's challenging and it's
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a barrier but it is
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
there is a reason for it you know and it
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
and the science is you know that's the
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
the true review of the science to make
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the end product is safe for
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
the public and and that's the challenge
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
around trying to set these standard
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions in in statute because they're
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
not all applicable across every food
 
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
product but wouldn't stipulating in in
 
02:33:26.429 --> 02:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
statute that the person follow the
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer recommended procedures in
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
using their dehydrator or their freeze
 
02:33:39.269 --> 02:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
dry equipment sufficient to have that
 
02:33:41.309 --> 02:33:41.319 align:start position:0%
protection so the some of the
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers they give like a a a basic
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
they'll give the basic time and
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
temperature for individual products
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
however we know that food producers are
 
02:33:54.910 --> 02:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
um are coming up with their own recipes
 
02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
and their own um thicknesses of things
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have freeze-dried
 
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
or dehydrated and all of those
 
02:34:04.750 --> 02:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
components go into making sure that the
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
freeze dryer and the dehydrator are
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
working the way that you want it to so
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
there are basic
 
02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturer I'm assuming there are
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
basic manufacturers that if you want to
 
02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
freeze dry uh a couple of blueberries
 
02:34:19.269 --> 02:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
then these are the time and temperature
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
parameters but when you get more complex
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
with your recipe and your procedure
 
02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
that's what the processing Authority is
 
02:34:27.269 --> 02:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
going to look at to make sure that each
 
02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
of your steps with your process and your
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
marinades and your cuts of meat or
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
slices of fruit are going to be
 
02:34:38.110 --> 02:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
dehydrated or freeze-dried enough to
 
02:34:40.349 --> 02:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's no risk for
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
growth okay representative Penza um real
 
02:34:45.550 --> 02:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
quick thank you madam chair I just want
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
to go back to um I think what
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative guber um said and then of
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
course what m madame chair was alluding
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
to as well I think it would be fantastic
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the agency to spend some time
 
02:35:03.469 --> 02:35:03.479 align:start position:0%
putting all that stuff aside dehydration
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
the freeze drying Meats all of that
 
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
let's just let's just talk simple in
 
02:35:13.230 --> 02:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
regards with licensing so if you only
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
have you know uh you know uh Homestead
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then you go up to full-blown
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
commercial I really think there should
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
be steps or stages in there and I think
 
02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
um and that goes based upon you know
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
size and and smaller versions so someone
 
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
could get into uh um could get into
 
02:35:39.269 --> 02:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
putting in you know a smaller commercial
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
have that license have that smaller
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen I mean we want to be
 
02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
able to make it possible for people and
 
02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
I can't I mean we owned a restaurant my
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
father was in the restaurant business
 
02:35:52.389 --> 02:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
for a long time I know a lot of things
 
02:35:55.070 --> 02:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
about this and I I I know that it can be
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
done and it it's amazing for the agency
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
because there's more Revenue that's
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
coming in from there as well it's it's
 
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
giving more options for the public so I
 
02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
just there there should be there should
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
be steps or stages we should really
 
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
consider that and I really hope that you
 
02:36:13.389 --> 02:36:13.399 align:start position:0%
guys bring that back to the powers that
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
be because I I think it makes sense you
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
know maybe there's for when someone's
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
going into uh commercial and it would be
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
a certain amount that they're producing
 
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
and all of that they get you know a
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
stage one license and then it goes up to
 
02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
stage three or whatever it may be but I
 
02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
I just I think that we can do that um we
 
02:36:34.590 --> 02:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
have enough expertise and uh I just
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
think that it's something that you guys
 
02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
should consider representative Bigby
 
02:36:42.429 --> 02:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so a couple things one um is
 
02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
getting back to the question of process
 
02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
review uh the process that's outlined in
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative eron's bill is
 
02:36:53.469 --> 02:36:53.479 align:start position:0%
actually drawn from the USDA so one
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
possibility is that uh for certain
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
things we could just say that the
 
02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
process needs to be a process that is
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
established by the USDA or was it USDA
 
02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
or was it uh or um was it
 
02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:37:19.710 --> 02:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
FDA this I believe uh see I think I I
 
02:37:22.349 --> 02:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
believe it was from the USDA that I okay
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
pulled that off let me just okay so food
 
02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
safety and inspection yeah us F
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
fsis okay so uh so we could have we
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
could we could reference uh existing
 
02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
processes that have been published by
 
02:37:41.550 --> 02:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government as one allowable
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
way of doing it um and so I think that
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
and rather than having all of those
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
processes laid out in the statute just
 
02:37:53.309 --> 02:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
have a reference to which processes uh
 
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
there are at at the federal level that
 
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
are sadly already established um the
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
getting um I wish that representative
 
02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
pretendo were still here because the
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
next thing was responding to hers which
 
02:38:10.389 --> 02:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
is that I think what she's suggesting
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
makes sense in the long run I think that
 
02:38:17.469 --> 02:38:17.479 align:start position:0%
it is probably not within your the scope
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
of your job descriptions to do what she
 
02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting but it is in the suggest in
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
the scope of our job descriptions to do
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
study committees to look at uh What uh
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
what different ways of setting up
 
02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
statute would be to allow that uh one of
 
02:38:36.190 --> 02:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
uh in a discussion I had with uh Miss
 
02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
savos uh a while back uh she mentioned
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
that Virginia has a different way of
 
02:38:47.269 --> 02:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
setting up their uh their licensing that
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
had does have different gradations I
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
think perhaps may be similar to what
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Penza was was mentioning
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
so we could we could look at um we could
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
look at what other states have for their
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
licensing approach approaches to
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
doing uh the the food licensing at
 
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
different levels and see if there's a
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
model that would allow for the kind of
 
02:39:18.030 --> 02:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh different gradation that uh that
 
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
representative penzel was mentioning
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
and because I I I agree that you know
 
02:39:24.750 --> 02:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
the the sort of All or Nothing approach
 
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
like you you have almost nothing for the
 
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
homestead and then you have a whole lot
 
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
for anyone who's above that uh I I think
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
that there's there is room for some
 
02:39:37.710 --> 02:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
gradation in there but I think we need
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
that needs more study than we can do
 
02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
right now yes I think the department
 
02:39:44.429 --> 02:39:44.439 align:start position:0%
would welcome that I think I think a
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
study committee would be would be a
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
great way to have you know discussions
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
and get information
 
02:39:51.790 --> 02:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a process Authority can
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
come and and talk about what they do and
 
02:39:56.030 --> 02:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
the importance of it and yes we can
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
explore different uh opportunities for
 
02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
facilities and lure because you know
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're Bound by what we what we
 
02:40:08.269 --> 02:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
have directly in front of us and so um I
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
I welcome
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
that representative King real quick
 
02:40:16.750 --> 02:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
question um do do the current statutes
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
and rules preclude barter I know you can
 
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
give away and gift um you know these
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
things but you can't sell them can you
 
02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:30.429 align:start position:0%
things but you can't sell them can you
barter

02:40:30.429 --> 02:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
them my my first thought is is no it's
 
02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
it within your friend group or family
 
02:40:40.510 --> 02:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
yes but it's food served to the
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
public so if it's if it's being served
 
02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
or sold to the public then it falls
 
02:40:48.790 --> 02:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
within um the RSA for but it wouldn't be
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
sold it
 
02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
Bartered like if I traded traded
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
dehydrated meat for some eggs at a farm
 
02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
stand would that be okay I think we
 
02:40:58.670 --> 02:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
would probably need a legal
 
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation on that I can't speak to
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
that okay but yet if you serve
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
dehydrated meat at a soup kitchen or had
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
a potluck Community potluck that would
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
be fine there's no problem with
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
that yeah anyway um I am going to close
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
out our work session I know we didn't
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
discuss hb77 but we can uh it is on the
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
docket to discuss that um on February on
 
02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
March 4th with the next time we meet
 
02:41:32.190 --> 02:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
that is included in the work session on
 
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
then and and in the in the interim uh I
 
02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
believe you had sent out um um a
 
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
preliminary amendment to that Bill yes
 
02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
which to the committee and we everybody
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
has it I spent a long time on it so I
 
02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
just um um I'd love feedback um if
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's a way that I can meet with
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I I'll speak with
 
02:41:59.550 --> 02:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
representative gerana and and of course
 
02:42:02.110 --> 02:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
representative bisy um representative
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
King if we ever if we get together if we
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't or however it may be but um yeah
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's because we weren't did we want to
 
02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
um did we want to exec on that day or I
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
don't think so I think what we're going
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
to do is is uh we'll have a work session
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
on March 4th okay and uh probably the
 
02:42:26.429 --> 02:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
week after we would exec this bill okay
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
perfect so so that'll give us some time
 
02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
I mean you sent this out this morning y
 
02:42:33.389 --> 02:42:33.399 align:start position:0%
so we really do need some time to go
 
02:42:35.590 --> 02:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
through everything in the amendment have
 
02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
everybody on the same page and
 
02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
understanding what um what the fine
 
02:42:42.670 --> 02:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
points are of of many of the sections of
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we are all
 
02:42:47.710 --> 02:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
understanding um the very important
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
pieces of um a landfill sighting that we
 
02:42:53.790 --> 02:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
are suggesting uh in in making changes
 
02:42:56.349 --> 02:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
to current rules that have been adopted
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
which we all feel are lacking correct
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
and in every single um um I haven't
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
spoken with director whims but every
 
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
single um piece that he brought up in
 
02:43:14.309 --> 02:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
his testimony has been addressed yeah um
 
02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
the stuff that I already knew was going
 
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
to be a hindrance have been addressed um
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
clarifying statements are in there um
 
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
descriptions purpose yeah this is Soup
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%

had some time and uh uh I I do
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification on uh
 
02:43:45.429 --> 02:43:45.439 align:start position:0%

02:43:57.030 --> 02:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that um director whimet had and

03:50:47.309 --> 03:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:48.870 --> 03:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
which is allowing the ownership of
 
03:50:51.030 --> 03:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
certain squirrels and
 
03:50:55.030 --> 03:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
raccoons and here today to introduce the
 
03:50:56.110 --> 03:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
us is representative Jim
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
Spain welcome to environment and
 
03:51:02.399 --> 03:51:04.550 align:start position:0%
Spain welcome to environment and
agriculture

03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
03:51:07.950 --> 03:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
committee and uh thank you pleas let us
 
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
know what what your plan what your plans
 
03:51:12.510 --> 03:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
are for this thank you madam chair
 
03:51:14.590 --> 03:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I brought
 
03:51:17.590 --> 03:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward um because of
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
the incident that happened in New York
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to make sure that uh we
 
03:51:22.830 --> 03:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
don't get a black eye in the state of
 
03:51:24.630 --> 03:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with the same sort of bad
 
03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
press um and when I looked into the
 
03:51:31.710 --> 03:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
situation and found out even further
 
03:51:35.229 --> 03:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
um what the situation could be and
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
having been a chairman on fishing game
 
03:51:39.229 --> 03:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
and knowing how our re rehabilitative
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
Services work um I felt it was it was
 
03:51:45.309 --> 03:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
something that we needed to do the bill
 
03:51:47.469 --> 03:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
is very tightly
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
crafted to allow people to have their
 
03:51:53.670 --> 03:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
pet squirrel or raccoon but put
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
guardrails around how they can get that
 
03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
and Andor um keep it um I'll start by
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
showing you uh you will have all seen
 
03:52:02.279 --> 03:52:02.950 align:start position:0%
showing you uh you will have all seen
the

03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
handout um if you look at the uh the
 
03:52:08.510 --> 03:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
page for pet
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
raccoons you can see that there are uh
 
03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
19 states where they're legal
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
31 where they're not
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
legal of those two of our neighbors uh
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Rhode Island allow pet
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
raccoons and then if you switch over to
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
pet squirrels you'll see that 19 states
 
03:52:31.189 --> 03:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
allow those and 31 don't and oddly
 
03:52:34.670 --> 03:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
enough they're not the same 19 or 31 um
 
03:52:37.469 --> 03:52:37.479 align:start position:0%
and in fact Maine and Massachusetts two
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.750 --> 03:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
pets so it's very possible that somebody
 
03:52:48.149 --> 03:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
could move here from Maine or mass or
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island or Vermont and already have
 
03:52:53.469 --> 03:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
pets and then they would be having to
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
keep it secret in the dark not taking it
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
to the vet not being able to get the
 
03:53:05.189 --> 03:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
care that it needs and not letting
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
anyone know they have it for fear the
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
fact that the being illegal the
 
03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
authorities would come and confiscate it
 
03:53:13.189 --> 03:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
it so so I crafted the bill such
 
03:53:20.070 --> 03:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
that it will allow them to be
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
possessed they call it a companion
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
animal in the law but it's basically a
 
03:53:28.429 --> 03:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
pet if they are able to acquire one as
 
03:53:30.189 --> 03:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
an adopted animal from one of our
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation Facilities or if they
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
move here with one already as a pet the
 
03:53:38.229 --> 03:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
bill specifically prohibits people from
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
breeding them or selling them and
 
03:53:42.510 --> 03:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from Catching Wild Ones
 
03:53:45.149 --> 03:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
for their own usage as a pet
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
pet but one of the problems we have with
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
our rehabilitation
 
03:53:52.349 --> 03:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
facilities and the way that the law is
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
now is that if we rehabilitate a raccoon
 
03:53:58.389 --> 03:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
or a squirrel and it's determined that
 
03:54:01.349 --> 03:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
that animal cannot survive in the wild
 
03:54:01.359 --> 03:54:03.110 align:start position:0%
that animal cannot survive in the wild
after

03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation the fishing game re
 
03:54:09.429 --> 03:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation Facilities um and I'll be
 
03:54:11.349 --> 03:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
clear they're not run and owned by
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
fishing game but they're licensed by
 
03:54:14.590 --> 03:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game as rehabilitation
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
facilities they have limited space so
 
03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're faced with a predicament of they
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
either have to keep this as their own
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
pet because they're the only ones
 
03:54:25.349 --> 03:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
legally allowed to keep it or they have
 
03:54:28.110 --> 03:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
to euthanize it and to go through
 
03:54:30.550 --> 03:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation on an animal and then
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
face the prospect of having to now
 
03:54:34.229 --> 03:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
euthanize it after all of that work to
 
03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate it is not a situation I
 
03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
want to put them into and this would
 
03:54:41.349 --> 03:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
allow those facilities to find a home
 
03:54:45.630 --> 03:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
for one and let it be adopted so that it
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
could continue living out its life
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
without Starving in the wild because it
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
can't be released to the wild or being
 
03:54:54.510 --> 03:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
euthanized immediately because there's
 
03:54:58.349 --> 03:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.510 --> 03:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
facility there's some discussion that
 
03:55:05.389 --> 03:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
the the uh State veterinarian has had
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
with me about whether or not there are
 
03:55:10.750 --> 03:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
approved vaccines for these for rabies
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
but there's other states where they're
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
legal and other states where Veterinary
 
03:55:17.670 --> 03:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
Ians are administering vaccines for
 
03:55:22.590 --> 03:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
rabies um for the raccoon it's it's
 
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
almost a one for one with whatever they
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
use for cat vaccinations for rabies
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
because they're so closely related to
 
03:55:31.630 --> 03:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
the cats for squirrels I don't know what
 
03:55:33.389 --> 03:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
they do but we allow people to have pet
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
rats and those go to the vet and they
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
get seen and squirrels are very closely
 
03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
associated with with uh the other
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
rodents and other things as well so I
 
03:55:46.269 --> 03:55:46.279 align:start position:0%
don't think it would much of a problem
 
03:55:48.550 --> 03:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
and up until about I see them in being
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
in a situation that we had with ferrets
 
03:55:52.510 --> 03:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
here in the state some I don't know 15
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
20 years ago it was illegal to have
 
03:55:55.510 --> 03:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
ferrets in the
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
state and we passed a law to allow those
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
to be kept as pets and many people now
 
03:56:02.590 --> 03:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
have ferrets and they're kept as pets
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
and they're kept healthy and they are
 
03:56:04.319 --> 03:56:06.590 align:start position:0%
and they're kept healthy and they are
kept

03:56:06.590 --> 03:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
kept
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so I don't think it would be
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
a problem for our veterinarians in the
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
state to be able to acquire and
 
03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
administer an appropriate level of
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine um keeping them vaccinated would
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
be part of this bill um so that they
 
03:56:22.279 --> 03:56:23.229 align:start position:0%
be part of this bill um so that they
stay

03:56:23.229 --> 03:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
stay
 
03:56:25.309 --> 03:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
healthy and there's another safety
 
03:56:27.189 --> 03:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
measure that I've put into the bill that
 
03:56:30.570 --> 03:56:30.580 align:start position:0%
says uh if you look at lines 8
 
03:56:30.580 --> 03:56:32.670 align:start position:0%
says uh if you look at lines 8
[Music]

03:56:32.670 --> 03:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
through uh well eight on I
 
03:56:38.349 --> 03:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
suppose this the raccoon or gray
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
squirrel shall not be confiscated or
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
euthanized without the permission of the
 
03:56:46.429 --> 03:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:50.189 --> 03:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
that is just basically to ensure that if
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
a raccoon or a squirrel had bit somebody
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
and needed to be euthanized right away
 
03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
that the owner at least had given his
 
03:56:58.110 --> 03:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
permission if there's a suspect
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
suspicion of rabies and the fishing game
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
wants to or the authorities want to uh
 
03:57:06.269 --> 03:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
confiscate it they can't euthanize it
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
without permission but they can
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
quarantine it and watch for symptoms and
 
03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
a 30-day quarantine would show symptoms
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
and it would be able to you be
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
euthanized upon first signs or could be
 
03:57:20.110 --> 03:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:23.110 --> 03:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms and with that um I'm open to
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have okay before I
 
03:57:27.389 --> 03:57:27.399 align:start position:0%
entertain questions I would like
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler and
 
03:57:32.510 --> 03:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
seats and
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I I do have h a few questions with
 
03:57:42.670 --> 03:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
this bill um I know the incident
 
03:57:45.870 --> 03:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
happened in New York New York State
 
03:57:48.750 --> 03:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
correct and I see by your map New York
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
state does not uh it is not legal to
 
03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
possess a squirrel or raccoon and
 
03:57:58.750 --> 03:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
and a squirrel or a raccoon correct
 
03:58:00.910 --> 03:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
they're in the same boat we are so those
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
yes so those folks where those animals
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
were confiscated and
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
euthanized um they had no law to protect
 
03:58:13.429 --> 03:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
no law to protect them and um both the
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
raccoon and and the squirrel had been
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated but were keep being kept
 
03:58:19.199 --> 03:58:21.070 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated but were keep being kept
surreptitiously

03:58:21.070 --> 03:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously
 
03:58:24.149 --> 03:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
secretly so what would prevent anybody
 
03:58:26.670 --> 03:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire from getting a
 
03:58:29.950 --> 03:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator license what's involved in
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
that so that they could so that they
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
could have a squirrel or raccoon it's uh
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
tightly controlled by fishing game as to
 
03:58:39.389 --> 03:58:39.399 align:start position:0%
who's licensed to be a re Rehabilitation
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
facility in the state and they handle a
 
03:58:44.110 --> 03:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
wide variety of animals that are found
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
injured on the roadside or injured in
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
the field um anything from uh baby deer
 
03:58:52.469 --> 03:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
that the mother's been killed uh and
 
03:58:54.670 --> 03:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
they're trying to save them I had one
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
instance where I saved a baby deer that
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
was being chased by a pack of coyotes
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
behind my house and we got it to a
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation facility but because of
 
03:59:04.229 --> 03:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
the amount of trauma that it went
 
03:59:07.229 --> 03:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
through just trying to escape uh it had
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
a heart attack in the facility and and
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
ended up not being able to make it but
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
it can be anything from you know baby
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
deer to Cox to owls to there's a wide
 
03:59:18.990 --> 03:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
variety of animals that they are trained
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
to take care of and they have to be able
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
to take care of them and take them in to
 
03:59:25.349 --> 03:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate them whenever fishing game
 
03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
has a need so fishing game is
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably not going to deny a a suitable
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
facility but they have to be able to be
 
03:59:37.469 --> 03:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
qualified to provide all of the medical
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
necessary uh Rehabilitation Facilities
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh medications and everything else that
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
that would be needed for any of those
 
03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
animals because I um to be honest I did
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with Dr Crawford
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
about it and he said to me well if you
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
know people want a squirrel or a raccoon
 
04:00:02.269 --> 04:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
as a pet that they can easily get a
 
04:00:04.110 --> 04:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator license and be able to
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
keep them it's my understanding that
 
04:00:08.590 --> 04:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
those licenses are not just handed out
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
they have to be um medically able to
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
care for any of the rehabilitated
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
animals that are brought their way mhm
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
do you also know uh how much it costs
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
the state fishing game uh to
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate an animal like a like a
 
04:00:26.269 --> 04:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
squirrel or raccoon if they find a an
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
injured one or a baby one or something
 
04:00:31.469 --> 04:00:31.479 align:start position:0%
that that has been abandoned H how much
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
how much time and how much money does it
 
04:00:36.269 --> 04:00:36.279 align:start position:0%
cost the state to do the rehabilitation
 
04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
well that's a that's a complicated issue
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
because part of it falls on fishing game
 
04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
to actually retrieve the animal assess
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
it and take it to the facility um a lot
 
04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the facilities work off of donations
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
and um the amount of man hours and
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
medication costs and such depend
 
04:00:57.670 --> 04:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
entirely on what type of Rehabilitation
 
04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
is needed if you're talking about a
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
broken wing on a hawk um it's different
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
than uh raising you know a baby deer
 
04:01:09.189 --> 04:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
that needed to be uh taken care of just
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
because its mother had died and it
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
needed to be old enough to be released
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
into the wild um if you've got an animal
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
with with severe injuries because it's
 
04:01:20.349 --> 04:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
been hit by a car but it's
 
04:01:22.590 --> 04:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
still in good enough shape that it could
 
04:01:24.630 --> 04:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
be re rehabilitated it's one of those
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
triage things that fish and game
 
04:01:28.030 --> 04:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
determines on on site is whether or not
 
04:01:30.030 --> 04:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
this animal needs to be put down on site
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
or whether it can be re rehabilitated
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
that could take a lot of operations and
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
could be great expense as well I don't
 
04:01:38.349 --> 04:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
know what portion of that falls on the
 
04:01:40.269 --> 04:01:40.279 align:start position:0%
state versus what portion of that is
 
04:01:42.990 --> 04:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
raised through donations and um the care
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
of the facility
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay and so also once a raccoon or a
 
04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
squirrel is rehabilitated by fishing
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
game if they cannot be returned to the
 
04:01:58.750 --> 04:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
Wild what do they do with them in that
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
instance it either has to be kept by the
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
facility okay or
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
euthanized okay so they have in essence
 
04:02:09.790 --> 04:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
spent a whole lot of time in money to
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate an animal potentially that
 
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
they would have to euthanize and there's
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
no way to tell it not going to be able
 
04:02:16.030 --> 04:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
to be returned to the wild until the
 
04:02:19.389 --> 04:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation is complete um it can be
 
04:02:23.309 --> 04:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
anything from the animal is was found so
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
young that it just doesn't know how to
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
survive on its own to it just can't hunt
 
04:02:31.510 --> 04:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
anymore because of you know the the even
 
04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
though the wing is fixed it it won't be
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
able to successfully hunt field mice if
 
04:02:38.269 --> 04:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
it's a uh like a hawk or if it was a
 
04:02:39.790 --> 04:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
raccoon or a squirrel it could be that
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know the the raccoon had a broken
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
leg and even even though it's fixed now
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
it won't properly be able to hunt for
 
04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
food okay other questions from the
 
04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee represent Bixby yeah I'm um a
 
04:02:57.950 --> 04:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
little bit um unclear on the rabies
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
Provisions here so um so it does it does
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
provide for
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
vaccination uh if there is a if if it's
 
04:03:09.750 --> 04:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
a rehabilitated animal it has to be
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
vaccinated before it's transferred to
 
04:03:14.590 --> 04:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
someone um
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
but in
 
04:03:19.750 --> 04:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
line uh line eight the raccoon or gra
 
04:03:21.269 --> 04:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
scroll shall not be confiscated or
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
euthanized without permission of the
 
04:03:26.149 --> 04:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
owner but there's not any an indication
 
04:03:30.189 --> 04:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
of why that you why that confiscation
 
04:03:33.189 --> 04:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
might occur and which is doesn't
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
although it might be you and it doesn't
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
actually say anything about specifically
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
about whether the animal has bitten
 
04:03:42.429 --> 04:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
anybody right so there's certain
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they may want to
 
04:03:45.630 --> 04:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
confiscate one of them might be biting
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
somebody and in that instance you would
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
want to euthanize right away so that you
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
could get an immediate result um for
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
rabies because you need to do that as
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
soon as possible um there's no way to do
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
that test currently without uh removing
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
the head and that requires the
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
euthanizing of the animal but there's
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
also if you look further up um one of
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
the qualifications for being able to
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
continue keeping them as a pet is to
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
keep them up on their vaccines if NE if
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
required um if an owner if you look at
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
line five it starts with uh if an owner
 
04:04:22.030 --> 04:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
of a raccoon or gray squirrel cannnot
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
satisfy the requirements of this
 
04:04:24.750 --> 04:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph the fishing game commission
 
04:04:27.309 --> 04:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
may charge them with a fine set in rules
 
04:04:30.429 --> 04:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
adopted under RSA 541a and the animal
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
shall be examined and if necessary
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in that process it would be
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
confiscated to be examined and
 
04:04:41.229 --> 04:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinated okay thank
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
you I guess there was also you there was
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
something about you said there was like
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
a quarantine period that was we didn't
 
04:04:50.590 --> 04:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
specify the quarantine period because
 
04:04:52.590 --> 04:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that could be up to
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
whoever the expert is that's watching
 
04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
the animal and whether or not it needed
 
04:04:59.550 --> 04:04:59.560 align:start position:0%
to be done immediately for a bite versus
 
04:05:01.469 --> 04:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
um it's just a suspicion because they
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
didn't stay up on their vaccines and we
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
before we return it to them we want to
 
04:05:06.990 --> 04:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
make sure it doesn't have that disease
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
but a quarantine period is a way to find
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
out if the animal shows signs Because by
 
04:05:13.389 --> 04:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
quarantining the animal it will start to
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
show those uh aggravated signs of rabies
 
04:05:19.710 --> 04:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
over the course of um 30 days okay
 
04:05:22.830 --> 04:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yes so is that quar
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
is there a quarantine uh provision
 
04:05:28.590 --> 04:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere in law that this is connected
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
to or we have quarantines built into law
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
for importing animals when animals are
 
04:05:37.389 --> 04:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
imported to the state um we have
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
quarantines set for um dogs that have
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
traveled outside of the country when
 
04:05:44.309 --> 04:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
they come back into the us there's
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different instances um
 
04:05:48.269 --> 04:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
and probably scattered throughout our
 
04:05:51.550 --> 04:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
rsas on on when animals get quarantined
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
um but it isn't something that that uh
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be unique okay so so I guess that
 
04:05:59.469 --> 04:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
followup followup so so it's not unique
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't seem like there's
 
04:06:02.349 --> 04:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
04:06:04.990 --> 04:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
already uh in law that would cover this
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
particular instance so it seems like
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
that might need to be specified in the
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill it's possible I would ask the
 
04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
researcher for your committee to look
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
into whether you've spelled that out in
 
04:06:16.830 --> 04:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
another section of your um environment
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
and agriculture laws because I really
 
04:06:19.950 --> 04:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
don't know those very
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
well and I did depend on the on the um L
 
04:06:28.349 --> 04:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh the um s people to uh to to look into
 
04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
all of the different areas where this
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
might uh touch other laws okay thank
 
04:06:33.319 --> 04:06:35.149 align:start position:0%
might uh touch other laws okay thank
you

04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:06:40.269 --> 04:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
so in in the say some this passes and
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
somebody has a pet squirrel and that pet
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
squirrel bites somebody what would
 
04:06:51.070 --> 04:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
happen as this Law requires would that
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
that animal immediately be confiscated
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
or you'd have to have uh a permission
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
from the owner to do that well it the
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
way the law is written they would need
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
permission from the owner but in any
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
animal bite situation the owners are
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
usually very uh because of the liability
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
on the owner for if somebody does get
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
rabies this is usually very
 
04:07:12.429 --> 04:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
accommodating in a bite situation and
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
that happens with dogs as as
 
04:07:18.030 --> 04:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
well okay representative
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
you for coming to
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
testify is New Hampshire within the
 
04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
habitat of the red squirrel yes we are
 
04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why you made a
 
04:07:31.109 --> 04:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
distinction and have this only applies
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
to gray squirrels as opposed to red red
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
squirrels do not adapt to um being kept
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
as pets very well at all they are
 
04:07:38.760 --> 04:07:42.109 align:start position:0%
as pets very well at all they are
very

04:07:42.109 --> 04:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.109 --> 04:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
Bixby so
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
um I if the uh so when when you're
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
importing a animal from another state uh
 
04:08:15.389 --> 04:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
you need to have a according to um our
 
04:08:17.710 --> 04:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
RS say is you need to have a um
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
certificate Veterinary inspection is
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
that something that um is there a
 
04:08:24.670 --> 04:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
reference to that for these squirrels
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
that might be from another state or is
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
that something that might need to be
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
added it says in here
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
um that the animal um if the owner of
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
the must be up to date on any vaccines
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
required if the owner of a raccoon or
 
04:08:41.710 --> 04:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
gray squirrel cannot satisfy the
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
requirements of this paragraph Etc Etc
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so the examination and the and the
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
vaccination coming in from the state is
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
implied because of the fact that they
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
have to have those vaccines up to date
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
to keep it as a pet and if they don't
 
04:08:58.349 --> 04:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
keep it up to date um so it would have
 
04:09:00.510 --> 04:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
to be up to date when they bring it in
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
um that would otherwise it would be
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
confiscated examined it would get its
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
health certificate and its vaccinations
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
before being returned to the
 
04:09:11.309 --> 04:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
owner okay thank you so would it seemed
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
to me uh line 10 to 12 if a person
 
04:09:18.990 --> 04:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
relocates from a state where it is legal
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
to keep a raccoon or gray squirrel such
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
person can keep such raccoon or gray
 
04:09:25.710 --> 04:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
squirrel so long as such animal is up to
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
date on any vaccines required should
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
there be some sort of um
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
quarantine period since they are coming
 
04:09:35.790 --> 04:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
in from out of state just like any other
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
animals we require to have
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
quarantines I wouldn't object to that if
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
that was something the committee wanted
 
04:09:45.269 --> 04:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
to add um I would maybe stipulate that
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
if they didn't have a current and clear
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
health certificate the quarantining
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
might be needed but if they've already
 
04:09:54.109 --> 04:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
got a clear health certificate and
 
04:09:55.950 --> 04:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
record coming in from the other state
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
where they had veterinary care I I
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see the reason for that we
 
04:10:01.229 --> 04:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
don't do that with somebody's dog if
 
04:10:02.830 --> 04:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
they move here with a state and they've
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
got their upto-date medical
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
records okay thank you representative
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for taking my question um I
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
was reading yesterday about an invasion
 
04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
of gray squirrels in Europe and how
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
they're taking over from the red
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
squirrels and how it's sort of they're
 
04:10:23.149 --> 04:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
fighting back and forth and things like
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
they do fight a lot so I'm wondering my
 
04:10:29.109 --> 04:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
question is does the importation of gray
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
squirrels will that affect the
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
population of squirrels overall in New
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean it's kind of a silly
 
04:10:36.349 --> 04:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
question but I'm hearing about these
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
gray squirrels being invasive in Europe
 
04:10:41.630 --> 04:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
or the United Kingdom or whatever so I'm
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
wondering we don't have a short in the
 
04:10:45.630 --> 04:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
state of gray squirrels or red squirrels
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
and if you remember back some 5 years
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
ago at this point I think we had the
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
squirrel apocalypse where squirrel
 
04:10:54.189 --> 04:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
apocalypse yeah they were they were dead
 
04:10:56.710 --> 04:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
on every roadside everywhere you went
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
and and what happens with the life
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
cycles of the gray squirrel in New
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the red squirrel as well I
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to slight them uh they're
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
just a lot more aggressive and
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
territorial um which is why they fight
 
04:11:13.109 --> 04:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
with the gray ones the um anytime we get
 
04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
a bumper crop of acorns like we did this
 
04:11:15.239 --> 04:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
a bumper crop of acorns like we did this
last

04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
fall the next spring they're going to
 
04:11:21.630 --> 04:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
have a lot more baby squirrels and then
 
04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to start getting
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
territorial as the season starts to go
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
on because they're going to want to be
 
04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
mating and and carving out their own
 
04:11:30.510 --> 04:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
territory so you'll have them chasing
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
each other into the roads which is how
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
we ended up with that squirrel
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
apocalypse we had a giant spike in
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
population after a big Acorn year um
 
04:11:40.469 --> 04:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
they chased each other into roads and
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
and they got hit by
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
cars I don't see as uh to to complete
 
04:11:48.910 --> 04:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
that thought though I don't see people
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
bringing them in as pets contributing to
 
04:11:54.429 --> 04:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
that because one if they're kept as a
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
pet they probably cannot exist in the
 
04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
Wild on their own uh which is why
 
04:11:59.870 --> 04:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
they're being kept as a pet if they're
 
04:12:01.630 --> 04:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
from a rehabilitation facility but even
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
if they're being kept as a pet that was
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
raised somewhere else they're used to
 
04:12:06.590 --> 04:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
that human contact and that that human
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
feeding and all that other stuff they're
 
04:12:10.030 --> 04:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
not going to adapt well to being
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
suddenly released on their own uh they
 
04:12:14.109 --> 04:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
would likely be killed and eaten by a
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
hawk or or some something else a coyote
 
04:12:19.070 --> 04:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
or or what have you because they're far
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
too trusting of other animals and people
 
04:12:25.149 --> 04:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
um the and that that would probably
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
happen before they starve to death right
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
they would have a hard time finding
 
04:12:30.750 --> 04:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
their own food but they'd probably be
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
eaten by something else first um these
 
04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
are usually kept as indoor animals when
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're kept as pets they're not
 
04:12:40.590 --> 04:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
released outside like a you'd let your
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
cat out um or let your dog out you know
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
that they're they're an indoor animal
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
like a like a pet rat or Geral or a
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
guinea pig follow representative Bixby
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
oh okay followup represent wheeler and
 
04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
then Bixby just to say thank you for
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
that information and I clearly don't
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
know enough about squirrels but it's
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
also maybe an interesting allegory you
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
know the American squirrels taking over
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
the British Islands that's that's an
 
04:13:09.309 --> 04:13:09.319 align:start position:0%
interesting allegory goad represent so
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
um just a clarification on the term
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
Companion Animal and I think I know what
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
the answer to this is but I just want to
 
04:13:17.790 --> 04:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
get it out there in case people are
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
concerned um so a companion animal is
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
basically a pet yes but having that that
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
um label as of a companion animal
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you can bring it into
 
04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
any like uh any venue you want uh unlike
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
a Serv it's not like a service an animal
 
04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
where you you can you have to you can
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
have it with you in places where you
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't right that companion
 
04:13:45.469 --> 04:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
animal is from my understanding the way
 
04:13:48.429 --> 04:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
we legally refer to a pet in our
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
laws and I would just like to reiterate
 
04:13:53.550 --> 04:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
reasons we didn't pass the kangaroo Bill
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
last year was because when you have a
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
when you state that you have a companion
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
animal that also uh has bearing on if
 
04:14:10.830 --> 04:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
people have to be evacuated from
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
someplace and have to go to a Shel shter
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to bring their
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
companion animal with them and clearly a
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
kangaroo would be in an inappropriate to
 
04:14:23.070 --> 04:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
bring to some sort of shelter whereas I
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe like a raccoon or a squirrel can
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
be contained in a carrier that you can
 
04:14:29.950 --> 04:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
bring with you if you needed to go to a
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
shelter so I kind of wanted to put that
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
out there too I believe that the way we
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
structured that uh animal shelter in
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
emergency they don't they can't they
 
04:14:43.109 --> 04:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to be admitted in say say the
 
04:14:45.109 --> 04:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
hotel is made into the shelter they
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
don't need to be admitted into the hotel
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
there needs there can it can be that the
 
04:14:54.149 --> 04:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh accommodation for the animals can be
 
04:14:55.269 --> 04:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
a an
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
onsite uh like um trailer or something
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
in the parking lot yeah yeah right okay
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative Scully thank you madam
 
04:15:05.469 --> 04:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
chair do you know is there an
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
established vaccine schedule for these
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
animals in New Hampshire there's not in
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we don't allow
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
them okay so I mean I I follow
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
up you want to say something else I was
 
04:15:19.469 --> 04:15:19.479 align:start position:0%
just going to say I I believe to the
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge that the states
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
that do allow them to be kept as pets do
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
have vaccine schedules and and they take
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
them for regular vet checkups all right
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
that was kind of because the language of
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
that you have here is as so as long as
 
04:15:35.790 --> 04:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
the animal is up to date on any vaccines
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
required but in New Hampshire you're
 
04:15:39.309 --> 04:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
saying currently there are no vaccines
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
required currently there's not because
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have any allowed to be kept as
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
as pets thank you okay thank you any
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
other questions represent essentially a
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
followup on that that question so it
 
04:15:54.990 --> 04:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
probably would make sense to have in
 
04:15:56.910 --> 04:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
this bill that there should be rules
 
04:15:59.109 --> 04:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
made about vaccine schedules for these
 
04:16:01.149 --> 04:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
animals so that that will impact that's
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
a very good point that's a very good
 
04:16:04.349 --> 04:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
point and it should be done through
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
rules because it will be an off-label
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
use of a vaccine um as as done in other
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
states thank you okay thank
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for
 
04:16:20.590 --> 04:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh Spain yeah I I do have
 
04:16:24.670 --> 04:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
one other question M um regarding the
 
04:16:26.429 --> 04:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
language saying that the animal cannot
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
be confiscated do you have any
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
objections if that was written to State
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
um unless the animal bites somebody no
 
04:16:36.429 --> 04:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
objection at all okay thank you I would
 
04:16:38.830 --> 04:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
still love to see them have to give
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
permission before it's euthanized but I
 
04:16:42.510 --> 04:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
think that under a bite situation that
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
permission should be very strongly uh
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:55.269 --> 04:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
okay all right no other questions thank
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Spain for bringing
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill to committee thank you all for
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
your time I'm going to call Kurt
 
04:17:15.389 --> 04:17:15.399 align:start position:0%

uh this bill threatens public health and
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
safety and promotes the dangerous and
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
inhumane trend of keeping wild animals
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%

advises against keeping raccoons and
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%

04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
the inherent risks that come with the

private possession of wild
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
animals their wild behaviors are
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and since they are
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
potential disease vectors it makes it
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous for humans to attempt to live
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
with them as they have the potential to
 
04:18:37.109 --> 04:18:37.119 align:start position:0%
cause physical harm as well as spread

according to the New Hampshire Fish and

Game department raccoons are a major

carrier of rabies a deadly disease that
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
can be transmitted to humans and other
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%

04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
grounded in a mistaken belief that rabes

systems or who are
 
04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
pregnant this bill also presents
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
significant Animal Welfare concerns in
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
just one example it would encourage the
 
04:20:26.349 --> 04:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
improper handling of orphaned or injured
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%

04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
licensed Wildlife
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators individuals may try to
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
care for these animals on their
 
04:20:39.149 --> 04:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
own when wild animals are raised in
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
captivity they do not learn the critical
 
04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
survival skills they need to survive on
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
their own making them poor candidates
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
for safe release back into the wild
 
04:20:53.349 --> 04:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
keeping wild animals as pets is also
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
cruel to the animals
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
themselves they have complex physical
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
and social needs that cannot be met in
 
04:21:04.630 --> 04:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
captivity they are often confined to
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
small Barren cages which prevent them
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
from exhibiting natural behaviors and
 
04:21:12.910 --> 04:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
suffer from poor nutrition inade quate
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
veterinary care and mental distress when
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
they become too difficult to handle or
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
care for as they frequently
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
do owners often abandon them turning
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
them loose where they may die or
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
threaten the native
 
04:21:33.389 --> 04:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
ecosystem so I urge this committee to
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill in inexpedient to
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislate opening New Hampshire to the
 
04:21:41.790 --> 04:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
private possession of wild animals is a
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
flawed and dangerous path that threatens
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
public health and safety and would be
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
harmful to the welfare of all animals
 
04:21:53.830 --> 04:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
involved thank you for listening to me
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
today representative King thank you
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair um do you have any
 
04:22:03.469 --> 04:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
evidence um of these other states that
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
have legalized you know pet ownership of
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
these animals have you seen evidence of
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
a spike in zoonotic diseases amongst the
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
the the pets or or attacks on humans or
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
all the problems that you you uh just
 
04:22:22.109 --> 04:22:22.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned do do you see that happening
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
in the states where they've legalized I
 
04:22:26.109 --> 04:22:26.119 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have any data on that okay
 
04:22:29.550 --> 04:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so much represent Scully thank
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for coming
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
to testify um so the bill the language
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill says that these pets could
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
be adopted if they it's been determined
 
04:22:42.750 --> 04:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
that they cannot live in the wild so I
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
know this may be a difficult question to
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
ask but do you think it it' be better to
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
euthanize them than to give them chance
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
at life with somebody if they can't live
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
on their own I mean that would be on a
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Case by casee B basis by uh experts at
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
the scene or you know who are handling
 
04:22:59.840 --> 04:23:01.349 align:start position:0%
the scene or you know who are handling
that

04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:05.149 --> 04:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
case thank you represent Bix yeah um
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
just sort of following up on that um
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
the uh I think the first sentence of the
 
04:23:15.990 --> 04:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill says raccoons and gray squirrels
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
may be possessed as companion animals
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
without a permit from the Department if
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
a Wildlife Rehabilitation facility makes
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
the determination that the animal cannot
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
survive in the wild and that that such
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
animals up to date on any vaccines
 
04:23:33.000 --> 04:23:34.510 align:start position:0%
animals up to date on any vaccines
required

04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
so uh would a wild a licensed
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um Rehabilitation facility
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh be an appropriate authority to
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
determine that that the animal cannot
 
04:23:51.070 --> 04:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
survive in the wild and would therefore
 
04:23:51.080 --> 04:23:54.229 align:start position:0%
survive in the wild and would therefore
be

04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.670 --> 04:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
eligible personally I don't think I'm
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer that but there may
 
04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
be someone in the room who is uh fishing
 
04:24:03.510 --> 04:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
game is here I don't know I don't have
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
the answer to that okay thank
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
04:24:10.229 --> 04:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
I'm asking Don Bergeron from New
 
04:24:18.910 --> 04:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game to come and speak
 
04:24:18.920 --> 04:24:23.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game to come and speak
good

04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon I'm Dan burgon
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm chief of the wildlife division with
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Fish and Game department
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
I'm here um I'm here uh representing the
 
04:24:34.630 --> 04:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
commission and the department in
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill um so we have we
 
04:24:39.510 --> 04:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
have a number of concerns uh with this
 
04:24:42.990 --> 04:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
bill um to start I I think we we don't
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
believe that wild animals should be
 
04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to be kept as pets um um
 
04:24:50.750 --> 04:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
currently um we license Wildlife
 
04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators uh they give Wildlife a
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
second chance um if we find injured
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um those individuals can care
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
for those animals and release them um
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
however our current rules actually
 
04:25:05.229 --> 04:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
specify um that that if the wildlife
 
04:25:07.109 --> 04:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator or the Consulting
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
veterinarian determin that the animal
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
can't be released back into the wild
 
04:25:12.030 --> 04:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
that that the animal must be euthanized
 
04:25:14.590 --> 04:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
right now now um we do believe that is
 
04:25:16.670 --> 04:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
the best thing um to let nature take its
 
04:25:19.229 --> 04:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
course in in the instance where the wild
 
04:25:21.030 --> 04:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
where the animal cannot be released back
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
into the wild um we also have concerns
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
about some of the public health um um
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
issues that this brings up um so the
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
bill references that that a squirrel or
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
a raccoon would have to have any
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
required vaccinations currently there
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
are no statutes that we have that
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
requires vaccinations for either of
 
04:25:43.229 --> 04:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
these animals um and one of the main
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
reasons for that is because there are no
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
approved vaccines for these animals
 
04:25:49.870 --> 04:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
because they are wild animals um any
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination given to them would be
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
considered off Lael use um and
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
and the the effectiveness is not proven
 
04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
and I think there would be I think you
 
04:26:05.950 --> 04:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
would o open up a a lot of liability um
 
04:26:07.710 --> 04:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
hanging your hanging your hat on
 
04:26:09.630 --> 04:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for an animal that are not
 
04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
approved for that for that animal um
 
04:26:15.830 --> 04:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
there as was mentioned before there are
 
04:26:17.710 --> 04:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
other diseases that that these animals
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
can carry raccoon roundworm was one K9
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
distemper is another one that raccoons
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
can get um these are things that can be
 
04:26:26.830 --> 04:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
passed to pet dogs as well and again
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
there are no approved vaccines for these
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
animals and there are no current
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
statutes that require them and I don't
 
04:26:35.109 --> 04:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
see anything in this bill that would
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
require these vaccinations either they
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
reference required vaccines but there's
 
04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
nowhere in any law that that that
 
04:26:43.510 --> 04:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
requires anything
 
04:26:46.590 --> 04:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
um the other the other concern is that
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
it it I know there was some talk about
 
04:26:50.670 --> 04:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
possible amendments but in its current
 
04:26:53.670 --> 04:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
form um if someone were to be bitten
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
this not only prevents the agency from
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
being able to confiscate it um but also
 
04:27:01.389 --> 04:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
EU euthanize it and there was some there
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
was some um conversation about a
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
quarantine but I don't see anything in
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
here that would allow the department to
 
04:27:09.870 --> 04:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
do that under the current language um
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
because it very very plainly says
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
um um the raccoon or graay squirrel
 
04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
shall not be confiscated or euthanized
 
04:27:20.950 --> 04:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
without the permission of the owner and
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
while I would hope that most people
 
04:27:24.510 --> 04:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
would be willing to do that I I would
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
not want to hang my hat on that for
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
something that's for for disease as
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
deadly as rabies um rabies is 100% fatal
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
when someone develops the symptoms um so
 
04:27:37.590 --> 04:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's not something that that we've
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
ever been willing to take chances on um
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
so I I feel like this would tie our
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
hands um from being able to act
 
04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately um in the event that
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
someone was bitten and again um even
 
04:27:51.950 --> 04:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
with the vaccination those those are not
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
um approved for these animals um um and
 
04:27:56.349 --> 04:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
there and there are no legal
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
requirements um so we have a lot of
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about this um again um the way
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
that our rehabilit Rehabilitation system
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
works um we license individuals there's
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
certain requirements that they have to
 
04:28:09.990 --> 04:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
go through they have to work under uh
 
04:28:12.510 --> 04:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
the consultation of a veterinarian
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
um even Wildlife rehabilitators are not
 
04:28:17.389 --> 04:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to keep these animals if they
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
cannot release them into the wild um
 
04:28:21.429 --> 04:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
those animals must be euthanized the
 
04:28:23.349 --> 04:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
only instance where you can keep one of
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
these is under an exhibitor's permit um
 
04:28:28.510 --> 04:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
so think like Squam Lake Science Center
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
um where you have where you have some of
 
04:28:32.469 --> 04:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
these animals for educational purposes
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
um but even a rehabilitator would not be
 
04:28:36.510 --> 04:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to keep one of these animals
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
unless they got an exhibitor's permit um
 
04:28:41.429 --> 04:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
and then um and then had some sort of
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
educational program that they use the
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
animal for um so um So currently there's
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
and and I did reach out to my
 
04:28:52.469 --> 04:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
counterparts in surrounding states um
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
when I saw this bill come out so I
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
reached out to Maine Massachusetts and
 
04:28:59.870 --> 04:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont um I'm not I'm not sure what the
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
ma the map was that was presented um
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
they all indicated to me that none of
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
these animals can be owned as pets some
 
04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
do have an exhibitor's permit similar to
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does um but again those
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
are under very um specific circumstances
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
to individuals typically that have some
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
sort of educational purpose like Squam
 
04:29:19.510 --> 04:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
Lake Science Center not not for someone
 
04:29:22.830 --> 04:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
to own as a as a pet um so those are
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that we have and
 
04:29:26.109 --> 04:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for testifying today um
 
04:29:33.109 --> 04:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
not a rhetorical question honest
 
04:29:36.269 --> 04:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
question how do you define what is a
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
wild animal is that clearly defined in
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
statute is that somewhere in code or we
 
04:29:42.990 --> 04:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
looking at a diction Ary definition
 
04:29:45.630 --> 04:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
because when I think of like snakes and
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
rats and birds I think of those as wild
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
animals and yet people are legally
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to own those so how do you
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
define what is and is not a wild animal
 
04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
and why do seemingly some wild animals
 
04:30:01.149 --> 04:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
have a green green card and others not
 
04:30:03.109 --> 04:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
um so there is a definition of wildlife
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
in our rules um when I when I reference
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
Wildlife I'm I'm referencing native
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
actual wild animals um so there's
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's likely areas of the country
 
04:30:16.229 --> 04:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
where um there's um you know there's
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
raccoons that have been domesticated and
 
04:30:22.349 --> 04:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
bred um you know that it gets a little
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
bit um it gets a little bit tricky still
 
04:30:27.790 --> 04:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
but but you know those are maybe not a
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
wild animal um um so when when I'm when
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're talk I mean this build seems to
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
reference animals taken from the wild in
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so that's kind of where
 
04:30:39.910 --> 04:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
where we make that distinction these
 
04:30:41.550 --> 04:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
animals are coming from the wild they
 
04:30:43.750 --> 04:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
weren't um they weren't bred over
 
04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
generations and domesticated okay follow
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
up follow up so um so like snakes are
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
those generally bred in captivity on and
 
04:30:55.710 --> 04:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
on or or I know rats are rats I think
 
04:30:57.550 --> 04:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
are often always bred in captivity
 
04:30:59.109 --> 04:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
you're not just grabbing Rats from the
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
wild but what about snakes and and as
 
04:31:03.469 --> 04:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
well yeah it depends on the species
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
really and there are there are wild
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
species of rat so Norway rat we have
 
04:31:09.429 --> 04:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire those that's a wild
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
species of rat we have um numerous
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
native Snake species in the state of New
 
04:31:16.349 --> 04:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so there are various
 
04:31:18.030 --> 04:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
species like that that are bred in
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
captivity um but but we have numerous
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
Wild Ones as well e Even Rats okay thank
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Bixby yeah so uh
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
just to to get a little bit more
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
clarification on how uh so the the bill
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
suggests that somehow if a if an animal
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
has been rehabilitated a wild animal has
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
been rehab
 
04:31:44.910 --> 04:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
debilitated uh and but can't be released
 
04:31:47.070 --> 04:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
into the wild that somehow that would
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
qualify it uh as you for being um viable
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
as being a pet but uh in terms of the
 
04:31:54.880 --> 04:31:56.030 align:start position:0%
as being a pet but uh in terms of the
animal

04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
animal
 
04:31:59.830 --> 04:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
behavior uh would that with the its wild
 
04:32:02.349 --> 04:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
essentially having been wild from you
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
know birth to the time it was injured
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
would that
 
04:32:09.389 --> 04:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
essentially uh make its
 
04:32:13.630 --> 04:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
Behavior Uh unsuitable for household
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
had it it certainly could so
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
typically I guess I'll I'll I'll put it
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
this way so typically when a when a when
 
04:32:24.790 --> 04:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
a wild animal is not not able to be
 
04:32:26.590 --> 04:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
released back into the wild it's it's
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
usually because it has some sort of
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
severe injury um and in many cases those
 
04:32:34.630 --> 04:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
injuries um may be life-threatening um
 
04:32:38.349 --> 04:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
but in in a lot of others um it would
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
not be a good candidate for a pet
 
04:32:43.149 --> 04:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
because they would likely require
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
substantial Specialized Care right um
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise if the animal was able to be
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated back to back to its full
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
function and released into the wild
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's what rehabilitators are
 
04:32:55.710 --> 04:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to and required in our rules to
 
04:32:58.189 --> 04:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
do um so I would have concerns that you
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
might end up with with animals that have
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
um that are in need of Specialized Care
 
04:33:06.029 --> 04:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
that those would most likely be the ones
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
that because they're not candidates for
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
release back into the wild that they
 
04:33:12.029 --> 04:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
would have some some pretty substantial
 
04:33:16.670 --> 04:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
issues um again whether the other issue
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
the other issue I see is um there's
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that specifies what sort
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
of documentation a person would need it
 
04:33:26.590 --> 04:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
just says that a rehabilitation facility
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
determines that it's not um not fit for
 
04:33:32.590 --> 04:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
release um but there's you know from
 
04:33:35.470 --> 04:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
from our Department's perspective um if
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of people with
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
squirrels we still need to know somehow
 
04:33:42.029 --> 04:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
um even though there's not a perit
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
required we still need to know that that
 
04:33:46.349 --> 04:33:46.359 align:start position:0%
person um got the okay from a rehabber I
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
suppose but but there's no there's no
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
forms there's you know is it is it
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
simply they said yeah this this is good
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
to go or did they have to sign some sort
 
04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
of paperwork so that's not clear how
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
that would how that would function and
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
how our department would deal with that
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
either followup so um so one so there's
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
I I see a couple of directions this bill
 
04:34:15.629 --> 04:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
could go one is that um we could uh do a
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
lot of work on it and put together a
 
04:34:22.349 --> 04:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
permit structure for someone to accept
 
04:34:25.949 --> 04:34:25.959 align:start position:0%
uh a rehabilitated animal from the wild
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
and uh have that as a legally um
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
permitted Companion Animal and put
 
04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
together some sort of schedule of how
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
vaccines for various things should
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
happen in rules uh or we could say that
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
if an animal that was found injured in
 
04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
the wild is not able to be re
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated back to a level of where
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
Health where it can go into the wild it
 
04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
would have died anyway and it's just a
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
dead animal uh which approach do you
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
think would be more
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
advisable I think I think the ladder is
 
04:35:07.230 --> 04:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
more advisable um again we license
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators to give some of these
 
04:35:11.789 --> 04:35:11.799 align:start position:0%
injured animals a second chance um but
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
but again um I I think I think you run
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
into Dangerous Ground when you start
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
allowing people to keep wild animals as
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
pets and and I guess another concern is
 
04:35:23.429 --> 04:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
kind of where does it end right so we're
 
04:35:27.429 --> 04:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
doing squirrels and raccoons today um we
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
um we run into issues with people who've
 
04:35:33.310 --> 04:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
illegally taken in fawns um and um we'll
 
04:35:35.070 --> 04:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
find those animals that have been kind
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
of kicked out um as they get older and
 
04:35:40.269 --> 04:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
and or everyone loves to post things on
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
Facebook so we'll find out that way um I
 
04:35:44.429 --> 04:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
I will
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
say um we we do try so so as an example
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
um a few years ago there was an instance
 
04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
where there was a deer that someone had
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
clearly kept as a pet um that deer was
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
showing up in people's backyards and
 
04:36:02.070 --> 04:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
taking handouts and and um it was so
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
tame that someone actually walked it
 
04:36:07.470 --> 04:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
into a dog kennel um we we worked our
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
hardest to find a place to put that deer
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
so that we didn't have to euthanize it
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
now you can't always find a place for an
 
04:36:15.869 --> 04:36:15.879 align:start position:0%
animal but we do work with um with other
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
other exhibitors so for example that
 
04:36:19.990 --> 04:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
deer is now at Squam Lake Science Center
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
so um there's there's not there's not
 
04:36:26.269 --> 04:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
it's not that there's never another
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
Avenue um but these these also happen
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
very infrequently and and you know the
 
04:36:32.189 --> 04:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
other thing I'll point out about the
 
04:36:34.029 --> 04:36:34.039 align:start position:0%
case in New York is that individual had
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
both of those animals illegally um that
 
04:36:39.189 --> 04:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
was not an instance where he got he got
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
animals that were unfit for release he
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
he just had those animals illegally um
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
had those been brought to a
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator they likely would have
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
been been able to be released back into
 
04:36:48.959 --> 04:36:50.189 align:start position:0%
been been able to be released back into
the

04:36:50.189 --> 04:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
wild thank you so um I have a question
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Scully please take your
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
seat um I have a question regarding
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
um people who have these animals as pets
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
who don't live in New Hampshire and
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
perhaps are looking to move to New
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should they be able to bring
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
their pets with
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
them um
 
04:37:16.150 --> 04:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
if I would say no if they're if if they
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
if they fall under these categories I
 
04:37:19.310 --> 04:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:37:22.670 --> 04:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
no so if they've
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
successfully had these animals that
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
they've had as pets and they are
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
essentially domesticated and used to
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
being around
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
people they should not be able to bring
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
those animals with them when they move
 
04:37:38.590 --> 04:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
here again we still have concerns about
 
04:37:40.590 --> 04:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
the human health and safety uh issues
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
with this because there are no approved
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines for these
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
animals okay
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
um so in also you can can you I'll ask
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
the same question I asked of
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
Representative Spain um how much does it
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
normally cost for the state fish and
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
game department to rehabilitate um a
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
squirrel or a raccoon I mean depending
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
on whatever injury or whatever the
 
04:38:10.750 --> 04:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances I I get that but just sort
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
you know sort of ballpark how long would
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
it take many weeks of intensive care or
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
whatever so the cost for re the the
 
04:38:24.109 --> 04:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
department does not spend any money on
 
04:38:26.269 --> 04:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation we license uh
 
04:38:28.750 --> 04:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators and they um they
 
04:38:30.109 --> 04:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
typically work they'll they'll have
 
04:38:32.109 --> 04:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
grants and donations and things like
 
04:38:34.629 --> 04:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
that um again the the length of time it
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
takes to rehabilitate a specific animal
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
is going to vary depending on the the
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
injuries that it has um obviously the
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
the you know the more the injury the
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
longer it's going to take but um the
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
department does not spend any money on
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation other than occasionally
 
04:38:50.910 --> 04:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
going out to relay an animal to a
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator um typically smaller
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
animals like squirrels um often times
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
are brought to rehabilitators by the
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
public themselves um it's usually larger
 
04:39:02.109 --> 04:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
animals that that the department staff
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
will relay so things like um moose cabs
 
04:39:07.709 --> 04:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
deer fawns spare Cubs those things will
 
04:39:10.590 --> 04:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
transport to a rehabilitator um there's
 
04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
often um is you know specialized
 
04:39:14.789 --> 04:39:14.799 align:start position:0%
training that's required to be able to
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
handle those animals but the public by
 
04:39:20.189 --> 04:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
and large takes smaller animals um to to
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator so the cost to the
 
04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
department is is virtually nothing okay
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
and so um my last question
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
is so say fishing game where somebody
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
turns into fishing game um a a squirrel
 
04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
that has been hit by a car has damaged
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
to its leg okay and um they're able
 
04:39:46.470 --> 04:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
to bring them to you or whoever is
 
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating this animal
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
and they
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
can somewhat repair the damage but the
 
04:39:58.110 --> 04:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
squirrel is not really
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
um uh you know fully functional with
 
04:40:02.080 --> 04:40:03.190 align:start position:0%
um uh you know fully functional with
that

04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
leg so the end to that would be just
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't want to re release it
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
it's healthy it's fine
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
but you wouldn't want to release it back
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
into the wild because it would be
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
immediate prey for somebody else um
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
some um Predator so that animal would
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
then be
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
euthanized um it would end up being the
 
04:40:29.868 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
determination of the rehabber and the
 
04:40:31.948 --> 04:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
Consulting vet that they work with um
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should be euthanized
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
but if if they felt it couldn't be
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
released back into the wild that that
 
04:40:37.868 --> 04:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
would be the determination that they
 
04:40:39.550 --> 04:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
would end up making if they didn't think
 
04:40:41.590 --> 04:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
it could survive in the wild okay thank
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative H
 
04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question presumably
 
04:40:48.560 --> 04:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question presumably
the

04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
um professionals at the rehab places
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
will make that determination before they
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead and invest a lot of time and
 
04:41:03.788 --> 04:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
energy in an animal that's likely to not
 
04:41:05.868 --> 04:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
be able to be released and therefore
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be euthanized is that not the
 
04:41:10.350 --> 04:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
case yeah that would be the case and um
 
04:41:12.670 --> 04:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
so for example deer fawns with broken
 
04:41:15.070 --> 04:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
legs are almost immediately euthanized
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
because um it's understood that that
 
04:41:18.990 --> 04:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
animal likely is not going to be able to
 
04:41:21.470 --> 04:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
be um now it's not always the case it
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
depends on the type of break and and the
 
04:41:25.550 --> 04:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
ability of the vet to do something but
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
but that is true uh rehabilitators are
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
very good at assessing um injuries and
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
and and the potential for rehabilitation
 
04:41:34.990 --> 04:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
so often times those decisions are made
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
relatively early on they're they're not
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to sink a lot of their because um
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
I so um we we work closely there's not a
 
04:41:45.990 --> 04:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
lot of rehabilitators in the state um
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
there are a handful that do the bulk of
 
04:41:49.470 --> 04:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
the work and we work very closely with
 
04:41:52.590 --> 04:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
them um very dedicated people um they do
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
not make these decisions lightly um but
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
but they do really good work and and
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I've spoken to some of them and I I I
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
believe that they feel similar as as the
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
department does on this at least the
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
ones that I've spoken to thank
 
04:42:12.910 --> 04:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
you okay and no other questions uh thank
 
04:42:14.510 --> 04:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate your time thank you
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
very much and I'd like to call
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
nder thank you madam chair good
 
04:42:26.670 --> 04:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon committee members um I asked
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor this bill because I saw
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
the story about what happened in New
 
04:42:36.030 --> 04:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
York and in 2011 I was the sponsor of a
 
04:42:39.550 --> 04:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
bill to legalize ownership of Quaker
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
parrots so I don't need to tell you the
 
04:42:42.910 --> 04:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
story because you could go to the gift
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
shop and buy a book about that um Kevin
 
04:42:47.788 --> 04:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
avard who's a senator now was a freshman
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
legislator with me and he wrote the
 
04:42:51.550 --> 04:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
story about legalizing the Quaker
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
parrots now at the time you were there
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
Kevin Kevin skull you may have even been
 
04:42:56.320 --> 04:42:56.910 align:start position:0%
Kevin Kevin skull you may have even been
a

04:42:56.910 --> 04:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um Fish and Game testified
 
04:43:01.150 --> 04:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
against that bill but I think they were
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
secretly on my side because they love
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
animals now listening uh to the
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
testimony today so many things came to
 
04:43:12.510 --> 04:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
mind um a movie a book I read called the
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
zookeeper's wife and she had all kinds
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
of of interesting pets an armadillo a
 
04:43:21.150 --> 04:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
badger maybe a squirrel I'm not really
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
sure uh the snow the squirrel apocalypse
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
I do remember that because it was a
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
bumpy ride anywhere we went that year
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I thought it I thought it was an
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
omen and it turns out maybe it was
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
because Co
 
04:43:37.750 --> 04:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
followed um's see I I you had mentioned
 
04:43:39.948 --> 04:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating animals I actually had a
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
friend who who did that she was a a
 
04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
stunt woman in movies and one of the
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
little animals that the police brought
 
04:43:48.510 --> 04:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
her to take care of was a baby skunk
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
baby skunk was in the car with her doing
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
a stunt in a movie and was able to be in
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
the credits so the baby skunk was in the
 
04:43:57.788 --> 04:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
credits she would uh bring she brought a
 
04:44:00.350 --> 04:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
baby squirrel to to gym class we do a
 
04:44:02.670 --> 04:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
weightlifting class together and I I
 
04:44:04.590 --> 04:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
remember that little animal and I didn't
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm like wow you can you have a pet
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
squirrel the police brought it to her
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
because they knew that she cared for
 
04:44:11.550 --> 04:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
animals and that little squirrel
 
04:44:14.590 --> 04:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't even open its eyes um but it
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
turned its head because we were all
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
fussing over it like it was a baby it
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
turned its head towards her even though
 
04:44:21.628 --> 04:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
I couldn't see I'm like oh my gosh he
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
thinks you're it's you're his mother or
 
04:44:28.110 --> 04:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
she um so oh and the ferrets you also
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the ferrets at the time when
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
we were discussing legalizing quaker
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
parrots did hear from others about the
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
ferrets and how they were taken and
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
euthanized before they were legalized
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
and they had all kinds of concerns
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about those as well um I never
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
thought about the rabies but um I think
 
04:44:48.670 --> 04:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
that was everything I had on my notes um
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
I do support the bill representative

Game had um do you feel like this bill
 
04:45:04.510 --> 04:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
could use some amendments to clarify

have a page saying why raccoons should
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
not be pets and this is a couple of

we will have a raccoon that cannot be

they need large open spaces and then to

talk about squirrels this is someone who
 
04:48:08.548 --> 04:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh used to own squirrels razor sharp

ability to get anywhere they feel like
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%

value your home furnishings and or your

don't understand how they can Flay you
 
04:48:28.030 --> 04:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
when leaping off or playing and then
 
04:48:30.990 --> 04:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
there is a veterinarian uh page and they
 
04:48:33.548 --> 04:48:33.558 align:start position:0%
are address uh squirrels in particular
 
04:48:35.430 --> 04:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
so these are veterinarian saying these
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
words the squirrel owns you if you want
 
04:48:39.788 --> 04:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
to go away you will need to find a house
 
04:48:42.030 --> 04:48:42.040 align:start position:0%

not possess the bite inhibition reflex
 
04:48:56.470 --> 04:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
of domestic pets if the first thing that
 
04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
crosses their brain is to bite there is
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
no counter message to say this is a bad
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
plan and given all of these things so
 
04:49:05.670 --> 04:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
now if people own these racons where
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
they have them as pets and they take on
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
something that that is a little over the
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
top and they didn't realize what they
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
were doing my fear is that they can't
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
handle these animals they will put that
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
animal in their car they will drive
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the middle of nowhere and
 
04:49:20.350 --> 04:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
they will dump them people dump wild
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
animals all the time to relocate them
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
off their property that is against the
 
04:49:27.390 --> 04:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
law and then also this is this could
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
possibly even happen if that CH if that
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
raccoon or squirrel scratches their
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
child and they get really mad they could
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
just take that raccoon or squirrel
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
outside and shoot them who's to know and
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
then uh I don't think that this animal
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
is in the this bill is in the animal's
 
04:49:45.750 --> 04:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
best interest and I want to say too is
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we already have domestic animals we
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
have dogs and cats and currently right
 
04:49:51.150 --> 04:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
now there are hundreds of them
 
04:49:53.190 --> 04:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
languishing in shelters across the state
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and now we want to add
 
04:49:57.788 --> 04:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
more pets to the mix and I will say when
 
04:50:00.510 --> 04:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about rabies with cats
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
they're not registered like dogs some
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
people own cats and never get their
 
04:50:07.548 --> 04:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
shots they never have rabies shots so I
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
have a of a big uh worry about who's
 
04:50:13.948 --> 04:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
going to police these raccoons and these
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
squirrels to make sure that they get
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
their shots so uh just in closing I I I
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
hope that you oppose this bill I think
 
04:50:23.070 --> 04:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
there's way too many concerns and it is
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the animals
 
04:50:25.440 --> 04:50:26.670 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the animals
thank

04:50:26.670 --> 04:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:50:29.670 --> 04:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
you okay um so I have a
 
04:50:33.628 --> 04:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
question um you cited some testimony
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
from people outside of New Hampshire who
 
04:50:36.400 --> 04:50:38.070 align:start position:0%
from people outside of New Hampshire who
own

04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:50:41.310 --> 04:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
raccoons um
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
how do you think that they would feel if
 
04:50:45.230 --> 04:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
their state banned them from having
 
04:50:46.948 --> 04:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
those pets I mean obviously they keep
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
them as pets they like them as
 
04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
pets yeah I'm sure that they love their
 
04:50:53.310 --> 04:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
raccoons because uh but they're just
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
kind of warning the public about this is
 
04:50:57.390 --> 04:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
what you're going to get into and what I
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
would hope would happen and I you know I
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
don't have any expert or legal expertise
 
04:51:03.390 --> 04:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
but I would hope that there would be
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
loopholes in grandfather in once because
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's in my experience that's usually
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
what happens when a new gets past um
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's grandfathered clause for people
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
that already own those animals and then
 
04:51:18.190 --> 04:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
that would prevent them from owning them
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
again once those animals
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
pass any other questions representative
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh King thank you madam chair I'm sorry
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
maybe you uh mentioned it and I missed
 
04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
it but did you make a distinction really
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
between squirrels and raccoons because I
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
remember you talking a lot about
 
04:51:36.750 --> 04:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
raccoons and it's not Humane to own them
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
and stuff but squirrels they seem like a
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
different you know I mean they a
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
different Beast altogether but they seem
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
like they're quite domesticable what are
 
04:51:47.230 --> 04:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that yeah I I did maybe
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm a little nervous but maybe
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
the first half was about uh raccoon and
 
04:51:53.548 --> 04:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
then it delved into squirrels and the
 
04:51:55.830 --> 04:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
squirrels are the ones where o sorry it
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
says razor sharp claws razor sharp teeth
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
High Intelligence High curiosity and
 
04:52:02.670 --> 04:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
abil ability to get anywhere and it says
 
04:52:04.750 --> 04:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
they have sharp squirrel Nails sharp
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
teeth there is uh just as an example
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
there are several groups of these states
 
04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
that do own squirrels and there there's
 
04:52:13.948 --> 04:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
some social media groups and even these
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
people who have owned squirrels in these
 
04:52:17.708 --> 04:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
states they point up their finger and
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
say oh the squirrel got me today as the
 
04:52:22.110 --> 04:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
finger is dripping with blood they have
 
04:52:24.150 --> 04:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
sharp teeth they can chew through
 
04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
Hickory nuts so that's dangerous and I
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
worry about children and and other
 
04:52:30.600 --> 04:52:32.110 align:start position:0%
worry about children and and other
pets

04:52:32.110 --> 04:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
pets
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
so okay I was follow up I will just
 
04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
really more thinking about the the
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
humanity of a squirrel being you know
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
cuz it sounds like raccoons really don't
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
want to be domesticated they need 3
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
miles like you said a r radius of range
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
but it seems like squirrels yeah they
 
04:52:51.548 --> 04:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
bite but so do other animals um but are
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
they Miserable as as pets and it seems
 
04:52:57.750 --> 04:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
to me at least through my very limited
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge that squirrels actually are
 
04:53:02.430 --> 04:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
fairly happy as as pets did you did you
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
mention that or your thoughts on that I
 
04:53:05.590 --> 04:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
think it it depends you know there was
 
04:53:07.868 --> 04:53:07.878 align:start position:0%
actually and this might cause you to
 
04:53:09.670 --> 04:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
laugh but there was actually scientific
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
proof that that's squirrels have
 
04:53:12.750 --> 04:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
distinct personality so I think it
 
04:53:14.270 --> 04:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
depends on the squirrel there's actually
 
04:53:16.230 --> 04:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
more here where it says from what I've
 
04:53:18.110 --> 04:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
heard some squirrels take to
 
04:53:20.230 --> 04:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
domestication and will hang out with you
 
04:53:22.350 --> 04:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
all their life While others hit puberty
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
and want nothing more to do with you
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
than to go to the wild if you get a pup
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
and invest perhaps they will but there's
 
04:53:28.798 --> 04:53:29.830 align:start position:0%
and invest perhaps they will but there's
no

04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:53:33.070 --> 04:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
guarantees thank you any other questions
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:53:37.548 --> 04:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee represent Scully hi thank you
 
04:53:39.390 --> 04:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know the answer to
 
04:53:42.628 --> 04:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
this or not but can squirrels be like
 
04:53:44.430 --> 04:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
house broken like cats and trained to
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
use litter box or I I do not think
 
04:53:49.150 --> 04:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
squirrels do from what I've seen on
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
these social media groups they usually
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
have a habitat setup in their home or
 
04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
maybe outside kind of similar to ever
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
seen those out outdoor enclosures for
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
cats and they'll you know they keep them
 
04:54:02.510 --> 04:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
in there and then newspaper and things
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
like that and as far as raccoons they
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
may be trained to use a litter box but I
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
do not know for sure all right thank you
 
04:54:12.830 --> 04:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions thank you for
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:22.270 --> 04:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
O'Brien it's our last pink card if
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else wishes to speak on
 
04:54:28.990 --> 04:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
this okay thank you good afternoon
 
04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
welcome to environment and agriculture
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Joan O'Brien from
 
04:54:36.750 --> 04:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
Amhurst and uh I opposeed the bill I
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
think we all felt really terrible when
 
04:54:40.990 --> 04:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
peanut you know the squir and Fred the
 
04:54:43.390 --> 04:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
raccoon got confiscated and killed and
 
04:54:45.390 --> 04:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
it was actually as an animal Advocate I
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
was heartened to see how many people in
 
04:54:49.150 --> 04:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
this country were really outraged by
 
04:54:50.590 --> 04:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
that because it shows how much we care
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
about animals so that was wonderful um I
 
04:54:56.110 --> 04:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
believe you know wild animals belong in
 
04:54:58.548 --> 04:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
the wild that's been said we don't want
 
04:55:00.910 --> 04:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
to do anything that would encourage more
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
people from taking wild animals and
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
bringing them into their
 
04:55:05.040 --> 04:55:07.070 align:start position:0%
bringing them into their
homes

04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
um representative King was asking about
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between between wild and
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
domestic lots of things have made that
 
04:55:17.708 --> 04:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
crossover if they enter the pet trade
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um room for Animal
 
04:55:22.310 --> 04:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
Welfare issues because you get that
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
profit motive involved and then you've
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
got people selling snakes selling
 
04:55:28.030 --> 04:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
ferrets and people that aren't doing a
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
very good job of taking care of the
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
animals so in general we just we want
 
04:55:34.830 --> 04:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
more wild animals wild and fewer
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
domesticated so with peanut and Fred it
 
04:55:42.270 --> 04:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the his Guardian had I
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
read he had tried to release the
 
04:55:46.270 --> 04:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
squirrel and the squirrel came back to
 
04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
his house and i' had read he was in the
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
process of of trying to obtain a permit
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
when they were
 
04:55:55.510 --> 04:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
confiscated so I don't know how things
 
04:55:57.390 --> 04:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
work in New York but I mean we do have a
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
process that Dan berson explained about
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
getting a permit so that you can be an
 
04:56:05.548 --> 04:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
exhibitor of the squirrel and these
 
04:56:07.548 --> 04:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
peanut and Fred seem to be sort of you
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
know educational animals so that would
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
have made sense to be an exhibitor they
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
were on
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
YouTube um it's some hoops you have to
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
jump through but I think that's
 
04:56:18.990 --> 04:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate if you're motivated you
 
04:56:20.548 --> 04:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
probably could have kept those animals
 
04:56:22.470 --> 04:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
with a permit to be an exhibitor if he
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
had done the right things this guy in
 
04:56:26.590 --> 04:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
New York there's somebody in um New
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's got a skunk just one skunk
 
04:56:30.910 --> 04:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
he's an exhibitor maybe it was the same
 
04:56:33.430 --> 04:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
situation a skunk that he rescued and
 
04:56:33.440 --> 04:56:34.510 align:start position:0%
situation a skunk that he rescued and
couldn't

04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
04:56:37.390 --> 04:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
release um I know down in Massachusetts
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
there was a rehab or she had a I think
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
it was a porcupine that she didn't think
 
04:56:43.628 --> 04:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
could be released so he's living there
 
04:56:46.030 --> 04:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
forever um but there was she was
 
04:56:47.948 --> 04:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
challenged you know that she was asked
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
to release him but she was able to prove
 
04:56:51.510 --> 04:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
that he couldn't survive on his own he's
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
going to live out his life with the
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
rehabber that's an option if people have
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
the space and then just lastly I'll say
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
um rep wheer brought up the gray
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
squirrels in the UK um did you know that
 
04:57:07.868 --> 04:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
Japan's overrun with raccoons because of
 
04:57:10.590 --> 04:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
a book called Rascal it came out in the
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
60s and then it became a movie and then
 
04:57:15.628 --> 04:57:15.638 align:start position:0%
it became a series a cartoon series in
 
04:57:18.070 --> 04:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
Japan and even though the whole theme of
 
04:57:20.910 --> 04:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
the series was what a rascal he was and
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
how he wasn't a good pet it it sparked a
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
whole like craze of everybody wanting a
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
raccoon so now Japan is overwhel with
 
04:57:32.310 --> 04:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
raccoons and uh so you know morals right
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
that's a lesson to be learned thank you
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%

want to clarify I I am introducing this
 
05:03:26.708 --> 05:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
bill I am a co- sponsor but I am simply
 
05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill I am not
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
testifying and when you are done
 
05:03:31.150 --> 05:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill you may take your
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
seat so um this is relative to
 
05:03:35.548 --> 05:03:35.558 align:start position:0%
applications to the cost of care fund
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
for livestock care and the bill
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
essentially puts further restrictions on
 
05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
how uh applications will be uh assessed
 
05:03:50.110 --> 05:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you appreciate you bringing
 
05:03:50.120 --> 05:03:53.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank you appreciate you bringing
that

05:03:53.070 --> 05:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.788 --> 05:03:57.798 align:start position:0%
forward I now call um commissioner Sean
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
263 thank you madam chair chman members
 
05:04:11.390 --> 05:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I am
 
05:04:12.788 --> 05:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
Shan Jasper commissioner of the
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
food I am here to testify against the
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
written um so you
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
would have to read this bill in the
 
05:04:31.390 --> 05:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
context of chapter
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
644 which is where the seizure of
 
05:04:38.670 --> 05:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
animals can take place I know that um
 
05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
House Bill six 16 is coming along and
 
05:04:43.708 --> 05:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
frankly I would suggest that if you feel
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's a need for um
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
263 then you should probably incorporate
 
05:04:54.548 --> 05:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
it into the bill so that we don't end up
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
with uh a conflict because if the loss
 
05:05:02.110 --> 05:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
stays as it is there would be a a fairly
 
05:05:05.470 --> 05:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
dramatic uh conflict and that is under
 
05:05:07.868 --> 05:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
current law in chapter
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
644 there is no requirement that there
 
05:05:11.948 --> 05:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
be a
 
05:05:15.150 --> 05:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
consultation with anyone who has
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
experience in the care of um the type of
 
05:05:21.270 --> 05:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
animals that is being seized so what
 
05:05:24.350 --> 05:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
would happen is the law enforcement
 
05:05:27.548 --> 05:05:27.558 align:start position:0%
agency would lawfully seize the animals
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
under the current law and then apply to
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
me for care and I would have to deny
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
that if they weren't aware that prior to
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
applying and prior to to seizing the
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
animals they needed to bring somebody in
 
05:05:46.270 --> 05:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's very
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
confusing uh and really isn't the way we
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
should should be moving forward the
 
05:05:53.470 --> 05:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
other problem and the bigger problem for
 
05:05:56.510 --> 05:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
me is there is no way a Commissioner of
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
Agriculture should be put in the
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
position of deciding whether a law
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency acted
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
lawfully that's just way beyond my
 
05:06:10.270 --> 05:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
capability that's what the courts of for
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
I have consulted with the Attorney
 
05:06:14.190 --> 05:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
General's office on this and they agree
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
with me that I should not be put in this
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
this position uh and that this is a
 
05:06:24.430 --> 05:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
matter for the courts so in in essence
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
um I would ask you to to kill the bill
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
and if you see any need for this type of
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
of thing to be done just do it when you
 
05:06:35.830 --> 05:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
do uh
 
05:06:38.030 --> 05:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
616 and I'd be glad to answer any
 
05:06:38.040 --> 05:06:40.708 align:start position:0%
616 and I'd be glad to answer any
questions

05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah no um I remember when um we
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
were drafting up hb6 2016 and I don't
 
05:06:51.070 --> 05:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
like to really refer to other bills
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
especially haven't they haven't been
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
heard yet in our committee um but when
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
we were putting together that
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
legislation I know that there was a
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
piece uh having to do with the cost of
 
05:07:05.070 --> 05:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
care fund and it was suggested that we
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
tease that out and do it
 
05:07:10.590 --> 05:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
separately uh as we did with with the F
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
and Colt Bill and
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
um I guess there was the law enforcement
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
training piece also there was a number
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
of different things and we didn't want
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
to kind of jam everything on into one
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation so that's kind of
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
how this came about that um this this
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill was a separate entity um
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
so I I can I can actually appreciate you
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
know wanting to at least keep this piece
 
05:07:46.708 --> 05:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
in with the other bill um and and make
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
it sort of like a kind of clarifies why
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make whatever change to that
 
05:07:57.110 --> 05:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
um Co to the cost of care fund so would
 
05:07:57.120 --> 05:07:58.270 align:start position:0%
um Co to the cost of care fund so would
you

05:07:58.270 --> 05:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:08:01.430 --> 05:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
agree um though
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
that certain language then maybe not
 
05:08:08.430 --> 05:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
this particular language but other
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
language having to do with the
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
application of cost of care fund um then
 
05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
be addressed in in some other way I I
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
would and my my recollection of the
 
05:08:22.510 --> 05:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
those discussions were that what we were
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
talking about in the cost of care fund
 
05:08:27.070 --> 05:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
were totally different than what I'm
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
seeing here and that what we had talked
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
about didn't create a conflict uh and
 
05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
didn't put the commissioner of
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
agriculture in a position of of making
 
05:08:40.110 --> 05:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
decisions on what was legal or not so so
 
05:08:42.310 --> 05:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
I I certainly appreciate that and have
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
often advised that but when they are
 
05:08:47.910 --> 05:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
intricately tied together and cannot
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
operate separately than they need to be
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
in my opinion in one bill I ultimately
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't think that any of the things in
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill are necessary if the
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
underlying problems particularly are are
 
05:09:06.190 --> 05:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh addressed I have had no no situations
 
05:09:08.310 --> 05:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
where I've had any questions about
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
applications where
 
05:09:11.788 --> 05:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
um the law wasn't
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
followed nor have uh any any any issues
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
Arisen where there appeared not to have
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
been good reason for um seizing the
 
05:09:27.270 --> 05:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
animals I think all of this has got to
 
05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
do with the Lee case which in my opinion
 
05:09:33.510 --> 05:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
which I couldn't apply my opinion to the
 
05:09:36.628 --> 05:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
legal standard the animals were not
 
05:09:39.590 --> 05:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
seized they were
 
05:09:42.430 --> 05:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
appeared to be using the section of the
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
law that allowed for protective custody
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
which does not in my opinion apply when
 
05:09:51.628 --> 05:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
um the owners were present and that
 
05:09:53.910 --> 05:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
allowed the animals not to be seized but
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
to be taken into protective custody that
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
created a real mess and I and I
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that that is addressed in
 
05:10:04.390 --> 05:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
616 and whatever form to take care of
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
some of the problems that exist um so I
 
05:10:09.948 --> 05:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
mean I don't think that the second part
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill we're we're talking about uh
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
does any real harm except again the
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
language has to be consistent because on
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
the one hand 616 and I know you don't
 
05:10:26.590 --> 05:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
want to talk about it talks about the
 
05:10:26.600 --> 05:10:27.510 align:start position:0%
want to talk about it talks about the
state

05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:10:30.150 --> 05:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarian this talks about someone
 
05:10:33.310 --> 05:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
with specific knowledge and the care of
 
05:10:35.788 --> 05:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
those animals that is not necessarily
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
going to be the state veterinarian
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
because like any practitioner they have
 
05:10:43.708 --> 05:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
limited knowledge they are not
 
05:10:47.350 --> 05:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be experts in the
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
care of ferrets or any number of of
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
areas you know the state veterinarian is
 
05:10:59.070 --> 05:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
particularly knowledgeable about bovine
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
but not others so we have to be careful
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
about having two sets of Standards
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
because somebody could think well we
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
consulted with the state veterinarian
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
sees the animals and then I could say
 
05:11:10.990 --> 05:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
well the state veterinarian doesn't
 
05:11:12.788 --> 05:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
actually know anything about
 
05:11:17.390 --> 05:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
Frets and so then what do we do so
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you sir so uh
 
05:11:24.390 --> 05:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh it seems that um I I'm I I I
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this not having read it in
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of detail um and with the
 
05:11:39.788 --> 05:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
general idea that it was um to do
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
something about the Lee case um but uh
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
looking at it more carefully it seems
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
like what this is trying to do is have
 
05:11:50.430 --> 05:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
you make a determination about whether
 
05:11:53.670 --> 05:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
something was properly seized and if
 
05:11:56.430 --> 05:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
that was not the case then uh deny
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
funding for it and uh is
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh is it something is that an
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate um thing for you be to be
 
05:12:09.390 --> 05:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
doing when you assessing applications
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
for funding under the cost of care fund
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
I do not believe so because the animals
 
05:12:17.708 --> 05:12:17.718 align:start position:0%
that would be seized and let me be
 
05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
clear none of the animals in the in the
 
05:12:23.030 --> 05:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
Lee case there has been no application
 
05:12:25.788 --> 05:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
to the fund and I would deny that if
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
there were because the animals were not
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
seized because no arrest was made which
 
05:12:37.310 --> 05:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
was required under law in order for they
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
um them to be eligible so the Lee case
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with it I make
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
determination certainly on
 
05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
fines um based on the
 
05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
law when it comes to any number of
 
05:12:51.680 --> 05:12:52.910 align:start position:0%
law when it comes to any number of
things

05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
pesticides you name it I do make those
 
05:12:58.470 --> 05:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
determinations to issue fines but never
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
am I put in this situation to judge
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether the state police County Town
 
05:13:06.000 --> 05:13:06.948 align:start position:0%
whether the state police County Town
acted

05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
acted
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
lawfully and in all the other cases is
 
05:13:12.390 --> 05:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
there is a internal adjudication system
 
05:13:14.830 --> 05:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
where those appeals can be made this
 
05:13:16.548 --> 05:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
would be something that could only I
 
05:13:20.868 --> 05:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
think be appeal to the to the courts and
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
so if a police department sees this I
 
05:13:25.310 --> 05:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
said I'm not paying now we've got you
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
know the town of Hudson suing the
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture because I
 
05:13:33.470 --> 05:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
determined that they acted unlawfully I
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
I can't be put in that situation that is
 
05:13:39.510 --> 05:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
just to me that is ridiculous
 
05:13:43.150 --> 05:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
okay so uh my question to you is
 
05:13:46.030 --> 05:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the cost of care fund and and
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
you making decisions about when funds
 
05:13:51.948 --> 05:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
should be released or applied to cost of
 
05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
care um what are the parameters are that
 
05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
that you consider yeah certainly first
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
of all we need you know to know what the
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
case was so it's you know town of XYZ
 
05:14:08.400 --> 05:14:09.788 align:start position:0%
case was so it's you know town of XYZ
versus

05:14:09.788 --> 05:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
versus
 
05:14:12.990 --> 05:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
you know Sally Jones and we can see if
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
in fact there's a case we're usually
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
aware of them anyhow and then there is a
 
05:14:22.670 --> 05:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
perdum uh for the care of of types of
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
animals and then there are Veterinary
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
spes and the state veterinarian goes
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
through those and determines whether or
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
not um the particular type of care was
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
an emergency or not because we only pay
 
05:14:39.868 --> 05:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
for emergency veterinary care not oh
 
05:14:41.910 --> 05:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
well it needs its toenails clipped or it
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
needs a rabies vaccination we think it
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
may not be you know up to speed and
 
05:14:50.788 --> 05:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes it needs grooming and that
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
would be in a case where the conditions
 
05:14:55.628 --> 05:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
were horrific and the thing is covered
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
with lice or you know fleas or or
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
something but if it was just oh we
 
05:15:04.430 --> 05:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to give it a bath we we wouldn't
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
pay for that so there is a process we go
 
05:15:10.110 --> 05:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
and look look at what are the conditions
 
05:15:11.390 --> 05:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
what are the
 
05:15:13.868 --> 05:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances um that led to the medical
 
05:15:17.070 --> 05:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
care does your agency have rules we do
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
have rules uh having to do with what are
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh dis dispensation for
 
05:15:26.070 --> 05:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
funds and which are not so there are
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
rules but they don't you know and they
 
05:15:32.190 --> 05:15:32.200 align:start position:0%
get down into the maximum cost per day
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
po you know for horses for dogs for cats
 
05:15:38.190 --> 05:15:38.200 align:start position:0%
for Birds um do you do you have the
 
05:15:40.948 --> 05:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
section of uh rules that this falls
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
under I do not uh that is you can go to
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
the web the website and find the the uh
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
rules there I mean I think that would be
 
05:15:51.750 --> 05:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
as easy just to look on the Department's
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
websites look on the department of
 
05:15:56.830 --> 05:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
animal industry look at the cost of care
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
and the rules that go go with that
 
05:16:02.910 --> 05:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
application okay any questions from the
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%

benette thank you madam chair members of
 
05:16:33.070 --> 05:16:33.080 align:start position:0%

representing the New Hampshire Farm
 
05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau as a federation's policy
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
director I me as I mentioned mentioned
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
earlier there were three bills that we
 
05:16:45.150 --> 05:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
worked on with the chair with uh
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and representative
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
comtois and this is number two of the
 
05:16:49.600 --> 05:16:51.510 align:start position:0%
comtois and this is number two of the
three

05:16:51.510 --> 05:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
and what it does is add some uh language
 
05:16:59.470 --> 05:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
in the the uh cost of care fund now the
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
RSA now the cost of care fund was
 
05:17:05.590 --> 05:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
established it two two years
 
05:17:08.030 --> 05:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
ago maybe four years ago maybe fairly
 
05:17:10.590 --> 05:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
recently anyway for the for the purposes
 
05:17:12.830 --> 05:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
of and I believe I'm I I wrote down the
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
quote assisting municipalities in in
 
05:17:18.030 --> 05:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
covering cost of care and cured from
 
05:17:19.548 --> 05:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
caring for Animals pending the
 
05:17:21.510 --> 05:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
resolution of any action brought for
 
05:17:21.520 --> 05:17:23.470 align:start position:0%
resolution of any action brought for
animal

05:17:23.470 --> 05:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
animal
 
05:17:23.480 --> 05:17:25.430 align:start position:0%
animal
cruelty

05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
cruelty
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
and another statute you may want to be
 
05:17:31.270 --> 05:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
aware of most of you probably are but I
 
05:17:33.270 --> 05:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out in the in the

animal or
 
05:18:09.110 --> 05:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
animals and what we're again as as the
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner said what uh what these
 
05:18:14.990 --> 05:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and the bill you've heard
 
05:18:17.910 --> 05:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
about that's coming up are addressing is
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
is a situation in Lee which you'll hear
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
a lot more about and there are a couple
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
other situations that were similar and
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
would wanted to tie the fact that in
 
05:18:29.948 --> 05:18:29.958 align:start position:0%
that situation uh for whatever reason
 
05:18:32.750 --> 05:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
the officials uh in where livestock were
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
were were taken um did not consult with
 
05:18:40.390 --> 05:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
with anybody with expertise in livestock
 
05:18:42.270 --> 05:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
care the care of the livestock that were
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
seized and our thinking was that um
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
prior to the commissioner uh releasing
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
funds that there should be some type of
 
05:18:53.470 --> 05:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
check off where there's an insurance
 
05:18:56.590 --> 05:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
that an insurance that uh you know that
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
expertise was
 
05:19:01.110 --> 05:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
consulted um getting to the exact
 
05:19:03.868 --> 05:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and looking at it
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we're in agreement that the the uh
 
05:19:10.830 --> 05:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
the language stating law lawfully is is
 
05:19:13.070 --> 05:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
is goes above and beyond what would be
 
05:19:15.868 --> 05:19:15.878 align:start position:0%
required that that does a step up where
 
05:19:17.948 --> 05:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
he the commission would have to consult
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
with expertise in his Department that he
 
05:19:23.310 --> 05:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
he doesn't he doesn't really have and
 
05:19:25.310 --> 05:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
what we're really looking for is that
 
05:19:27.310 --> 05:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
there just be assurances that there was
 
05:19:31.708 --> 05:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
a a you know a consultation a discussion
 
05:19:31.718 --> 05:19:32.708 align:start position:0%
a a you know a consultation a discussion
with

05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:19:37.390 --> 05:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
expertise uh whether it be you know an
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
extension livestock
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
specialist uh a known expert in the
 
05:19:44.910 --> 05:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
field a uh assurance that was a
 
05:19:47.470 --> 05:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that had some uh you know
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the of the the livestock
 
05:19:52.590 --> 05:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
bnc's we we know we we see that as part
 
05:19:56.350 --> 05:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
of uh it's a due process for for the the
 
05:19:59.788 --> 05:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
animal owner I have uh I've talked with
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor represent ktoa and and and
 
05:20:06.150 --> 05:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
she's in she's in agreement of of
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
striking the the lawful language um I I
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
as you heard the commissioner speak and
 
05:20:15.470 --> 05:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
I've talked with him and and um I I I
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
obviously you heard that he he obviously
 
05:20:19.548 --> 05:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
you know feels it's a that's a burden
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
and like I said we agree we also uh
 
05:20:27.070 --> 05:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
aren't opposed to you rolling it into uh
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh the bill coming up um we that's kind
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
of where we had it but we thought it I
 
05:20:33.628 --> 05:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
know why it was parsel all because it
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
does deal with the cost of care fund and
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
there was a lot there we were trying to
 
05:20:40.590 --> 05:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
trying to uh I think just uh uh I know
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
help everybody's understanding by
 
05:20:44.510 --> 05:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
talking about these issues separately so
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
I uh I think I've covered what I wanted
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
to say Madam chair and I I'll oh excuse
 
05:20:51.590 --> 05:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
me there is one thing that if you were
 
05:20:54.670 --> 05:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this in in in any
 
05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
way um would also need some amending
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
language in 644 itself uh relative to so
 
05:21:04.270 --> 05:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
that people would know UPF front that if
 
05:21:06.030 --> 05:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh a municipality is applying for this
 
05:21:07.708 --> 05:21:07.718 align:start position:0%
cost of care funding that they do need
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
to uh consult with uh individuals and
 
05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
again part of it is just we we want it
 
05:21:16.708 --> 05:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
to be upfront and so that uh
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities know before incurring
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
funding that okay we've got to do this
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
we we got to make sure that our you know
 
05:21:26.270 --> 05:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
our our officials are trained to know
 
05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
that they they need to bring in some
 
05:21:30.430 --> 05:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
expertise which is what we are striving
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
for so thank you for your time and
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
attention as always and I'll leave it
 
05:21:37.868 --> 05:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
that okay representative Bixby yes so um
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that you would be
 
05:21:42.910 --> 05:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to putting this into
 
05:21:45.350 --> 05:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
616 I'm sorry if I said that I meant the
 
05:21:47.548 --> 05:21:47.558 align:start position:0%
exact opposite oh so you would be you
 
05:21:51.270 --> 05:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
would be okay if we it this and then
 
05:21:53.868 --> 05:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
worked and then decided when we were
 
05:21:56.430 --> 05:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
looking at 66 if there was some way to
 
05:21:57.868 --> 05:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
if it was appropriate to work it into
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
that rolling it into correct yes okay so
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
you would be in favor of that're that
 
05:22:07.230 --> 05:22:07.240 align:start position:0%

identify the why the how and The Who
 
05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
of controlling unwanted
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
rodents the why is an obvious
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
one rodents are
 
05:24:53.350 --> 05:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
pests uh these traps these um adhesive
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:59.360 --> 05:25:01.390 align:start position:0%
 
to

05:25:01.390 --> 05:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:25:01.400 --> 05:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
to
catch

05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
catch
 
05:25:08.590 --> 05:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
rodents also catch animals and Wildlife
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
for which we have plenty of
 
05:25:14.590 --> 05:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
evidence they ins snare non-target
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
innocent Wildlife including song birds
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
squirrels of both colors I would imagine
 
05:25:24.990 --> 05:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
kittens and the
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
like they represent in my view a 19th
 
05:25:29.040 --> 05:25:30.270 align:start position:0%
like they represent in my view a 19th
century

05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
century
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
solution when 2 first century
 
05:25:36.510 --> 05:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
mitigations are
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
available last session we we heard
 
05:25:41.788 --> 05:25:41.798 align:start position:0%
testimony on this issue that there are
 
05:25:45.310 --> 05:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
no viable alternatives to these
 
05:25:49.150 --> 05:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
traps those who support this bill
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
inaccurate in the not too distant
 
05:25:59.948 --> 05:25:59.958 align:start position:0%
past first generation rodenticides were
 
05:26:03.070 --> 05:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
thought to be the only viable response
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
to Pest
 
05:26:08.590 --> 05:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
Removal until their toxicity led to the
 
05:26:12.910 --> 05:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
development of second generation
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
rodenticides today we have evidence that
 
05:26:18.750 --> 05:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
rodents and other animals caught in glue
 
05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
traps face a slow painful and extremely
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
drawn out death until they die of
 
05:26:33.150 --> 05:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
starvation in a panic to escape they
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
often rip off patches of skin fur and
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
even chew off body parts in a vain
 
05:26:44.230 --> 05:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
attempt to free
 
05:26:46.670 --> 05:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
themselves now we learn that there are
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
additional more Humane treatments
 
05:26:51.390 --> 05:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
available for rodent
 
05:26:55.270 --> 05:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
control as to the how addressing Pest
 
05:26:58.150 --> 05:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
Control begins with
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
exclusion or habitat
 
05:27:03.788 --> 05:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
mitigation this is common
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
sense after that the options for Pest
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
Control include clude infrared solar
 
05:27:13.990 --> 05:27:14.000 align:start position:0%

05:27:16.868 --> 05:27:16.878 align:start position:0%

effect please note that we Exempted the
 
05:27:55.310 --> 05:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
use of insect repellents in this
 
05:28:00.110 --> 05:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
ban lastly as to the who multiple
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
organizations have outlawed these glut
 
05:28:06.510 --> 05:28:06.520 align:start position:0%

Scotland Ireland Iceland and New Zealand
 
05:28:43.110 --> 05:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
for just a
 
05:28:47.350 --> 05:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
few with knowledge comes action it's
 
05:28:49.868 --> 05:28:49.878 align:start position:0%
time to act on these merciless glue
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
traps in favor of Humane 21st century
 
05:28:56.510 --> 05:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
methods of pest
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
control and lastly I would just say that
 
05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
I I've heard that it's a tool in the
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
toolbox and it reminded me that when I'm
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
trying to kill a mosquito before it
 
05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
bites me I don't use a
 
05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer this is an animal cruelty
 
05:29:20.510 --> 05:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
Bill the reason why we we have received
 
05:29:24.990 --> 05:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
over 200 emails in support of this bill
 
05:29:28.430 --> 05:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
and why you see the people behind me is
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
evidence of the reality that animals and
 
05:29:35.430 --> 05:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
Wildlife are being caught and tortured
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
in these
 
05:29:40.628 --> 05:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
traps I'll stop here and let the folks
 
05:29:44.590 --> 05:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
behind me make the case why these traps
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
outlawed thank you representative King
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
you have a question thank you madam
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony um two questions I don't
 
05:29:57.070 --> 05:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
know who I don't know who's going to
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
come after you to speak so I don't know
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going to get anybody who speaks
 
05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of the glue traps but um if you
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
can't find these in stores anymore how
 
05:30:08.470 --> 05:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
are people getting them are they getting
 
05:30:11.548 --> 05:30:11.558 align:start position:0%
them online and then my second question
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
is why if you can put yourself in the
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
shoes of the person who would use these
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
why are people feeling like they still
 
05:30:22.708 --> 05:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
need these or want these or why are they
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
being used at all so those two questions
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
firstly you can find them in plenty of
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
places I just mentioned places that
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
aren't unwilling to sell them um why are
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
they being used they're effective
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
they're very sticky
 
05:30:41.868 --> 05:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
the problem is that they don't exclude
 
05:30:44.310 --> 05:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
the kinds of wandering Critters that you
 
05:30:46.868 --> 05:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
find in a barn and other places on your
 
05:30:50.470 --> 05:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
property from getting stuck on them and
 
05:30:54.270 --> 05:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
they're extremely difficult to extract
 
05:30:57.310 --> 05:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
those that get caught on them from them
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
um but why would people choose a sticky
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
glue trap over say uh a spring loaded
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
you know mouse trap or something like
 
05:31:06.510 --> 05:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
that well of course I don't know why
 
05:31:09.310 --> 05:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
they would because I would not MH so I
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
don't I don't feel that I can answer the
 
05:31:14.590 --> 05:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
question all I all I could say is they
 
05:31:19.230 --> 05:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
work mhm but they the cost of what they
 
05:31:21.948 --> 05:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
do is not worth it when there are other
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
Humane Alternatives thank you
 
05:31:24.120 --> 05:31:25.270 align:start position:0%
Humane Alternatives thank you
representative

05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:31:27.390 --> 05:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
Barber thank you madam chair
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins could you give
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
me a clarification please does hb152
 
05:31:36.270 --> 05:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
effect uh sticky traps um used for
 
05:31:38.510 --> 05:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
insect control thank you for that
 
05:31:40.750 --> 05:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
question no they do not there is no
 
05:31:44.270 --> 05:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
mention in this bill about insects uh
 
05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is merely a bill to Outlaw a
 
05:31:51.590 --> 05:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
certain type of adhesive backed trap
 
05:31:55.390 --> 05:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
that is used for rodents thank you
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah I have a question
 
05:32:01.030 --> 05:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
about um how the enforcement works so
 
05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
does this require the Department of
 
05:32:06.510 --> 05:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
Agriculture to enforce the sales um
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
prohibition thank you for the question
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
no this would come under the trade and
 
05:32:15.708 --> 05:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
commerce act um they would have to do
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
the uh sale prohibition rather than the
 
05:32:22.750 --> 05:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture thank you okay
 
05:32:25.628 --> 05:32:25.638 align:start position:0%
representative Gruber yes uh thank you
 
05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair and thank you for
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
testifying the um I understand that um
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
people buy a lot of things online now um
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
and uh sometimes if you try to buy a
 
05:32:39.310 --> 05:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
pesticide they say not in this state not
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
this state uh would that be uh possible
 
05:32:44.190 --> 05:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
with this too if this pass to be able to
 
05:32:47.310 --> 05:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
stop the online purchase of these well I
 
05:32:49.548 --> 05:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
I didn't take that up in the bill it's
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
an excellent question I guess I was
 
05:32:54.390 --> 05:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
concerned with New Hampshire to start
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
there um obviously the different states
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
do have different laws and I'm concerned
 
05:33:03.788 --> 05:33:03.798 align:start position:0%
that we start with our own state so my
 
05:33:06.670 --> 05:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
my one thought if this passes then uh
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
trying to uh stop
 
05:33:10.270 --> 05:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
online purchases through that process
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
that they seem to have I'd be glad if we
 
05:33:14.510 --> 05:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
reduced them at the very least right
 
05:33:14.520 --> 05:33:15.190 align:start position:0%
reduced them at the very least right
thank

05:33:15.190 --> 05:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:33:19.150 --> 05:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
you um my question to you is
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
um so how do you differentiate
 
05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
between a glue board that's used to trap
 
05:33:32.190 --> 05:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
a mouse or rat versus a glue board that
 
05:33:38.750 --> 05:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
is used to uh capture spiders or uh um
 
05:33:42.070 --> 05:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
cockroaches or some
 
05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
other well insect yeah in the regard to
 
05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
Insects it's not the case that they're
 
05:33:52.270 --> 05:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
used these are not used for insects now
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
are there some insects that come across
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
them I suppose that's possible but
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
they're apt to be flying we've all seen
 
05:34:01.110 --> 05:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
the fly strips and many of us have used
 
05:34:04.590 --> 05:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
them because the flying insects are the
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
ones that I don't see why you'd use use
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
these traps for but by the same token a
 
05:34:13.948 --> 05:34:13.958 align:start position:0%
cockroach that walks across it would get
 
05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
caught on it as well but it the my point
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
in saying that was that people need
 
05:34:21.360 --> 05:34:22.948 align:start position:0%
in saying that was that people need
insect

05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
insect
 
05:34:26.390 --> 05:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
traps like fly strips that's not what
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is aimed at but are you aware
 
05:34:32.390 --> 05:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
that there are glue boards that are used
 
05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
to capture cockroaches during for
 
05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
cockroach infestation and also glue
 
05:34:41.788 --> 05:34:41.798 align:start position:0%
boards that are used to capture fleas
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
for flea infestations as well and they
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
are the flat glue glue boards that are
 
05:34:50.110 --> 05:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as um these rodent
 
05:34:51.910 --> 05:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
traps that you're talking about I do
 
05:34:53.830 --> 05:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
believe that there are other mitigations
 
05:34:58.270 --> 05:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
used for those insects as well okay
 
05:34:59.788 --> 05:34:59.798 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for

provider in addition to a Humane officer
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
and recently we had an experience I take
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
care of a gentleman in his 80s and one
 
05:36:23.590 --> 05:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the care providers brought in a glue
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
trap Lloyd is when Lloyd saw the mouse
 
05:36:29.948 --> 05:36:29.958 align:start position:0%
in the Trap he didn't want the traps
 
05:36:31.510 --> 05:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
there anyways but the poor thing was
 
05:36:34.150 --> 05:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
alive held down by the whiskers held
 
05:36:38.270 --> 05:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
I did manage to take the mouse to a vet
 
05:36:44.670 --> 05:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
to be euthanized if the mon law it says
 
05:36:46.708 --> 05:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
animals should be free from torture and
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
torment there's torture and torment
 
05:36:52.190 --> 05:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
involved in those things I picked up
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
that glue trap to get rid of it and my
 
05:36:57.070 --> 05:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
fingers it was hard to get that off and
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
I only had a little bit on we went and
 
05:37:02.948 --> 05:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
we bought a live trap which can catch up
 
05:37:05.430 --> 05:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
to five mice even more and then take and
 
05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
relocate them fix the reason why
 
05:37:12.310 --> 05:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
preaches are coming in um but it was
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
very distressful to the gentleman I take
 
05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
care of to see something suffering like
 
05:37:18.350 --> 05:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
that and
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
screaming and to answer the question
 
05:37:22.948 --> 05:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
that I believe you asked why would
 
05:37:26.270 --> 05:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
somebody use it the person the care
 
05:37:29.510 --> 05:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
provider her husband um came out to me
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
and said where is my trap I said well
 
05:37:33.910 --> 05:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
what trap are you talking about he said
 
05:37:37.590 --> 05:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
my glue trap I said
 
05:37:41.070 --> 05:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
I have it he said well I want it I said
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
why why would you use that when there's
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
a Humane
 
05:37:47.470 --> 05:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
alternative he said I like to
 
05:37:47.480 --> 05:37:49.030 align:start position:0%
alternative he said I like to
kill

05:37:49.030 --> 05:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
kill
 
05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
okay um it's not an easy death and it
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
be any
 
05:37:59.430 --> 05:37:59.440 align:start position:0%

facts I'm not an animal rights activist
 
05:39:00.468 --> 05:39:00.478 align:start position:0%
I come from a line of farmers Hunters

and I know the state bird of every state
 
05:39:06.750 --> 05:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
I work for the Department of Health and
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
Human servic in the Bureau of family
 
05:39:10.990 --> 05:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
assistance I work in the main district
 
05:39:12.750 --> 05:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
office on Pleasant Street just a few
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
miles up the road from here the building
 
05:39:16.750 --> 05:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
is over a hundred years old and if
 
05:39:18.270 --> 05:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
you've never had a chance to explore the
 
05:39:20.110 --> 05:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
tunnels and hear the history of the
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
building I strongly encourage it this
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
past August I was outside during my
 
05:39:26.788 --> 05:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
lunch break enjoying the sun when a
 
05:39:29.070 --> 05:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
supervisor came to me in a panic held in
 
05:39:30.910 --> 05:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
her hand stuck to a glue trap with a
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
tiny Mouse struggling to free itself I
 
05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
ran to get some dish soap water and
 
05:39:36.548 --> 05:39:36.558 align:start position:0%
gloves and her and I worked together to
 
05:39:38.350 --> 05:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
save this tiny Mouse from his sticky
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
fate my supervisor explained to me where
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
she had found that Mouse there had been
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
some noise in another office that had
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
been going on for a few days while
 
05:39:48.310 --> 05:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
construction was going on in that
 
05:39:50.230 --> 05:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
building um and she was trying to figure
 
05:39:51.390 --> 05:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
out where it was when she found that
 
05:39:53.788 --> 05:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
glue trap this meant that that Mouse had
 
05:39:54.990 --> 05:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
been stuck to that cardboard with
 
05:39:56.670 --> 05:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
Superglue for days trying to chew his
 
05:39:58.110 --> 05:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
leg off bite through the cardboard and
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
glue twisting his body getting himself
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
more and more stuck until he either died
 
05:40:05.190 --> 05:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
or was found after we saved him I held
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
his tiny body in my hands and she asked
 
05:40:09.110 --> 05:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
me what it we do now and the answer
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
seemed obvious to me we let nature take
 
05:40:13.548 --> 05:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
its course and do what nature does as we
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
always should have done we don't
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
interfere in his little life as I looked
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
at his tiny face with his left eye glued
 
05:40:21.310 --> 05:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
shut and his right leg Twisted in an
 
05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
unnatural way I realized that he was
 
05:40:26.590 --> 05:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
going to die his death would be slow and
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
painful and it could have been prevented
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
if the state had used any other method
 
05:40:33.910 --> 05:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
of rodent control a snap trap whether
 
05:40:35.708 --> 05:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
wooden or enclosed would have ended his
 
05:40:38.788 --> 05:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
life instantly and a problem that we had
 
05:40:41.070 --> 05:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
created I placed him under the stairs
 
05:40:43.150 --> 05:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
outside the abandoned parts of the
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
building if you get it's like a really
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
great building I really encourage you
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
guys to go to it it's so fun um but I
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
placed him under the stairs um outside
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of the abandoned parts of the
 
05:40:53.670 --> 05:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
building a department that works every
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
day to help people who are struggling
 
05:40:57.510 --> 05:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
help to torture and kill one of God's
 
05:40:59.310 --> 05:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
innocent and divinely crafted creatures
 
05:41:00.830 --> 05:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
because it was in the wrong place at the
 
05:41:03.548 --> 05:41:03.558 align:start position:0%
wrong time no state in America has
 
05:41:05.708 --> 05:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
banned glue traps yet there are some
 
05:41:07.948 --> 05:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
towns this is another chance for New
 
05:41:10.350 --> 05:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be first in the nation this
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be a slippery slope
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
fallacy stretching into in insect traps
 
05:41:16.350 --> 05:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
or the BL Banning of all types of traps
 
05:41:19.468 --> 05:41:19.478 align:start position:0%
and poisons it can just be rodent-based
 
05:41:22.590 --> 05:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
glue traps there's also already legal
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
precedent for this RSA 42733 there are
 
05:41:27.670 --> 05:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
already Provisions for the Humane
 
05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
slaughtering of livestock and that it be
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
as fast and painless as possible in RSA
 
05:41:34.708 --> 05:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
6448 there's discussion of animal
 
05:41:36.590 --> 05:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
cruelty to animals which includes wild
 
05:41:38.430 --> 05:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
animals and captivity that they should
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
not be made to needlessly
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
suffer when our fish and game officers
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
state troopers and most local police
 
05:41:45.948 --> 05:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
officers come across wild animals
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
involved in a catastrophic accident they
 
05:41:49.868 --> 05:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
end its life as quickly as possible to
 
05:41:52.830 --> 05:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
ease its suffering fishing game also
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
your testimony if you can conclude sure
 
05:41:58.270 --> 05:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
fishing game also works to preserve the
 
05:42:00.030 --> 05:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of other dangerous
 
05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
and disease caring mammals such as bats
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
that may be unwelcomed in human spaces
 
05:42:09.070 --> 05:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just conclude with when I
 
05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
first spoke with my state reps about
 
05:42:13.628 --> 05:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
this bill I know that it had died in in
 
05:42:15.150 --> 05:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
committee last year but when I had first
 
05:42:17.708 --> 05:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
spoke with them um you know some of them
 
05:42:18.910 --> 05:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
said oh you should talk to your
 
05:42:22.590 --> 05:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
supervisor and you are my supervisor
 
05:42:24.670 --> 05:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
right you guys control the budgets to
 
05:42:25.948 --> 05:42:25.958 align:start position:0%
how you hire the Commissioners the
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners get the budgets to pick
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
who we use for Pest Control in the state
 
05:42:34.390 --> 05:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
and so the um I always like to come with
 
05:42:37.548 --> 05:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
a compromise for things right like so
 
05:42:40.230 --> 05:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
you could also create a policy that we
 
05:42:42.430 --> 05:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
don't use glue traps in state
 
05:42:44.948 --> 05:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
facilities um I have a lot of other
 
05:42:46.468 --> 05:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
testimony in here but I know you said
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
three minutes so I'll thank you do
 
05:42:50.310 --> 05:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
anybody have any other questions any
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
05:42:55.070 --> 05:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming today and
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony to
 
05:42:57.680 --> 05:43:02.468 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony to
share

05:43:02.468 --> 05:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
you call um commissioner Sean Jasper to
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:20.350 --> 05:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
speak Rob the chair is too big to move
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
around um I am commissioner Shan Jasper
 
05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
and I am in opposition to the bill um
 
05:43:31.270 --> 05:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
and you know you heard well some people
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
say this is a tool in the
 
05:43:35.708 --> 05:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
toolbox in fact it
 
05:43:39.510 --> 05:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
is uh just that and I have tried
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
virtually every method that has been
 
05:43:45.430 --> 05:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
talked about they don't work on
 
05:43:48.150 --> 05:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
squirrels the biggest problem that we
 
05:43:51.750 --> 05:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
have in many of our buildings my house
 
05:43:55.150 --> 05:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
with four Big M three big Maples now is
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
squirrels generally they spring the
 
05:44:00.670 --> 05:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
traps without um getting caught I did
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
get one one time up in the attic by the
 
05:44:07.150 --> 05:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
tail and then what do you do when you
 
05:44:11.070 --> 05:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
have a squirrel in the Attic caught in a
 
05:44:13.190 --> 05:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
springtrap I tell you there was only one
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
thing I could do I put a cat up in the
 
05:44:17.468 --> 05:44:17.478 align:start position:0%
attic that took care of the problem
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to like to hear that
 
05:44:23.190 --> 05:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
either this is a story from that began
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
two Saturdays ago at the Hudson
 
05:44:27.110 --> 05:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
Historical Society where I'm a member of
 
05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
the board of directors and being the
 
05:44:31.230 --> 05:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
person who lives closest to that
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
building I'm on the call list the alarms
 
05:44:37.150 --> 05:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
went off went there with the police off
 
05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
officer saw four French doors had the
 
05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
bottoms chewed to
 
05:44:47.510 --> 05:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
Pieces we saw the squirrel put in snap
 
05:44:50.750 --> 05:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
traps havah Heart Traps electric
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
traps and I put down glue traps it took
 
05:44:58.350 --> 05:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
over a week before we were able to get
 
05:45:00.830 --> 05:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
that squirrel and it was the glue trap
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
that finally got it what are we supposed
 
05:45:05.708 --> 05:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
to do when you have a situation like
 
05:45:08.468 --> 05:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
that and you have a big old 1890
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
Victorian house and you can't get the
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
squirrel out of there I don't think
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
these should be used out of Outdoors ban
 
05:45:21.350 --> 05:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
that but I think we if you don't want to
 
05:45:23.590 --> 05:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
use them don't use them but I don't know
 
05:45:25.150 --> 05:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
what I would do I have a self- storage
 
05:45:27.830 --> 05:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
building I can't put snap traps in the
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
hallways you know that's little kids are
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
at danger the have hearts don't
 
05:45:34.590 --> 05:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
generally work and I'll tell you if you
 
05:45:36.510 --> 05:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't check it every day just like with
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
a glut trap that animal is going to
 
05:45:40.628 --> 05:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
suffer and starve to death just as much
 
05:45:42.750 --> 05:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
as if it was in a glue trap if you check
 
05:45:45.110 --> 05:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
your traps on a regular basis it'll be
 
05:45:48.750 --> 05:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
fine but I do have to tell you um that
 
05:45:51.868 --> 05:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
aside the problem is with this bill on
 
05:45:55.150 --> 05:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
page two uh section two starting on 911
 
05:45:58.150 --> 05:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
this puts this under the Department of
 
05:46:01.750 --> 05:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture RSA 430 pesticides this is
 
05:46:05.110 --> 05:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
not a pesticide I sit as chairman of the
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
pesticides board we do not deal with
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
this you heard the sponsor say that this
 
05:46:12.788 --> 05:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't put the enforcement under it the
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill specifically does it also gives us
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
the power for stop orders and penalties
 
05:46:21.548 --> 05:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
and the penalty for violating section
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
430 under the pesticides law is up to
 
05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so while you were told that
 
05:46:31.070 --> 05:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's not the case it absolutely is the
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
case and if you do nothing else you you
 
05:46:38.190 --> 05:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
need to take this out of 430 thank you
 
05:46:40.948 --> 05:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner um I do have a question um
 
05:46:48.430 --> 05:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
regarding uh use in state
 
05:46:51.510 --> 05:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
buildings um and I know you said that
 
05:46:53.788 --> 05:46:53.798 align:start position:0%
this is not anything that comes under
 
05:46:56.468 --> 05:46:56.478 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture purview first
 
05:46:58.190 --> 05:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
of all is that is that a true statement
 
05:47:00.270 --> 05:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come under state of we don't
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
regulate glute glute traps at all we
 
05:47:06.110 --> 05:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
don't regulate you know any any of these
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
things that are not not specifically a
 
05:47:11.110 --> 05:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
pesticide or a poison I think and I
 
05:47:13.110 --> 05:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into to the other things
 
05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
but no I don't believe we do certainly
 
05:47:17.830 --> 05:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
state buildings you know the legislature
 
05:47:19.750 --> 05:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
can make Poli do you know if if these
 
05:47:21.868 --> 05:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
are being used in state buildings I
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
would have no way of of knowing that
 
05:47:26.468 --> 05:47:26.478 align:start position:0%

so the basis of my testimony has to do
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
with the many existing
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
statutes and administrative rules that
 
05:49:54.430 --> 05:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
contraindicate the use of glue
 
05:49:54.440 --> 05:49:55.990 align:start position:0%
contraindicate the use of glue
traps

05:49:55.990 --> 05:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
traps
 
05:50:00.868 --> 05:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
um if I look out my window and I see a
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
bunny rabbit eating apples that have
 
05:50:07.868 --> 05:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
fallen off one of the trees in my yard
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
and I go out and beat that bunny rabbit
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
to death with a baseball bat that's a
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
felony RSA 2061
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
19B but if an apple grower puts a glue
 
05:50:24.670 --> 05:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
trap in an orchard or a Farm Stand and
 
05:50:28.110 --> 05:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
that bunny rabbit climbs onto that trap
 
05:50:30.110 --> 05:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
and reaps her skin apart and breaks her
 
05:50:33.628 --> 05:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
bones in her struggle to get away and
 
05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
finally succumbs through starvation suff
 
05:50:38.590 --> 05:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
ification or
 
05:50:41.150 --> 05:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
dehydration after prolonged
 
05:50:43.390 --> 05:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
suffering that's what the proponents of
 
05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
glue traps call a tool in the
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
toolbox if a professional wildlife
 
05:50:54.190 --> 05:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
control operator uses any lethal trap
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
including a glue trap to try to exclude
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
bats from a structure like an attic or a
 
05:51:05.430 --> 05:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
barn or a storage shed he'll lose his
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
license and could face fines and other
 
05:51:12.430 --> 05:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
penalties but a homeowner can buy a few
 
05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
glue traps at Walmart put them in his
 
05:51:18.868 --> 05:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
attic and kill a dozen endangered
 
05:51:21.548 --> 05:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
bats and there's no consequences for
 
05:51:23.190 --> 05:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
that at
 
05:51:27.270 --> 05:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
all now if a person who collects
 
05:51:30.670 --> 05:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
reptiles and amphibians like salamanders
 
05:51:34.990 --> 05:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
or snakes if that person uses any method
 
05:51:39.830 --> 05:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
other than hand capture or handheld net
 
05:51:42.350 --> 05:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
he could face an adjudicative hearing
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
fines and other
 
05:51:44.798 --> 05:51:46.310 align:start position:0%
fines and other
penalties

05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
but if my neighbor puts glue traps in
 
05:51:53.548 --> 05:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
her garage and 10 baby snakes crawl onto
 
05:51:56.270 --> 05:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
those traps and die there's no
 
05:51:58.628 --> 05:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
accountability at
 
05:52:02.350 --> 05:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
all it's the intent of the legislature
 
05:52:07.390 --> 05:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
that any person who causes a wild animal
 
05:52:10.990 --> 05:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
a fish or a wild bird to be tortured or
 
05:52:13.750 --> 05:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
mutilated either purposely or
 
05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
negligently shall be guilty of a
 
05:52:15.920 --> 05:52:18.150 align:start position:0%
negligently shall be guilty of a
criminal

05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
05:52:20.110 --> 05:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
offense it's the
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
intention of the state through the
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking
 
05:52:28.270 --> 05:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
process that bats are unconditionally
 
05:52:31.350 --> 05:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
protected against lethal trapping there
 
05:52:33.150 --> 05:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
are eight species of bats in New
 
05:52:36.190 --> 05:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire four are considered endangered
 
05:52:38.350 --> 05:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
and four are considered threatened I'm
 
05:52:40.030 --> 05:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to ask you to conclude
 
05:52:40.040 --> 05:52:40.868 align:start position:0%
going to have to ask you to conclude
your

05:52:40.868 --> 05:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:52:43.350 --> 05:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
comments I'm going to have to ask you to
 
05:52:46.030 --> 05:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
conclude your comments okay can I have
 
05:52:48.830 --> 05:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
one a few more seconds just a few more
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
seconds you've used up your three
 
05:52:53.590 --> 05:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
minutes um in in the state of New
 
05:52:56.910 --> 05:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in regard to endangered and
 
05:52:59.628 --> 05:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
threatened species it is
 
05:53:02.990 --> 05:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
unlawful it is unlawful for any person
 
05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
to take such a species and all stated
 
05:53:10.468 --> 05:53:10.478 align:start position:0%
agencies and departments are are
 
05:53:13.910 --> 05:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
required to assist in the conservation
 
05:53:18.030 --> 05:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
of endangered and threatened species by
 
05:53:21.548 --> 05:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
assuring that any any actions that are
 
05:53:25.468 --> 05:53:25.478 align:start position:0%
funded or authorize them do not
 
05:53:27.670 --> 05:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the existence of endangered
 
05:53:29.390 --> 05:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
and threatened
 
05:53:34.910 --> 05:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
species and are designed to minimize
 
05:53:38.948 --> 05:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
harm and and to to minimize harm okay
 
05:53:40.830 --> 05:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to ask you to complete
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
finish your finish your thought and um
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
we need you to be done because your
 
05:53:49.110 --> 05:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
three minutes is up okay thank you okay
 
05:53:51.868 --> 05:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
thanks any other questions from the
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
05:53:54.120 --> 05:53:56.910 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
appreciate

05:53:56.910 --> 05:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:19.590 --> 05:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:21.868 --> 05:54:21.878 align:start position:0%
uh my name is BJ W I live in Sullivan
 
05:54:23.628 --> 05:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is a little Hilltown
 
05:54:27.910 --> 05:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
near keen and I'm here to uh support
 
05:54:30.190 --> 05:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
this bill the use of glue traps is
 
05:54:32.590 --> 05:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary extremely cruel and should
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
definitely be outlawed glue traps are
 
05:54:37.190 --> 05:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
considered one of the most cruel ways to
 
05:54:39.750 --> 05:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
kill animals they can cause animals to
 
05:54:41.830 --> 05:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
suffer from starvation dehydration and
 
05:54:44.590 --> 05:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
Suffocation as we have heard yeah yeah
 
05:54:46.628 --> 05:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
both Jean and I are ex Librarians and
 
05:54:49.948 --> 05:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
we're just quite softspoken um animals
 
05:54:52.110 --> 05:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
like Jean said can lose fur skin or
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
feathers the CDC advises against using
 
05:54:56.788 --> 05:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
glut traps because they can spread
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
diseases like haav Virus to humans there
 
05:55:03.190 --> 05:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
are a lot of other methods including
 
05:55:05.390 --> 05:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
non-lethal ones for catching rodents in
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
and around your house
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
in spite of having four cats we do have
 
05:55:10.910 --> 05:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of mice and we use a catch and
 
05:55:13.150 --> 05:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
release trap which at least gives the
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
mice a Fighting Chance at survival these
 
05:55:17.190 --> 05:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
are little plastic have a heart type
 
05:55:19.390 --> 05:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
tracks I really can't believe that
 
05:55:21.070 --> 05:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
anyone would choose to use a glue trap
 
05:55:23.548 --> 05:55:23.558 align:start position:0%
but apparently lots of people do with
 
05:55:25.868 --> 05:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences of catching
 
05:55:27.910 --> 05:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
non-target animals such as cats and
 
05:55:30.830 --> 05:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
kittens Birds snakes and aosom and where
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
I handed out shows uh includes a few
 
05:55:36.468 --> 05:55:36.478 align:start position:0%
non-target animals that were caught in
 
05:55:39.310 --> 05:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
traps you they also catch frogs and
 
05:55:42.070 --> 05:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
snakes any little creature that comes
 
05:55:44.590 --> 05:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
across them and usually these animals
 
05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
have to be then euthanized but even if
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
these glue traps only caught mice it
 
05:55:53.548 --> 05:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
would still it should still be outlawed
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
as they can suffer for days ripping off
 
05:55:58.110 --> 05:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
their skin and fur breaking Limbs and
 
05:56:01.510 --> 05:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
even gnawing on their own Limbs and mice
 
05:56:03.548 --> 05:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
are people too they're tiny yeah and
 
05:56:06.390 --> 05:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to uh to eradicate
 
05:56:08.990 --> 05:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
them from your house these traps are
 
05:56:11.990 --> 05:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
just too cruel there is a similar bill
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the US house as well to make this a
 
05:56:17.350 --> 05:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
national ban on this product and some
 
05:56:19.030 --> 05:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
other countries have already done this
 
05:56:21.230 --> 05:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
so please do the right thing support
 
05:56:22.590 --> 05:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you I appreciate you uh
 
05:56:27.510 --> 05:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
coming to speak with us any questions
 
05:56:29.110 --> 05:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:56:31.948 --> 05:56:31.958 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none and representative
 
05:56:38.590 --> 05:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:47.910 --> 05:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
Hawkins my name is Ty Hawkins I am from
 
05:56:52.750 --> 05:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hudson New Hampshire and I am in
 
05:56:55.350 --> 05:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill uh I represent
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
the New England Pest Management
 
05:56:59.468 --> 05:56:59.478 align:start position:0%
Association as well as Fox Pest Control
 
05:57:01.990 --> 05:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
who has several branches uh throughout
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh the country especially right here in
 
05:57:07.548 --> 05:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
Manchester as well as one in um
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um the reason for the
 
05:57:12.548 --> 05:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
opposition I can understand the feelings
 
05:57:14.910 --> 05:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
and and the difficulties that are faced
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
when we see non-target animals that are
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
caught in these traps because that's not
 
05:57:20.670 --> 05:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
the intention the intention is to trap
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
rodents for the main cause of control
 
05:57:26.310 --> 05:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
because of the diseases that they carry
 
05:57:29.548 --> 05:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
rodents carry 35 diseases including
 
05:57:31.070 --> 05:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
haunt virus and
 
05:57:33.468 --> 05:57:33.478 align:start position:0%
salmonella these glue traps are very
 
05:57:36.910 --> 05:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
effectively used in manufacturing food
 
05:57:39.190 --> 05:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
food facilities as well as grocery
 
05:57:41.350 --> 05:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
stores and other places that we are
 
05:57:45.750 --> 05:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
trying to protect food and other uh um
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
other objects from um from the types of
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
diseases that can spread on them when we
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
hear of Sal manella poisoning and things
 
05:57:56.310 --> 05:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
like that that happen uh because of
 
05:57:58.350 --> 05:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
recalls of vegetables in large part it's
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
due because of the the rodents getting
 
05:58:02.788 --> 05:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
in these vegetables and and spreading
 
05:58:06.430 --> 05:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
those those diseases um when we look at
 
05:58:09.788 --> 05:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
when we look at um the the the Banning
 
05:58:12.070 --> 05:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
of just rodent adhesive boards that's
 
05:58:14.070 --> 05:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
impossible to do because rodent boards
 
05:58:16.110 --> 05:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
and insect boards are the exact same
 
05:58:18.350 --> 05:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
thing so we need to understand the
 
05:58:20.788 --> 05:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
ramifications of banning an adhesive
 
05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
board and what that means outside of
 
05:58:25.150 --> 05:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
just the rodents that they're intended
 
05:58:28.190 --> 05:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
to catch yes they do at times catch
 
05:58:29.788 --> 05:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
non-target animals but that is because
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
they are used in a way that is against
 
05:58:34.150 --> 05:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
the label restrictions right on the
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
product itself when when we use the
 
05:58:39.750 --> 05:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
product outside and not in an enclosed
 
05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
space or an enclosed trap it does catch
 
05:58:45.468 --> 05:58:45.478 align:start position:0%
unintended animals and that's not the
 
05:58:47.030 --> 05:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
case when they are used appropriately
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
and according to label so it's very
 
05:58:51.590 --> 05:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to be able to ban something
 
05:58:53.230 --> 05:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
like this when the states of Vermont
 
05:58:55.190 --> 05:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine where we can
 
05:58:57.390 --> 05:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
just go across the border and buy them
 
05:58:59.788 --> 05:58:59.798 align:start position:0%
it does us no good to ban that here
 
05:59:01.708 --> 05:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
because it's impossible to
 
05:59:05.070 --> 05:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
enforce um when we're thinking about the
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
diseases that these rodents can cause
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
we're also leaking about the the the
 
05:59:12.468 --> 05:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
difficulty that insects cause to our
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
lower income housing people these these
 
05:59:18.590 --> 05:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
same devices are used to trap literally
 
05:59:21.150 --> 05:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds and thousands of cockroaches
 
05:59:24.350 --> 05:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
which is a main reason why lower income
 
05:59:26.750 --> 05:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
housing children face the difficulty of
 
05:59:29.590 --> 05:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
asthma this is a this is a a product
 
05:59:31.468 --> 05:59:31.478 align:start position:0%
that is used quite extensively within
 
05:59:34.310 --> 05:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
the pest control industry and it's used
 
05:59:37.548 --> 05:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
correctly um however not being able to
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
utilize these things we we we do go back
 
05:59:44.190 --> 05:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
to a time to where we don't have that
 
05:59:46.390 --> 05:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
the tools necessary there are several
 
05:59:48.150 --> 05:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
tools that are snap traps are one that
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
are very effective but by themselves
 
05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're not they need to be used along
 
05:59:53.310 --> 05:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
with glue boards and other things
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
exclusion and some of the other things
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
that have been
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned could you please conclude I'll
 
06:00:00.868 --> 06:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
stop I'll stop right there yeah okay
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
06:00:04.030 --> 06:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
06:00:06.948 --> 06:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
today um I understand that
 
06:00:09.788 --> 06:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
um if an animal I'm seeing pictures here
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
of uh kittens and large birds being
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
stuck to glue traps and I understand
 
06:00:17.390 --> 06:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
that if left there they're going to die
 
06:00:19.468 --> 06:00:19.478 align:start position:0%
um and I understand that that would they
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
probably got caught there because of um
 
06:00:24.670 --> 06:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
improper use and placement of the traps
 
06:00:27.150 --> 06:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious sounds like you
 
06:00:29.548 --> 06:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
have extensive U knowledge and use of
 
06:00:31.708 --> 06:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
these traps if you were to get a kitten
 
06:00:33.868 --> 06:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
or a bird stuck in this trap and you got
 
06:00:36.708 --> 06:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
to it sufficiently quickly how difficult
 
06:00:39.468 --> 06:00:39.478 align:start position:0%
is it to remove the bird or the kitten
 
06:00:42.270 --> 06:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
from the glue trap uh or is it like
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
guaranteed they're going to lose skin
 
06:00:45.310 --> 06:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
and fur and it just be a total nightmare
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
or is there like like if you just wet
 
06:00:49.190 --> 06:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know run lots of flushing water will
 
06:00:50.868 --> 06:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
they get I don't know know is there a
 
06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
way to remove them there is there's a
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
way to remove them quite easily and
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
effectively now the the glue itself is
 
06:00:59.190 --> 06:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
very sticky however something as simple
 
06:01:01.628 --> 06:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
as vegetable oil used against the skin
 
06:01:03.788 --> 06:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
or the fur right up against the glue
 
06:01:06.510 --> 06:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
releases that glue rather easily to help
 
06:01:08.390 --> 06:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
save that animal and to be able to
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
prevent it from being being harmful what
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
needs to happen is there just needs to
 
06:01:14.110 --> 06:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
be more education on how to properly use
 
06:01:16.230 --> 06:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
these things and how we can uh utilize
 
06:01:18.150 --> 06:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
the tools that we have to help prevent
 
06:01:19.350 --> 06:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
this from happening because it can be
 
06:01:20.990 --> 06:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
prevented it's just a matter of whether
 
06:01:22.190 --> 06:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to go about the
 
06:01:22.200 --> 06:01:23.110 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to go about the
correct

06:01:23.110 --> 06:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:01:28.230 --> 06:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
way represent Bixby so are there
 
06:01:30.590 --> 06:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
um are there glue
 
06:01:34.310 --> 06:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
boards particularly that would uh excuse
 
06:01:36.430 --> 06:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
me are there glue boards that are
 
06:01:39.230 --> 06:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
designed with covers on them or or can
 
06:01:42.868 --> 06:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
they be put into um covered containers
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes as a way of excluding non-target
 
06:01:47.350 --> 06:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
animals yes yes and this is widely used
 
06:01:49.150 --> 06:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
in The Pest Control industry in fact the
 
06:01:50.548 --> 06:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
prop that we aren't supposed to use is
 
06:01:52.350 --> 06:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
actually designed to hold a glue board
 
06:01:54.750 --> 06:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
itself when it catches rodents it can
 
06:01:56.190 --> 06:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
catch them live if you don't have a glue
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
board in there however what happens when
 
06:01:59.628 --> 06:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
the mice are in there alone or when
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
they're in there together they actually
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
just chew each other apart and mutilate
 
06:02:05.548 --> 06:02:05.558 align:start position:0%
and fight and so it's no in it's not in
 
06:02:08.590 --> 06:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
more in it's not less inhumane to put to
 
06:02:10.270 --> 06:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
use one of those stations without a glue
 
06:02:11.910 --> 06:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
board what we're doing with the glue
 
06:02:13.150 --> 06:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
board is preventing that Mouse from
 
06:02:16.190 --> 06:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
being able to be trapped all right for
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
being able to escape and be able to
 
06:02:20.110 --> 06:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
spread that potential diseases one of
 
06:02:21.270 --> 06:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
the issues that we see in the pest
 
06:02:23.788 --> 06:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
control industry often is customers who
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
do want to relocate the mice and they
 
06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
put them back outside well within a
 
06:02:30.230 --> 06:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
matter of hours they're finding their
 
06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
way back inside because of the fairmon
 
06:02:34.070 --> 06:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
that they leave behind they have very
 
06:02:36.310 --> 06:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
sensitive fairmon very sensitive noses
 
06:02:37.830 --> 06:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
to where they can scent and smell the
 
06:02:39.628 --> 06:02:39.638 align:start position:0%
phermones Left Behind from either their
 
06:02:42.270 --> 06:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
fur or their feces or their urine and it
 
06:02:43.628 --> 06:02:43.638 align:start position:0%
just attracts them right back to where
 
06:02:45.310 --> 06:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
they're out so you're basically
 
06:02:47.548 --> 06:02:47.558 align:start position:0%
recycling the mouse coming in and coming
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
out and you're probably doing more harm
 
06:02:50.628 --> 06:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
to it than if you were just to get rid
 
06:02:52.708 --> 06:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
of it in the first place but in reality
 
06:02:55.830 --> 06:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is is uh is the
 
06:02:58.868 --> 06:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
ability to protect human and health and
 
06:03:00.868 --> 06:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
safety The Pest Control industry again
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
who uses these these devices widely is
 
06:03:07.910 --> 06:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
really the third large or the third most
 
06:03:10.590 --> 06:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
um viable option when it come when it
 
06:03:12.430 --> 06:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
comes to protecting health and safety
 
06:03:16.150 --> 06:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
minus medication and medical advances
 
06:03:18.590 --> 06:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's the pest control is a reason why uh
 
06:03:20.468 --> 06:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
Health has become better and people have
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
be have started to live longer because
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
of that life expend dency has expanded
 
06:03:25.628 --> 06:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
over the last several years because of
 
06:03:28.070 --> 06:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
the the the safety in which we provide
 
06:03:31.030 --> 06:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
to food sources and things like that uh
 
06:03:32.750 --> 06:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes since you're in
 
06:03:36.150 --> 06:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
the pest control industry how long has
 
06:03:38.110 --> 06:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
the pest control industry been using
 
06:03:41.430 --> 06:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
glue boards it has been a while for sure
 
06:03:42.548 --> 06:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
um I've been in the pest control
 
06:03:44.190 --> 06:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
industry for 20 years and they've been
 
06:03:47.150 --> 06:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
used uh within that amount of time uh
 
06:03:48.830 --> 06:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
and even longer because it is very
 
06:03:51.030 --> 06:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
effective it's very economical and when
 
06:03:55.670 --> 06:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
used appropriately very Humane and also
 
06:03:59.788 --> 06:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
um for use of this
 
06:04:02.548 --> 06:04:02.558 align:start position:0%
um is this part
 
06:04:05.910 --> 06:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
of a plan like you have integr I've
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
heard of integrated Pest Management is
 
06:04:10.150 --> 06:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
that something that you know you use
 
06:04:13.030 --> 06:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
some in some instances and some in other
 
06:04:15.468 --> 06:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
instances or not in other instances yeah
 
06:04:17.230 --> 06:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
so what integrated Pest Management is
 
06:04:19.390 --> 06:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's an entire process on how we
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
treat uh for insects and other pests
 
06:04:24.548 --> 06:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
including rodents and what that includes
 
06:04:27.390 --> 06:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
is anything that goes from exclusion to
 
06:04:30.190 --> 06:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring to trapping to the glue
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
boards to the use of of chemical
 
06:04:34.548 --> 06:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
products right we use a wide range of
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
different things to make it so it's most
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
effective to be able to get rid of of
 
06:04:40.590 --> 06:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
what the what whatever the issue is and
 
06:04:42.868 --> 06:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
so if we were to ban these glue boards
 
06:04:45.548 --> 06:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
we would essentially have to write very
 
06:04:47.430 --> 06:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of different laws that are are
 
06:04:50.430 --> 06:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
actually written for the The Pest
 
06:04:52.830 --> 06:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
Management right and that would that
 
06:04:54.750 --> 06:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
would include uh those things that are
 
06:04:56.590 --> 06:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
that are that are overseen by the New
 
06:04:58.670 --> 06:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of
 
06:05:00.548 --> 06:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
Agriculture they would need to rewrite
 
06:05:02.270 --> 06:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
several laws in order to take out the
 
06:05:03.910 --> 06:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
glue boards because they are included in
 
06:05:07.310 --> 06:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
that language you in the integrated Pest
 
06:05:11.070 --> 06:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
Management language yes I see yes uh
 
06:05:13.230 --> 06:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:05:17.468 --> 06:05:17.478 align:start position:0%
question did I understand you correctly
 
06:05:20.350 --> 06:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
to say that you believe glue boards are
 
06:05:22.590 --> 06:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
Humane when they're used in the correct
 
06:05:24.510 --> 06:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
way they can be because glue boards
 
06:05:26.910 --> 06:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
should be checked on a regular basis
 
06:05:28.190 --> 06:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
right rather than just leaving them
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
forgetting about them they should be
 
06:05:31.310 --> 06:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
checked on a regular basis so that way
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
if there are unintended catches they can
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
be released safely follow up follow
 
06:05:40.030 --> 06:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
and I was also wondering if you do um
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
exclusion mitigation for the complexes
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
that you say uh they are effective for
 
06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
Co cockroaches are you helping those
 
06:05:54.110 --> 06:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
buildings do exclusionary mitigation yes
 
06:05:55.948 --> 06:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
yes we are doing exclusion on those
 
06:05:56.830 --> 06:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
however when you're dealing with
 
06:05:58.750 --> 06:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
cockroaches you can't exclude them from
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
the outside because they come from food
 
06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
sources and come from only the inside in
 
06:06:04.910 --> 06:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
fact the German cockroach who carries
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
the most disease is and it's the most
 
06:06:09.830 --> 06:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
most uh common roach that we face in New
 
06:06:12.310 --> 06:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those ones are brought in only
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
by food and from the inside they're not
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
brought in from the outside they cannot
 
06:06:17.788 --> 06:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
live outside they have to live inside
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
and so the proper use of of glue boards
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
when utilizing those insects is used
 
06:06:24.190 --> 06:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
inside in protective areas to where they
 
06:06:25.868 --> 06:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
can won't be handled by those
 
06:06:28.190 --> 06:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not intended
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
to yes representative King thank you
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
again Madam chair if you are using these
 
06:06:37.830 --> 06:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
glue boards and you check them regularly
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming you routinely find the
 
06:06:44.230 --> 06:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
intended targets rodents alive what do
 
06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
you do with the rodent once you find it
 
06:06:48.670 --> 06:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
alive we dispose of them as quickly as
 
06:06:51.628 --> 06:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
we can you kill it yes how how do you do
 
06:06:53.868 --> 06:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
that uh it depends on it depends on what
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
we have available too right um we may
 
06:06:58.350 --> 06:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
just try and and do what we have we we
 
06:07:00.150 --> 06:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
aren't able to carry firearms and we
 
06:07:01.948 --> 06:07:01.958 align:start position:0%
can't leth we can't do that type of
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
thing which which can be um drowning
 
06:07:07.948 --> 06:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
it's as as as as terrible as it sound is
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
one of the ways in which we dispose of
 
06:07:11.548 --> 06:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
them because it can be done quickly it's
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
in my opinion because of the diseases
 
06:07:14.590 --> 06:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
that these mice carry and the rodents
 
06:07:17.030 --> 06:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
carry it's far better to have them
 
06:07:19.390 --> 06:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
experience that than to have someone be
 
06:07:22.150 --> 06:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
able to have salmonella or haunted virus
 
06:07:24.110 --> 06:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
or those things that can can potentially
 
06:07:27.830 --> 06:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
be lethal to several thank you any other
 
06:07:28.990 --> 06:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:07:29.000 --> 06:07:30.390 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

06:07:30.390 --> 06:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:07:33.468 --> 06:07:33.478 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair and sorry
 
06:07:36.390 --> 06:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
I'm coming in late I just um I was here
 
06:07:40.030 --> 06:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
last term for this um for this bill so I
 
06:07:43.110 --> 06:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
just had a question about um the glue
 
06:07:45.070 --> 06:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
boards that you're talking about so the
 
06:07:46.670 --> 06:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
commercial ones that I assume that
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're using the so the ones that we use
 
06:07:50.788 --> 06:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
yes are commercially but they can also
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
be available to anybody that wants to
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
buy them on the Internet yes yeah so
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
that was my question so you're saying
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
the ones that you're using someone can
 
06:07:59.830 --> 06:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
buy on the internet correct okay yep
 
06:08:00.670 --> 06:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all I need
 
06:08:02.030 --> 06:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler would you like to
 
06:08:03.510 --> 06:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
take your
 
06:08:06.670 --> 06:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
seat any other questions from the
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
06:08:25.628 --> 06:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:28.030 --> 06:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
Monty good afternoon Madam chair and
 
06:08:29.868 --> 06:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
06:08:31.910 --> 06:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
Ashley Monty and I'm speaking on behalf
 
06:08:33.548 --> 06:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
of people for the ethical treatment of
 
06:08:36.150 --> 06:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
animals and are more than 30 1,000
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
members and supporters in New Hampshire
 
06:08:41.270 --> 06:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
to express our strong support for HB
 
06:08:43.750 --> 06:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
152 over the course of this hearing you
 
06:08:45.670 --> 06:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
have heard many different arguments in
 
06:08:47.910 --> 06:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
favor of advancing this bill and banning
 
06:08:50.708 --> 06:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
glue trps glue traps excuse me across
 
06:08:53.628 --> 06:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
the state I will focus on one of them
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
the impact that glut traps have on
 
06:08:59.948 --> 06:08:59.958 align:start position:0%
animals glut traps inflict an unman
 
06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
manageable amount of suffering on gentle
 
06:09:04.390 --> 06:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
animals and they are the single most
 
06:09:06.350 --> 06:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
inhumane Wild life control product
 
06:09:06.360 --> 06:09:07.510 align:start position:0%
inhumane Wild life control product
currently

06:09:07.510 --> 06:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:09:09.788 --> 06:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
available because they are designed to
 
06:09:12.190 --> 06:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
catch animals rather than instantly kill
 
06:09:14.390 --> 06:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
them animals caught in these traps are
 
06:09:17.788 --> 06:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
left to suffer long and painful deaths
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
after their paws Tails beaks or snouts
 
06:09:23.868 --> 06:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
get stuck to the glue trapped animals
 
06:09:26.270 --> 06:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
panic and try desperately to escape
 
06:09:28.510 --> 06:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
often tearing off chunks of their fur
 
06:09:31.628 --> 06:09:31.638 align:start position:0%
feathers or skin recognizing that they
 
06:09:33.868 --> 06:09:33.878 align:start position:0%
will die if they cannot free themselves
 
06:09:36.468 --> 06:09:36.478 align:start position:0%
from the traps some animals even break
 
06:09:39.628 --> 06:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
bones or chew off their own limbs their
 
06:09:41.468 --> 06:09:41.478 align:start position:0%
eyes nostrils and mouths may become
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
glued shut before they eventually die
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
from starvation dehydration or blood
 
06:09:48.990 --> 06:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
loss most people who purchase glue traps
 
06:09:51.708 --> 06:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
are completely unprepared to find a live
 
06:09:54.230 --> 06:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
animal caught in the glue thrashing in
 
06:09:57.270 --> 06:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
pain and crying in agony even though
 
06:09:59.030 --> 06:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
they set the traps themselves some
 
06:10:01.628 --> 06:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
people who find a small struggling
 
06:10:03.670 --> 06:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
terrified animal will try their best to
 
06:10:06.548 --> 06:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
help but others have reported drowning
 
06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
trapped animals bludgeoning them to
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
death or throwing the trap in the
 
06:10:12.390 --> 06:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
garbage while the animal stuck to the
 
06:10:15.548 --> 06:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
Trap is still alive for every person who
 
06:10:18.150 --> 06:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
is heartbroken and horrified to see what
 
06:10:20.030 --> 06:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
glue traps do to animals there are
 
06:10:22.270 --> 06:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
countless others who simply leave these
 
06:10:24.270 --> 06:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
traps in their attic their basement or
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
their garage out of sight and out of
 
06:10:28.910 --> 06:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
mind where the traps catch animals and
 
06:10:31.310 --> 06:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
subject them to unbearable pain and a
 
06:10:33.670 --> 06:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
slow and violent death one that we would
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
never let go on if we would had to
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
witness it ourselves no animal no matter
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
their species should be subjected to
 
06:10:43.628 --> 06:10:43.638 align:start position:0%
this cruelty HP 152 will protect
 
06:10:45.190 --> 06:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
countless animals across the state and
 
06:10:47.788 --> 06:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
help steer us toward a more sensible
 
06:10:50.548 --> 06:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
effective and compassionate Solutions we
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
completely understand this committee's
 
06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
desire to avoid regulations that dictate
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
the way that people live their lives but
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
this isn't that this bill is focused
 
06:11:01.390 --> 06:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
solely on taking one unbelievably cruel
 
06:11:03.270 --> 06:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
product out of the marketplace to
 
06:11:05.270 --> 06:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate a substantial amount of avoid
 
06:11:07.590 --> 06:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
voidable animal suffering we know that's
 
06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
something that all of us can get behind
 
06:11:11.270 --> 06:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
06:11:13.990 --> 06:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you I'd like to ask
 
06:11:14.000 --> 06:11:15.150 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you I'd like to ask
you

06:11:15.150 --> 06:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:11:20.628 --> 06:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
um do you think the kind of trap where a
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
rodent goes up to the top of a bucket
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
and falls into a bucket and the mouse or
 
06:11:30.070 --> 06:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
rodent is drowned is also
 
06:11:34.948 --> 06:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
cruel yes yeah okay um but the focus of
 
06:11:36.788 --> 06:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is just on glue trap so I just
 
06:11:38.868 --> 06:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
like to remind the committee um I'm just
 
06:11:42.150 --> 06:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of uh of perhaps
 
06:11:46.270 --> 06:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
what kinds of methods to uh eradicate uh
 
06:11:49.510 --> 06:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
rodents which are carriers of disease
 
06:11:51.548 --> 06:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
which kinds of methods you believe are
 
06:11:54.230 --> 06:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
not cruel yeah I mean Peta found
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
Foundation has tons of resources on
 
06:11:59.670 --> 06:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
their website providing um people step
 
06:12:02.468 --> 06:12:02.478 align:start position:0%
by step on how to not only prevent sort
 
06:12:03.868 --> 06:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
of the situation where you might have a
 
06:12:05.430 --> 06:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
mouse coming into your home but then
 
06:12:07.590 --> 06:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
Humane ways that you can if you find
 
06:12:08.910 --> 06:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
yourself in that situation where you do
 
06:12:11.430 --> 06:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a mouse in your house um to you
 
06:12:14.230 --> 06:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
know capture and release that mouse in a
 
06:12:15.868 --> 06:12:15.878 align:start position:0%
humane way without actually killing the
 
06:12:18.030 --> 06:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
mouse okay but what in what about in
 
06:12:20.830 --> 06:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
situations where it's not just one Mouse
 
06:12:24.510 --> 06:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
but you have maybe hundreds of
 
06:12:27.670 --> 06:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
mice I I appreciate the question um I
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
would still just emphasize that there
 
06:12:32.190 --> 06:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
are solutions that are sensible and
 
06:12:33.868 --> 06:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
compassionate that do not require the
 
06:12:36.990 --> 06:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
cruel killing of the the mice um and I
 
06:12:38.990 --> 06:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
don't have examples with me right now to
 
06:12:41.310 --> 06:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
sort of explain but um would just refer
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to the Plenty of resources
 
06:12:46.708 --> 06:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
that are available um on peta's
 
06:12:49.788 --> 06:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
website you representative Bixby so
 
06:12:53.548 --> 06:12:53.558 align:start position:0%
would you consider um having a uh a cat
 
06:12:58.948 --> 06:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
in the house that would um uh catch mice
 
06:13:02.548 --> 06:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh a uh a Humane approach or would that
 
06:13:04.350 --> 06:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
also be cruel you know that's an
 
06:13:05.708 --> 06:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
interesting question and I'm actually
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
not positive on peta's stance on that so
 
06:13:10.270 --> 06:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question okay thank
 
06:13:14.190 --> 06:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
you okay uh any other questions from the
 
06:13:16.390 --> 06:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee do you have written testimony
 
06:13:21.750 --> 06:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:28.190 --> 06:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:31.548 --> 06:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you representative for your
 
06:13:33.830 --> 06:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
patience and waiting for us and I'm
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
sorry this uh is going a little
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
late I can see you're having a great day
 
06:13:44.190 --> 06:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
today so um thank you uh um chairwoman
 
06:13:46.910 --> 06:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
Aaron uh honorable members of the uh
 
06:13:48.788 --> 06:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
environmental and agriculture uh
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I am representative will
 
06:13:53.670 --> 06:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
Darby from Hillsboro District 11
 
06:13:55.350 --> 06:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
representing the welcoming people of
 
06:13:58.190 --> 06:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
national award 8 I'll try to be brief
 
06:14:01.310 --> 06:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
and not repeat what other people said so
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
I'm no fan of mice I uh I have an old
 
06:14:06.510 --> 06:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
house and a much older Camp I go through
 
06:14:09.430 --> 06:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
more um mouse traps snap traps on a
 
06:14:12.830 --> 06:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
yearly basis than I I'm uh I care to
 
06:14:16.270 --> 06:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
admit um but I am worried about um and
 
06:14:18.270 --> 06:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
the reason I co-sponsored this bill is
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
because I do worry about um the the
 
06:14:23.030 --> 06:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
non-target species the unintended catch
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
of um of these glue traps um and I also
 
06:14:29.910 --> 06:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
personally um even though I'm honestly
 
06:14:33.670 --> 06:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
no fan of PETA um don't think that um
 
06:14:37.390 --> 06:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
that uh Lut traps are ethical um like uh
 
06:14:39.548 --> 06:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
was mentioned they lead to starvation
 
06:14:41.590 --> 06:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
and dehydration as they're left for days
 
06:14:45.190 --> 06:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
weeks or months um I think to answer a
 
06:14:47.150 --> 06:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
question that was asked earlier I think
 
06:14:48.910 --> 06:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
that one of the reasons people buy these
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
as opposed to snap traps is because they
 
06:14:52.830 --> 06:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
believe that they're easier to use than
 
06:14:55.150 --> 06:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
snap traps are um but I think that's
 
06:14:57.708 --> 06:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
deceptive um if you just do a little bit
 
06:15:00.310 --> 06:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
of research you'll find that um as has
 
06:15:02.310 --> 06:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
been testified people don't know what to
 
06:15:04.190 --> 06:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
do with the mice when they catch them
 
06:15:06.190 --> 06:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
they're like I've got the live mouse how
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
do I get rid of it they they uh they ask
 
06:15:10.670 --> 06:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
questions on the internet and people say
 
06:15:12.708 --> 06:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
smash it which is fine I got no problem
 
06:15:15.468 --> 06:15:15.478 align:start position:0%
with smashing the mouse but um but most
 
06:15:17.548 --> 06:15:17.558 align:start position:0%
people that are are trying to catch
 
06:15:20.948 --> 06:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
these are that's not really their Forte
 
06:15:23.230 --> 06:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
so they just walk away and and leave
 
06:15:25.230 --> 06:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
them you know to ultimately to starve
 
06:15:29.270 --> 06:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
and um and die due to lack of water um
 
06:15:30.868 --> 06:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
they also get bit sometimes they're like
 
06:15:32.270 --> 06:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
I got to pick this thing up and throw it
 
06:15:34.030 --> 06:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
away because the mous mice is squealing
 
06:15:35.910 --> 06:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
and they get bit which you know you
 
06:15:38.270 --> 06:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about trans transmitting
 
06:15:41.628 --> 06:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
diseases um and they also can just rot
 
06:15:43.350 --> 06:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
which you know is even worse in terms of
 
06:15:44.868 --> 06:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
spreading the disease throughout the
 
06:15:48.270 --> 06:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
house so people may have heard that uh
 
06:15:51.990 --> 06:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
from you know people um my my colleagues
 
06:15:53.468 --> 06:15:53.478 align:start position:0%
in the house may know that I'm an
 
06:15:56.830 --> 06:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
Outdoorsman I'm a Hunter um I have uh
 
06:15:58.468 --> 06:15:58.478 align:start position:0%
both friends and relatives that are
 
06:16:01.670 --> 06:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
Trappers and I have no problem in in in
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
support trapping um as a as an outdoor
 
06:16:08.750 --> 06:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
activ it um but Trappers do have actual
 
06:16:11.670 --> 06:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
rules that they have to follow um they
 
06:16:14.310 --> 06:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
they design traps to avoid trapping uh
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
non-target species they um for the most
 
06:16:18.510 --> 06:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
part they have to CCH uh check their
 
06:16:21.070 --> 06:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
traps on a regular basis or even in the
 
06:16:23.390 --> 06:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
case of underwater beaver traps like
 
06:16:26.190 --> 06:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
every uh every three days it's um they
 
06:16:27.510 --> 06:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
have to go through training and they
 
06:16:28.750 --> 06:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
06:16:33.190 --> 06:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
licensed um ultimately um I don't think
 
06:16:35.670 --> 06:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
that adhesive uh based Road and Tra are
 
06:16:37.548 --> 06:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
um are the right solution for killing
 
06:16:40.230 --> 06:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
mice I think there's better Solutions um
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that there's better uh
 
06:16:45.430 --> 06:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
better options for everyday um homebased
 
06:16:47.590 --> 06:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
P control thank you very much thank you
 
06:16:50.110 --> 06:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
06:16:53.708 --> 06:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
um any questions from members of the
 
06:16:56.910 --> 06:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um I
 
06:16:59.190 --> 06:16:59.200 align:start position:0%

else who hasn't submitted a card who
 
06:17:04.350 --> 06:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak please fill out a card

trying to manage some time
 
06:17:10.510 --> 06:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins can you please
 
06:17:11.788 --> 06:17:11.798 align:start position:0%

06:17:16.150 --> 06:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
seat okay seeing none um I call Rob

Johnson to come speak
 
06:17:24.670 --> 06:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:27.230 --> 06:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you madam chair I am
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
still Rob Johnson policy director at the
 
06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farm Bureau and we are
 
06:17:35.150 --> 06:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 152 is direct
 
06:17:38.788 --> 06:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
drafted um rodent control is is
 
06:17:40.868 --> 06:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
particularly needed on a farm and you
 
06:17:45.310 --> 06:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
know where grain is is uh stored and fed
 
06:17:48.750 --> 06:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
and also where as you heard had some
 
06:17:50.510 --> 06:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
bills recently where there's you know
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
value added food production often the
 
06:17:55.830 --> 06:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know the buyers of their food they
 
06:17:58.788 --> 06:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
require a plan and our Farmers often
 
06:18:01.788 --> 06:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
will you know hire service for that but
 
06:18:04.830 --> 06:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
there why why are they uh these traps
 
06:18:06.830 --> 06:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
use well again and again I'm told
 
06:18:09.390 --> 06:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
they're effective at a relatively low
 
06:18:12.350 --> 06:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
cost is one the second thing and the
 
06:18:14.628 --> 06:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
most important thing that they um my
 
06:18:17.310 --> 06:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
members tell me is it's not a poison I'm
 
06:18:18.830 --> 06:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get away from Poison I don't
 
06:18:21.948 --> 06:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
want to use a poison uh the traps are
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
effective I don't and so that it's not a
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
poison and the third thing I hear is I
 
06:18:29.110 --> 06:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
need options um yeah there are
 
06:18:30.868 --> 06:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
alternatives out there that many of them
 
06:18:32.708 --> 06:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
have tried and they're just simply not
 
06:18:35.868 --> 06:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
as effective in closing
 
06:18:39.150 --> 06:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
I wanted to mention that it was uh as
 
06:18:42.070 --> 06:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
far as outdoor use um that's off label
 
06:18:45.548 --> 06:18:45.558 align:start position:0%
and I have uh and not heard of any any
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
these Farmers my members I work with
 
06:18:49.390 --> 06:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
that are using them Outdoors they're
 
06:18:52.310 --> 06:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're used in uh in an enclosed area
 
06:18:54.708 --> 06:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
whether it be indoors or in a in a in a
 
06:18:57.270 --> 06:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know a box or something like that
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll leave it at that okay
 
06:19:03.948 --> 06:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question oh I'll let
 
06:19:06.910 --> 06:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative King and then Bixby thank
 
06:19:08.468 --> 06:19:08.478 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I hope this question
 
06:19:11.110 --> 06:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
isn't unfair to ask but before the
 
06:19:14.830 --> 06:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
Advent of glue traps and snap traps what
 
06:19:17.628 --> 06:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
did farmers use to protect their grain
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
my guess is cats
 
06:19:22.510 --> 06:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
usually you store your barn your Gren in
 
06:19:24.628 --> 06:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
the barn it's cats okay thank you very
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
much I that's what I use repres
 
06:19:27.120 --> 06:19:28.788 align:start position:0%
much I that's what I use repres
representative

06:19:28.788 --> 06:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:19:36.190 --> 06:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:36.200 --> 06:19:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:19:38.070 --> 06:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
so so
 
06:19:44.990 --> 06:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
um yes uh so when you uh when you
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
introduced yourself and your testimony
 
06:19:48.628 --> 06:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
you said that you're opposed to it as
 
06:19:50.910 --> 06:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
drafted is does that suggest that you
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
see a potential uh amendment to
 
06:19:57.910 --> 06:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
this other than I
 
06:20:00.708 --> 06:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
said on label use is using them
 
06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately I don't know if you would
 
06:20:04.110 --> 06:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
need legislation for that but as you
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
know in in whether it be indoors or in
 
06:20:09.868 --> 06:20:09.878 align:start position:0%
enclosed areas I mean that's okay so so
 
06:20:12.990 --> 06:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
you would you would you wouldn't mind
 
06:20:16.670 --> 06:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
some legislation that uh
 
06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
simply um emphasize the requirement for
 
06:20:22.990 --> 06:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
on label on label
 
06:20:26.190 --> 06:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
use and uh there might be an enforcement
 
06:20:27.670 --> 06:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
cost to
 
06:20:31.788 --> 06:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
that okay that was my next question so
 
06:20:36.270 --> 06:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
um all right uh I had one other qu well
 
06:20:38.030 --> 06:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'll someone if someone else has a
 
06:20:40.590 --> 06:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
question sure I have a question uh do
 
06:20:43.310 --> 06:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
most Farmers or farmers in the Farm
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau utilize integrated Pest
 
06:20:49.110 --> 06:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
Management oh most definitely most
 
06:20:52.110 --> 06:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
definitely do they use any of these um
 
06:20:55.548 --> 06:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
glue Boards out in Orchards where they
 
06:20:59.190 --> 06:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
can't spray things or no not not outside
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
no what kind of pest control do they use
 
06:21:05.708 --> 06:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
out in the orchard areas do you know
 
06:21:07.548 --> 06:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
that's a good good question what I don't
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
know what would be what would be needed
 
06:21:13.788 --> 06:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
out away from a a structure I mean the
 
06:21:15.628 --> 06:21:15.638 align:start position:0%
the the pest control they're using are
 
06:21:18.750 --> 06:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
more like would be for insects you know
 
06:21:21.468 --> 06:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
the I think last the bill you heard last
 
06:21:24.270 --> 06:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
year wasn't as as defined as this to
 
06:21:26.548 --> 06:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
rodents and I know we did have issues
 
06:21:30.270 --> 06:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
there because they do use use uh um oh
 
06:21:32.190 --> 06:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
like an orchard they pheromone traps and
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
they're they're they will hang like a a
 
06:21:36.390 --> 06:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
that looks like the fruit and that has
 
06:21:39.030 --> 06:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
the sticky substance on it and will'll
 
06:21:41.670 --> 06:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
capture you know insects that way do you
 
06:21:45.390 --> 06:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
have any sense of of
 
06:21:51.310 --> 06:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
um the cost of pest damage like rodent
 
06:21:54.510 --> 06:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
damage to crops in New Hampshire is
 
06:21:56.190 --> 06:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
there you know it probably is I don't
 
06:21:58.830 --> 06:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
have that at the top of my head no
 
06:22:00.390 --> 06:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about Orchards again I mean
 
06:22:02.030 --> 06:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
you've all been out to an orchard and
 
06:22:05.110 --> 06:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
seen on especially a younger star
 
06:22:07.270 --> 06:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's a you know a like a little fence
 
06:22:14.110 --> 06:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
or or or a uh around the base of a a uh
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
um a tree or or some they'll be they'll
 
06:22:19.948 --> 06:22:19.958 align:start position:0%
be painted that type of thing and do you
 
06:22:22.670 --> 06:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
feel that uh just as a spokesperson for
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farm Bureau that banning
 
06:22:29.430 --> 06:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
glue boards as stated in this bill would
 
06:22:31.750 --> 06:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to the agricultural
 
06:22:35.350 --> 06:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
Community we do we do again what
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
my my members will loud and clay with me
 
06:22:39.468 --> 06:22:39.478 align:start position:0%
on this bill is it it it gets me away
 
06:22:41.230 --> 06:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
from pesticides that's what I don't want
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
to use if I don't have to okay thank you
 
06:22:46.750 --> 06:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so I
 
06:22:49.190 --> 06:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
remembered my other question um and this
 
06:22:50.948 --> 06:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
actually has to do with the grain
 
06:22:53.948 --> 06:22:53.958 align:start position:0%
storage issue and also uh food
 
06:22:56.830 --> 06:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
preparation area issue and food storage
 
06:22:58.628 --> 06:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
which is
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
um uh one of the standard ideas behind
 
06:23:07.350 --> 06:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh that that's or alternatives to um
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
various sorts of deadly Pest Control is
 
06:23:15.430 --> 06:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:18.230 --> 06:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
mouse what from from a particular
 
06:23:20.468 --> 06:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
structure Barn from a from a storage
 
06:23:24.230 --> 06:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
area what what what sort of what's how
 
06:23:30.270 --> 06:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
how how fine a um um protection or how
 
06:23:32.788 --> 06:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
what size of a an aperture can a mouse
 
06:23:36.548 --> 06:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
go through I I there people behind me I
 
06:23:38.110 --> 06:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
know that can answer that question much
 
06:23:40.270 --> 06:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
better but I know i' I've seen you know
 
06:23:41.990 --> 06:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
I've seen footage where there'll be a
 
06:23:45.270 --> 06:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know a concrete uh foundation and
 
06:23:47.910 --> 06:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're walking right you know
 
06:23:49.788 --> 06:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
diagonally right up the foundation I I
 
06:23:52.390 --> 06:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
think it's very very small area but
 
06:23:53.830 --> 06:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
again there are people behind me that
 
06:23:55.788 --> 06:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
probably could tell you in much more
 
06:23:58.030 --> 06:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
detail and better than what I'm telling
 
06:23:59.948 --> 06:23:59.958 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
06:24:02.910 --> 06:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions from the
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank
 
06:24:08.590 --> 06:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
you again are there any other pink cards
 
06:24:15.910 --> 06:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:22.070 --> 06:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.430 --> 06:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
again am John O'Brien
 
06:24:30.150 --> 06:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
Amherst um so uh Tyler but I forgot his
 
06:24:31.948 --> 06:24:31.958 align:start position:0%
last name behind me our rep from The
 
06:24:34.390 --> 06:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
Pest Control industry mentioned all the
 
06:24:36.670 --> 06:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
diseases that rodents carry wanted to
 
06:24:38.510 --> 06:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
point out that the CDC does not
 
06:24:40.788 --> 06:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
recommend the glue traps to protect
 
06:24:44.788 --> 06:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
human health because uh bites as rep
 
06:24:47.830 --> 06:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
Darby rep uh mentioned and the trapped
 
06:24:49.990 --> 06:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
animals often defecate or urinate which
 
06:24:53.830 --> 06:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
can spread diseases um in another way so
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
they have their own you know downside um
 
06:25:00.430 --> 06:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
I have to address drowning uh drowning
 
06:25:01.390 --> 06:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
is not
 
06:25:03.948 --> 06:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
euthanasia um euthanasia is defined as a
 
06:25:06.548 --> 06:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
good death which is quick and painless
 
06:25:08.948 --> 06:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
and drowning is not and this came up
 
06:25:11.310 --> 06:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the hearing for Senate Bill
 
06:25:13.830 --> 06:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
290 which is Senator wat's Bill to add a
 
06:25:18.110 --> 06:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
definition of torture to statute and um
 
06:25:20.310 --> 06:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
I just have to say please don't don't
 
06:25:23.350 --> 06:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
dump a stuck Mouse into a into a bucket
 
06:25:25.468 --> 06:25:25.478 align:start position:0%
of water and don't fill a bucket of
 
06:25:27.110 --> 06:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
water and put your sunflower seeds on
 
06:25:28.670 --> 06:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
top and let the mice drown because
 
06:25:31.468 --> 06:25:31.478 align:start position:0%
that's not a quick painless death um we
 
06:25:33.548 --> 06:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
have a federal law the federal PCT act
 
06:25:36.190 --> 06:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
preventing an cruelty and torture that
 
06:25:39.868 --> 06:25:39.878 align:start position:0%
specifically lists drowning suffocating
 
06:25:42.788 --> 06:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
burning impaling as forms of
 
06:25:45.468 --> 06:25:45.478 align:start position:0%
torture and if you brought your pet to
 
06:25:47.350 --> 06:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
the vet because your pet was old or
 
06:25:49.390 --> 06:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
suffering and your vet said well let's
 
06:25:51.468 --> 06:25:51.478 align:start position:0%
how about drowning I think you you'd be
 
06:25:53.910 --> 06:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
horrified so I just have to get that out
 
06:25:57.670 --> 06:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
there and lastly uh even even in
 
06:26:00.590 --> 06:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
research there is um a resistance to
 
06:26:03.868 --> 06:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
drowning and UNH was cited recently by
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:26:08.110 --> 06:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
USDA inspecting veterinarian because
 
06:26:11.430 --> 06:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
they drowned 670 animals in a research
 
06:26:14.948 --> 06:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
study and in her report the um
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
inspecting veterinarian explains that
 
06:26:20.030 --> 06:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
euth that drowning is not a form of
 
06:26:22.110 --> 06:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
euthanasia and that they should have
 
06:26:25.030 --> 06:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
looked for another method thank you okay
 
06:26:29.190 --> 06:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
I have a question um so in your opinion
 
06:26:32.150 --> 06:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
what are the suggested methods in order
 
06:26:34.670 --> 06:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
to control a mouse infestation when
 
06:26:39.390 --> 06:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 00 mice in a in a
 
06:26:41.868 --> 06:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
storage facility thank you and I think
 
06:26:44.468 --> 06:26:44.478 align:start position:0%
rep Haskin started out with a list for
 
06:26:47.590 --> 06:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
us um exclusion is the gold standard if
 
06:26:49.670 --> 06:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
you've got cockroaches you've got food
 
06:26:51.548 --> 06:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
so get rid of all these things close up
 
06:26:54.468 --> 06:26:54.478 align:start position:0%
all the holes if if you end up with a
 
06:26:56.510 --> 06:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
trapped Mouse somehow I would say blunt
 
06:26:58.788 --> 06:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
force trauma you know if that's the way
 
06:27:01.628 --> 06:27:01.638 align:start position:0%
to end their life quickly Don't Drown
 
06:27:07.030 --> 06:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:08.830 --> 06:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
06:27:11.110 --> 06:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
for my question um you might not be able
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
to answer this so um and I'm just it's
 
06:27:17.708 --> 06:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
been a long time since I used um and I
 
06:27:19.468 --> 06:27:19.478 align:start position:0%
didn't even use it so we had a pest
 
06:27:21.830 --> 06:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
control company uh was when we lived in
 
06:27:23.230 --> 06:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
conquer there was some mice when we
 
06:27:26.510 --> 06:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
moved into the house and um there were
 
06:27:28.030 --> 06:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
glue glue traps that were in the
 
06:27:30.030 --> 06:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
basement none of them worked uh they
 
06:27:32.510 --> 06:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
just got a lot of um dirt on them and
 
06:27:35.708 --> 06:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
and dead bugs but um what we ended up
 
06:27:37.510 --> 06:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
using were the no kill traps that had
 
06:27:41.070 --> 06:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
like a little peanut butter in there and
 
06:27:44.830 --> 06:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
um and and we were able to use that so I
 
06:27:47.910 --> 06:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
just I don't really know um and then
 
06:27:49.910 --> 06:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
immediately we went through and this is
 
06:27:51.468 --> 06:27:51.478 align:start position:0%
what everybody should be doing I guess
 
06:27:53.110 --> 06:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
is we sealed our whole house and stuff
 
06:27:54.990 --> 06:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
like that but I don't I guess I don't
 
06:27:58.430 --> 06:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
really understand what pesticide
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
companies are doing it and they're doing
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
it efficiently and I and you know
 
06:28:03.548 --> 06:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
they're not leaving things for days or
 
06:28:06.628 --> 06:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
weeks or months on end so I don't um I
 
06:28:09.030 --> 06:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's happening so
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
what is is there any I mean do we gas
 
06:28:14.070 --> 06:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
out an infestation do we do anything
 
06:28:17.110 --> 06:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't like poison at all because
 
06:28:20.270 --> 06:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I just feel as if that that scares me
 
06:28:23.110 --> 06:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
especially with other animals that eat
 
06:28:25.468 --> 06:28:25.478 align:start position:0%
um my so what what's what else is out
 
06:28:28.750 --> 06:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
there besides a snap trap and glue traps
 
06:28:30.430 --> 06:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
what else is there really is there any
 
06:28:32.670 --> 06:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
other yeah thank you and thank you for
 
06:28:35.910 --> 06:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
caring enough to ask that question um so
 
06:28:38.430 --> 06:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
it's all back to the whole IPM model you
 
06:28:40.390 --> 06:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
know you you start with the the big
 
06:28:43.468 --> 06:28:43.478 align:start position:0%
basic things sealing up the house um you
 
06:28:46.270 --> 06:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
can remove them live you can just all
 
06:28:47.230 --> 06:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
the things that you've mentioned of
 
06:28:48.670 --> 06:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
course you don't want to use the poisons
 
06:28:50.310 --> 06:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
because that then will affect the
 
06:28:52.230 --> 06:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
wildlife you know the secondary effects
 
06:28:52.240 --> 06:28:53.628 align:start position:0%
wildlife you know the secondary effects
of

06:28:53.628 --> 06:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
that you know that's you just go down
 
06:28:58.948 --> 06:28:58.958 align:start position:0%
the list to to to do the least damaging
 
06:28:58.958 --> 06:29:02.110 align:start position:0%
the list to to to do the least damaging
thing

06:29:02.110 --> 06:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:04.510 --> 06:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
first any other questions from the
 
06:29:08.350 --> 06:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you very much
 
06:29:12.190 --> 06:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
all right down to my last pin card
 
06:29:20.310 --> 06:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:22.430 --> 06:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
Brady this is a big
 
06:29:24.628 --> 06:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon thank you I'm
 
06:29:27.070 --> 06:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
Daniel Brady from Hollis New Hampshire
 
06:29:29.350 --> 06:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
and I also have uh pest control company
 
06:29:32.868 --> 06:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and I'm on the New England
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
Pest Management Association board as
 
06:29:35.868 --> 06:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
well as the national Pest Management
 
06:29:38.310 --> 06:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
Association public policy committee um
 
06:29:39.670 --> 06:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
on their board as
 
06:29:43.548 --> 06:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
well the uh and we oppose at all of
 
06:29:47.390 --> 06:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
those levels this bill um we we
 
06:29:49.990 --> 06:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of doing our
 
06:29:52.750 --> 06:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
job safely and humanely we
 
06:29:55.628 --> 06:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
recognize um our goal is to protect
 
06:29:57.990 --> 06:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
health and home and part of that
 
06:30:02.270 --> 06:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
includes food food production uh food uh
 
06:30:04.628 --> 06:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
establishments breweries hotels
 
06:30:06.868 --> 06:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
restaurants and any any commercial
 
06:30:08.708 --> 06:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
building really and as well as your
 
06:30:12.150 --> 06:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
residential homes and glue boards are an
 
06:30:13.708 --> 06:30:13.718 align:start position:0%
important part of the IPM program which
 
06:30:15.670 --> 06:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
we've mentioned which is integrated Pest
 
06:30:17.788 --> 06:30:17.798 align:start position:0%
Management and it starts off with
 
06:30:20.430 --> 06:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
identifying the pest you can't identify
 
06:30:23.030 --> 06:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
the pest if you don't see it glue boards
 
06:30:25.788 --> 06:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity to capture that
 
06:30:28.270 --> 06:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
Pest and then follow other labels
 
06:30:31.310 --> 06:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire label requires
 
06:30:34.150 --> 06:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
Target Pest and Target site without a
 
06:30:35.830 --> 06:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
glue board to be able to properly
 
06:30:38.590 --> 06:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
Identify some of these problems we can't
 
06:30:40.070 --> 06:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
just go off somebody saying I heard a
 
06:30:42.590 --> 06:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
mouse we have to go off facts and what
 
06:30:45.388 --> 06:30:45.398 align:start position:0%
we find and what we have as evidence and
 
06:30:46.990 --> 06:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
so if we've removed the ability for
 
06:30:49.270 --> 06:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
these glue boards to capture and hold
 
06:30:52.430 --> 06:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
them it would not be possible to do IPM
 
06:30:53.868 --> 06:30:53.878 align:start position:0%
so we would just have to skip those
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
steps and go straight to chemical that's
 
06:30:58.190 --> 06:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
the only
 
06:31:01.590 --> 06:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
all commercial buildings if you if you
 
06:31:02.990 --> 06:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
deal with food in the state of New
 
06:31:04.430 --> 06:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you're required ired to have
 
06:31:07.788 --> 06:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
an IPM program by law so that would now
 
06:31:10.270 --> 06:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
be out the window because now every
 
06:31:14.150 --> 06:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
food manufacturer distributor storage
 
06:31:16.990 --> 06:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
anything would have to just have rodent
 
06:31:19.350 --> 06:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
control that would be no way of to
 
06:31:22.628 --> 06:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
Monitor and no way to um assess the
 
06:31:24.510 --> 06:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
severity of the infestation or what's
 
06:31:26.868 --> 06:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
going on to even apply for like schools
 
06:31:28.468 --> 06:31:28.478 align:start position:0%
you can use them and then you can apply
 
06:31:31.030 --> 06:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
for uh special permits to use
 
06:31:32.948 --> 06:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
rodenticide well we wouldn't have that
 
06:31:35.990 --> 06:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
ability without the tool um there are
 
06:31:37.590 --> 06:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
many many tools and I've tried all of
 
06:31:40.548 --> 06:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
them the the birth control by sensee the
 
06:31:43.070 --> 06:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
good nature a24 or
 
06:31:48.310 --> 06:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
a24a um pneumatic things traps uh M have
 
06:31:50.670 --> 06:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
a heart things there's myriads of ways
 
06:31:53.388 --> 06:31:53.398 align:start position:0%
to control rodents and they all don't
 
06:31:57.388 --> 06:31:57.398 align:start position:0%
work the same way rodents have um unique
 
06:31:59.910 --> 06:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
and peculiar habits and ability to
 
06:32:02.590 --> 06:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
control them requires multiple tools I
 
06:32:03.910 --> 06:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
know it's not fun just to say it's
 
06:32:07.110 --> 06:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
another tool in the toolbx but if if
 
06:32:09.190 --> 06:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
what we have doesn't work then we have
 
06:32:12.350 --> 06:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
no way to do it as far as using a glue
 
06:32:12.360 --> 06:32:13.190 align:start position:0%
no way to do it as far as using a glue
board

06:32:13.190 --> 06:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:32:16.910 --> 06:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
outside if it's a paper glue board New
 
06:32:19.150 --> 06:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's pretty damp they will they
 
06:32:21.110 --> 06:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
won't last the the the paper
 
06:32:23.910 --> 06:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
disintegrates quickly um it needs to be
 
06:32:26.230 --> 06:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
inside an enclosed container so it's not
 
06:32:27.190 --> 06:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
just going to be left out there for
 
06:32:30.070 --> 06:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
months and months for non-target um
 
06:32:31.708 --> 06:32:31.718 align:start position:0%
animals or whatever to get into it they
 
06:32:33.830 --> 06:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
will become ineffective and those that
 
06:32:35.708 --> 06:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
that are plastic based if they're not
 
06:32:37.670 --> 06:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
within a enclosed container what happens
 
06:32:40.030 --> 06:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
is the film develops on top of that glue
 
06:32:42.548 --> 06:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
with dust and dirt and other debris and
 
06:32:45.310 --> 06:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
they become again ineffective due due to
 
06:32:48.150 --> 06:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
just the environment unless they're in a
 
06:32:52.110 --> 06:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
enclosed container that mitigates non
 
06:32:56.270 --> 06:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
non-target um captures again more often
 
06:32:58.310 --> 06:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
than not the problem is not the pest
 
06:33:01.030 --> 06:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
industry it's people improperly using
 
06:33:03.310 --> 06:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
these products um and again this is just
 
06:33:06.708 --> 06:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
our last last not last but our main
 
06:33:08.750 --> 06:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
non-chemical ability and non-
 
06:33:11.388 --> 06:33:11.398 align:start position:0%
rodenticide ability to control rodents
 
06:33:13.990 --> 06:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bixby so what do you
 
06:33:15.468 --> 06:33:15.478 align:start position:0%
do for Mouse
 
06:33:17.388 --> 06:33:17.398 align:start position:0%
exclusion that's the first thing you do
 
06:33:18.910 --> 06:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
you got to figure out where they're
 
06:33:20.030 --> 06:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
coming from because otherwise you're
 
06:33:21.510 --> 06:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
just harvesting mice and we're not in
 
06:33:22.910 --> 06:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
the industry of or the business of
 
06:33:25.510 --> 06:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
growing and farming mice so you've got
 
06:33:27.510 --> 06:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
to exclude them the problem is and it's
 
06:33:32.190 --> 06:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
not just mice it's rats as well and you
 
06:33:34.270 --> 06:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
can't really permanently exclude
 
06:33:36.708 --> 06:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
anything because they gnaw they can GW
 
06:33:39.510 --> 06:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
through concrete they can GW through um
 
06:33:42.070 --> 06:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
steel they can GW through I mean as
 
06:33:43.388 --> 06:33:43.398 align:start position:0%
we've heard another testimony they've
 
06:33:47.030 --> 06:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
chewed through doors and other sweeps
 
06:33:48.788 --> 06:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
and things that you use to exclude them
 
06:33:51.230 --> 06:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
so exclusion is an important component
 
06:33:54.110 --> 06:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
that you start with um because that's
 
06:33:55.230 --> 06:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
honestly it's a lot of the times the
 
06:33:57.270 --> 06:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
easiest way to do it is to create it but
 
06:33:58.590 --> 06:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
they can get through the whole a mouse
 
06:33:59.910 --> 06:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
can get through you know less than a/
 
06:34:01.750 --> 06:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
quarter inch so the size of a dime
 
06:34:03.070 --> 06:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to go seal every
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
single dime sized hole along the
 
06:34:07.310 --> 06:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
foundation of a home or along any type
 
06:34:10.628 --> 06:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
of building and then you've also got to
 
06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
prevent them from chewing through it
 
06:34:15.468 --> 06:34:15.478 align:start position:0%
which we don't have the ability to do
 
06:34:17.388 --> 06:34:17.398 align:start position:0%
that with our current construction
 
06:34:19.350 --> 06:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
material that there's always something
 
06:34:21.468 --> 06:34:21.478 align:start position:0%
wires they can chew through a conduit
 
06:34:25.750 --> 06:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
entrance um other material that is Gable
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
if that's a word um it is important and
 
06:34:33.030 --> 06:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
we do that you you need to exclude but
 
06:34:35.110 --> 06:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
if that's the only thing you do you're
 
06:34:36.910 --> 06:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
just closing the door and they have the
 
06:34:38.708 --> 06:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
ability to open that door
 
06:34:41.788 --> 06:34:41.798 align:start position:0%
again okay um yeah I have a question
 
06:34:44.270 --> 06:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
first I wanted to have you speak a
 
06:34:45.990 --> 06:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about especially since you
 
06:34:49.670 --> 06:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
have background in this uh in this uh
 
06:34:54.030 --> 06:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
field um speak a little bit about the um
 
06:34:54.040 --> 06:34:55.830 align:start position:0%
field um speak a little bit about the um
Mouse

06:34:55.830 --> 06:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
Mouse
 
06:34:58.350 --> 06:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
contraceptives how
 
06:35:03.070 --> 06:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
long but by the time that those foods
 
06:35:06.070 --> 06:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
that are la with mouse contraceptives
 
06:35:08.030 --> 06:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
how long between the time you put those
 
06:35:10.990 --> 06:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
out and the time you see any kind of
 
06:35:14.468 --> 06:35:14.478 align:start position:0%
results in reduction or elimination of
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
the mouse
 
06:35:18.270 --> 06:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
population um so there's a lot of
 
06:35:20.150 --> 06:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
factors that come into that depending on
 
06:35:21.868 --> 06:35:21.878 align:start position:0%
what species it is you know whether it's
 
06:35:24.310 --> 06:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
a house mouse a field mouse white a deer
 
06:35:27.150 --> 06:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
mouse a rat I mean each species has
 
06:35:28.590 --> 06:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
different gestation and different
 
06:35:32.830 --> 06:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
breeding periods and so it's that's not
 
06:35:34.310 --> 06:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
a lethal
 
06:35:37.430 --> 06:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
um method and so you won't see any
 
06:35:39.670 --> 06:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
results or any reduction in rodent
 
06:35:42.830 --> 06:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
population until something kills them
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
and you know so under certain
 
06:35:46.670 --> 06:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances it could be years with
 
06:35:49.708 --> 06:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
mice and rats living if nothing kills
 
06:35:51.310 --> 06:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
them they just would have to have a
 
06:35:53.670 --> 06:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
continual supply of the contraceptive
 
06:35:55.350 --> 06:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
because it's not a permanent
 
06:35:57.590 --> 06:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
sterilization so you would be feeding
 
06:36:01.430 --> 06:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
them this contraceptive forever and if
 
06:36:03.110 --> 06:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
if they miss a feeding of it they're now
 
06:36:05.788 --> 06:36:05.798 align:start position:0%
able to breed and reproduce and so
 
06:36:09.350 --> 06:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting stuck behind it um
 
06:36:11.948 --> 06:36:11.958 align:start position:0%
so you would see a reduction though
 
06:36:14.150 --> 06:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
because of you know natural they die
 
06:36:16.708 --> 06:36:16.718 align:start position:0%
they fall in a wall they get trapped
 
06:36:19.910 --> 06:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
natural predation so you you would see
 
06:36:23.670 --> 06:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
um a reduction but without something
 
06:36:25.990 --> 06:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
killing them you we'll we'll crush it
 
06:36:28.868 --> 06:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
that way and it's it's goal thank you
 
06:36:31.270 --> 06:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
06:36:33.750 --> 06:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you and we
 
06:36:37.590 --> 06:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
are out of pink cards for today um so I
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
am going to ask for the uh blue sheet up
 
06:36:45.670 --> 06:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
there I do have on the online portal
 
06:36:48.230 --> 06:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
here um we
 
06:36:52.670 --> 06:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
have 281 people signed in support of
 
06:36:55.270 --> 06:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
this bill 10 in
 
06:36:59.510 --> 06:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
opposition and on the blue sheet
 
06:37:04.310 --> 06:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
here 2 281 and 10 in opposition
 
06:37:10.590 --> 06:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 people in
 
06:37:14.868 --> 06:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
support on the blue sheet zero opposed
 
06:37:17.430 --> 06:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to close out this hearing
 
06:37:20.910 --> 06:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
for HB 152 and thank you everyone for
 
06:37:27.990 --> 06:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
