foreign

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
pretty good yeah okay
 
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to go ahead and and get
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves organized here so we can get
 
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 align:start position:0%
on with the hearing schedule for today
 
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh prior to getting into the hearing
 
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
process I'd like to look at calendar and
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
try to give some folks here notice of
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
when we may be meeting whether it's
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
getting nicer and I know folks would
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
like to be out
 
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
thinking about gardening
 
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
although I woke up to an inch of snow
 
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
and ice over everything this morning so
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
it was not not great driving so
 
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
this room is going to be used
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
by another committee on the 4th and 12th
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
of April so that means everything we
 
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
have in the table tops here has to be
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
cleaned off
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
and and so we do the fact that we have
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
so few bills I think it's only 14 bills
 
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
or so that I can count so far
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
a better knock on wood here
 
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
um that we won't be using this room
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
consistently every day of the week like
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
we have in the past just about and so it
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
will be shared
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
um so on the fourth and 12th it will be
 
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
used so we need to clean it off now in
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
terms of what we're doing with the rest
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the schedule here on the sixth course
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's crossover and that's
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to be the day which the budget is
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
resolved uh so that's that's Thursday of
 
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
next week but the following week on the
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
11th I'm looking at doing a session
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
which we're going to be exacting some of
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
those bills if we we will have heard
 
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
that are Senate bills and possibly also
 
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
taking the 13th that's a Thursday I
 
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
don't think there's going to be a
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
session that week
 
00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 align:start position:0%
so it be the Tuesday and the Thursday of
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
the following week if we can get some of
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
this done that leaves us just the 18th
 
00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 align:start position:0%
in which we have a hearing on uh 2272 I
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
believe in reps Hall
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
and we will also have the bill which we
 
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
didn't address yesterday that will be
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
carried forward and we have to exact
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
that or or hear that somewhere along the
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
way here
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I I don't intend to really
 
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
um I I don't intend to really
um

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
try to do something on the 18th unless
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
that we look at that bill we know we can
 
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
get it down quickly maybe do it just
 
00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
prior to the the opening of what we do
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
in Repsol you might be able to do it on
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
that date
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to set it up so the last
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
two weeks or so of April we won't have
 
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
to be here as much and that's when you
 
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
know the the robin should be back in the
 
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
Red Wing blackbirds and all that good
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
stuff that wake you up at four o'clock
 
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 align:start position:0%
in the morning
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
so if your windows open so so I'm I'm
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
trying to set it up so we will have some
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
time here in April it's a wonderful
 
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
night I'm not not to have to do so much
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
driving down to Concord or up to conquer
 
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
so any questions on on the on the
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
scheduling of events
 
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 align:start position:0%
dates for 13th
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
the 11th and the 13th that's a Tuesday
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
and a Thursday would you just you know
 
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
if you're scheduling appointments just
 
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
try to keep them clear so that we can
 
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
use those two days to exact bills which
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have done here the other day and
 
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing today
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
and then on the on I don't know if you

check system protecting children in New
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools in 2020 the

legislature moved the responsibility for
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
performing criminal background checks on
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
Transportation monitors out of the
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
Department of education's Education
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
credentialing system and over to the
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles however DMV
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't have any licensing
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
authority over Transportation monitors
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
these are parents or volunteers who go
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
along on school field trips or uh
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
sports games
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
these background checks ended up not
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
being conducted by anyone SB 39 would
 
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.060 align:start position:0%
put Transportation monitors back in RSA
 
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
18913 to ensure that people with
 
00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
disqualifying criminal histories are not
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
coming into contact with New Hampshire
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
students the Department of Education is
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
here should be able to answer any
 
00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
questions you have if you have any
 
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator Gannon I can get
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
them to him Senator again and thanks you
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
for your consideration and support of
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 39 thank you thank you very
 
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.009 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 39 thank you thank you very
much

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think it's necessary that
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
we ask Grant questions uh he is here
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
conveying for Senator again and
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
um uh let's ask Diane do you have are
 
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
you able to give any technical support
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
on this if we need it
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
if it's needed so are there any
 
00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:26.030 align:start position:0%
if it's needed so are there any
questions

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
from the committee that the department
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
might be able to help you out on yes
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you um I I
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
think he said it would be volunteers on
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
buses and to me Transportation monitors
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
are the people that perhaps are paid to
 
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
be on the bus to monitor like special ed
 
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
buses or something
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
could you clear that up
 
00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
Transportation monitors are paid
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
individuals either by the district or by
 
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:07.580 align:start position:0%
the school bus company to be on the bus
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
volunteers are set out under the statute
 
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:12.860 align:start position:0%
um for their own background check
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
districts can designate they can call
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
them designated volunteers for this
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes represent Damon
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify what you just said
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
which contrasts with what I'm sorry I
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
missed the name of the gentleman who
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill Grant bossy this
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
does not change any RSA related to
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
parent volunteers this is addressing the
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
paid Transportation monitors
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
that are in my understanding sort of
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
employed to do Behavioral Management on
 
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:56.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:05.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cascade
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
um so there's no statute that covers
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
someone who's riding the bus either as a
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
paid person or a volunteer
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
because I would think if the school was
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
putting a volunteer on a bus
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
they would get a criminal background
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
check based on the volunteer policy
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
if they were paid by the district they'd
 
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
get criminal background check based on
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
an employee
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
and if the bus company is required to
 
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.329 align:start position:0%
and if the bus company is required to
have

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and they hire
 
00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
a transportation monitor wouldn't that
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
fall under that auspice
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
or do they have to to me the those two
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
entities should cover a transportation
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
monitor do I I think they should be
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
criminal check absolutely but does it
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
need a specific title
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
that's different than an employee or a
 
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.370 align:start position:0%
that's different than an employee or a
volunteer

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're pulled out
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
pulled out because we wanted to have a
 
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
Statewide certification yeah which
 
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
allowed them
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
the fund that allows them that Mobility
 
00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:57.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
when they did that
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
um we recognized that the Department of
 
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
Education and the department of safety
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
DMV would both be checking
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
bus route bus drivers are held from a
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
they tacked on Transportation monitors
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
come on we pulled out bus drivers the
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
natural inclination would put
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation monitors with
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
Buster in the statute okay okay the
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339 align:start position:0%
the department had no oversight on
 
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.810 align:start position:0%
the department had no oversight on
Transportation

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:40.820 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
they don't supervise them they have no
 
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.290 align:start position:0%
they don't supervise them they have no
oversight

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
and so when we went to work on this new
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
law with our partners in the Department
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles we realized
 
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.670 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles we realized
we

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
right they are as you said it should be
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
an employment issue but by calling it
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
out and putting it in a 189 13c we took
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.170 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:33.290 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
right

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
really playing with you
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay great thanks
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Myler uh thank you and
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
Dan I might want to turn your mic on too
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
um so now that if this comes back to the
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
department Under The Spill who then does
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
coming back to the department right now
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
it's under the purview of the department
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
we're trying to say it's an employment
 
00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:06.590 align:start position:0%
we're trying to say it's an employment
issue

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
and have it go back to the to the
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
district so the district then conducts
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
it that's correct it would be an
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
employment issue yeah thank you
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
are there questions of the department
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner thank you
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
um so do any transportation companies
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
the bus drivers are now subject to the
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
clearance issued by the Department of
 
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.250 align:start position:0%
clearance issued by the Department of
Education

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
that is only looking for those section
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
five disqualifying
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
offenses that would prohibit them from
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
being unemployment
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
the transportation monitors the district
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
can run those individuals and make that
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
determination is that person right for
 
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
our district and let the bus companies
 
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.810 align:start position:0%
our district and let the bus companies
know

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
yes this is someone we want to have
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
employed or no it's not
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
and we've done that previously with bus
 
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.030 align:start position:0%
and we've done that previously with bus
drivers

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
and the problem with that was that if
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
you were working in a couple of
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
different districts
 
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:28.220 align:start position:0%
yeah you could have different results
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
and you you had to go through a series
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
of different checks
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
potentially yes and so we put the bus
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
drivers yes so that they get one and it
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
covers them all now we've got somebody
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
riding on the bus that's employed by the
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
bus company that
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
has to get
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
checks all over the place again
 
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.150 align:start position:0%
checks all over the place again
possibly

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's going to be a
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
is it possible to write this so that
 
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
every three years you have to have this
 
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
done that's correct if you're a monitor
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
and and so is it possible that it could
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
be written such that if it's done
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
through one District may go through this
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
check then that would be good for all
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
districts that person might be employed
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
the problem is employment is handled by
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
the district
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
and each district
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
each district
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
has has the right pursuant to the
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
statute as written to to have their own
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
policy when it comes to employment and
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
what they look for and
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden might have
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
looked for different offenses than uh
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
the neighboring district and every
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
district has that ability and that right
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
so there's not a reciprocity sort of
 
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
thing in regard if it's good here it's
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
also good there
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
we have it with the bus drivers we have
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
we have a solution as it pertains to bus
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
drivers the department of education
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
issues that clearance and that clearance
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
is valid throughout the state
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
however again Transportation monitors
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
are not governed by the Department of
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles so putting them in 189
 
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.529 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles so putting them in 189
13c

00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:30.539 align:start position:0%
13c
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
and having the Department of Motor
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
Vehicle have oversight doesn't work
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
because they don't have oversight of
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation right
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you could a couple districts
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
which is very common would work together
 
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.020 align:start position:0%
to have a monitor in a particular bus
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
share the cost
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
but be the employee of one district and
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
the other District pays the district for
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
the cost of that service
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why that couldn't
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
happen right sure that could be a local
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
issue and have an mou that right governs
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
the terms of that but that wouldn't be
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
reviewed or overseen by the Department
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
of Education nor would you want it to be
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
right but so this that could happen
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
that's yeah I mean certainly it's
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
similar like to a Cooperative right
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
where you bring all these resources
 
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.770 align:start position:0%
where you bring all these resources
together

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Damon
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
so is there anything in this proposed
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
legislation that prohibits
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
a district from
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
utilizing the background check that
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.610 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
so it it does not not this proposed
 
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.070 align:start position:0%
so it it does not not this proposed
legislation

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
but the current law prohibits that
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
because that's a very dangerous practice
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
to get into
 
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.610 align:start position:0%
to get into
um

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:57.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
first and foremost I think and I I'm not
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
here to testify on behalf of the
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety but the department
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
of safety has been here enough that you
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
are familiar with that term well yeah
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh they're always here when I
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I could feel someone staring at me
 
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.169 align:start position:0%
um I could feel someone staring at me
um

00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
stale records
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
stale records that's a term that they
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
use they
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
um the concern is relying on Old
 
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.130 align:start position:0%
um the concern is relying on Old
information

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
and when you look at employment
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
the law allows for each district to say
 
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
you have your list of disqualifying
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
offenses that are applicable throughout
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
the state but then each district can
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
have their own policy that talks about
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
what they look for in their own district
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
and so if I'm a superintendent if I rely
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
on someone else's judgment
 
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
and saying well they were good enough
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
for that District so they must be good
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
enough for me
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
that's going to violate this law because
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
the law is written says that each
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
individual district has to go through
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
this analysis
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
and decide what works for them I think
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's a liability and and I can tell you
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
if I was advising a district I would
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
shudder at the thought of relying on
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
oh well another District said this
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
person was okay so we'll take them on as
 
00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:16.370 align:start position:0%
person was okay so we'll take them on as
well

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.150 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
you would be opening yourself up to
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
massive liability
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
but that's why no one likes to hang out
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
with a lawyer because we we say things
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.950 align:start position:0%
like that
um

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
you all say different things too it's
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
true we do reps and Damon
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
one of my best friends is a lawyer my
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
forgive them I I don't know how to ask
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
this but it's all right so why
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
why don't we have
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
um consistency like
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm naive here but it seems to me
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
that the same
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
concern should apply across all the
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
districts like obviously you don't want
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
to murder or driving your school bus or
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
being your bus monitor for a you know
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
sure more dramatic example I know there
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
are nuances but
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
I guess I just don't understand why it's
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
so different from District to District
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:31.490 align:start position:0%
that's okay
um

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
I think in theory your idea works
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
in theory there should be a list of
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
offenses that say this person this makes
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
this person safe this makes this person
 
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.029 align:start position:0%
this person safe this makes this person
unsafe

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
but the reality is is there are in
 
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.970 align:start position:0%
but the reality is is there are in
countless

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
countless
 
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
crimes out there and reasons behind
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
those crimes that make up an individual
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
criminal record and I think
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
superintendents it is a challenge for
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
them if that's a fair statement but they
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
enjoy the opportunity to weigh it out
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
because it's not a black and white issue
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
there are people behind this and so I
 
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
there are people behind this and so I
have

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
spoken with many superintendents who
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
will say you know what this offense uh
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
came up on the record it's not a
 
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
disqualifier and I want to find out more
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
about it I want to have the opportunity
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
to talk to the person to put it into
 
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.950 align:start position:0%
to talk to the person to put it into
context

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
context
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
right when did the offense happen
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
how old was the person what have they
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
learned from it
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
right what does this look like and you
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
can't do that on any chart or graph
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
you have to talk to the person uh and I
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
think that's why
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
coming up with a list of offenses you're
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
never going to be able to
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
adequately do that because there's just
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
so much to take into consideration
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
I think the section five disqualifiers
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
is a really good start
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's that basic level and then
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.450 align:start position:0%
after that
um

00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:01.700 align:start position:0%
it becomes personal it's a judgment call
 
00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059 align:start position:0%
it's a moral compass call and it's it
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
lies with the superintendent to weigh
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
everything out and make that ultimate
 
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.169 align:start position:0%
everything out and make that ultimate
decision

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
and in my experience they're very
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about it
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and is this similar to a
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
substitute teacher that's not certified
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
you know we have many substitutes to
 
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
come in and don't have certification but
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
they're on the substitute list in
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
District A B C D and you have a hard
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
time getting them because I'm engaged at
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
e today
 
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
you know but I need you over here in a
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh so it is that background check on
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
that person that's done by are those
 
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
mousse or agreements or how it is
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
between one District to another is there
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
something already in place for Subs that
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
maybe we could use for monitors
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh I I like where you're going with that
 
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
we don't have an infrastructure for
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
substitute teachers
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
if that's what you're asking is there
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
some infrastructure that we can use
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
between districts well I'm saying is
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
there an infrastructure that's
 
00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
established by policy at the local that
 
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
the the board or the administrator the
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent make you know
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
superintendent the superintendent
 
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.690 align:start position:0%
superintendent the superintendent
um

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
special guest star local control huh
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you so I'm still
 
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.850 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you so I'm still
um

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
kind of going back and forth on
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
that that it is an employment issue but
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
that there are two possible people that
 
00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
employ these people these Transportation
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
monitors one is the bus company
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
yes and that that may that probably well
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
not probably but may and then you have
 
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:54.740 align:start position:0%
the school district that made
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
so if the bus company hires these
 
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.250 align:start position:0%
so if the bus company hires these
monitors

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
and the monitors actually fluctuate
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
between because a lot of the bus
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
companies have like two or three school
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
districts that they do
 
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.649 align:start position:0%
districts that they do
uh

00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe the bus monitor that's always
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
been on bus five for Berlin is sick that
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
day and so the company says oh yeah
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
we'll send
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
Joe over to cover that bus route but the
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
superintendent hasn't really
 
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
had it you know any information about
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
that person in terms of criminal
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
background checks I mean who's who's
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
liable if something happens is it is it
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
the bus company that's liable and should
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
should they I mean is it
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
their job then to do criminal background
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
checks employment checks on everybody
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
that's that's a bus monitor and if
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
they're a bus monitor even if they're a
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer at Berlin they go through the
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
bus company or vice versa that all the
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
bus monitors have to go through
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
the superintendent or the The Local
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
District I mean I just can't see how you
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
can do it
 
00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:09.169 align:start position:0%
can do it
with

00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
with two different groups and and as you
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
said the liability is you know a pro is
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
the the bottom line really
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
it is always a consideration so keep in
 
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.430 align:start position:0%
it is always a consideration so keep in
mind

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
um a bus company a private company
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
does not have access to the FBI
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that in this
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
committee before
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
even if they were
 
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.070 align:start position:0%
even if they were
patients

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
they can't get back down my
 
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
understanding in my work with the
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and this
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies work with the
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety is there is a huge
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
difference between a governmental entity
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
and a non-governmental entity and so to
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
put it plainly state agency or a school
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
district can get that FBI which is the
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
federal background check a private
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
company Diana's bus company Diana's
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
whatever lunch services
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
I I cannot get access to that
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and and that is one of the factors
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
that caused all these issues going back
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
six seven years when we started looking
 
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
at this issue
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education is in a
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
unique position as is a school district
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
because we can have that FBI background
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
check a private company cannot so Butler
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
bus service will defer to the school
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
district and the reason they do that is
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
because they get information that the
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
private company does not and that
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
information is critical in making a
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
and I wish it was different but
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
but it goes beyond my purview to the FBI
 
00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:54.289 align:start position:0%
but it goes beyond my purview to the FBI
regulations

00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
and that's not something that we're able
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
this reference representative Ford
 
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
is there possibly
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
a built-in conflict between
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
I guess you'd call them competing
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
interest in this in business that
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
prevent people from moving and
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
employment I'm thinking of speech and
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
language Pathologists who maybe were
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
trained out of state license out of
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
state had background chases out of the
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
state and when they come to New
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they won't let them work until
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
they've had a background check but they
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
can't a background check is meaningless
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
because they haven't lived here for the
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
last several years
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing to background check
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
and you can't work without a background
 
00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:44.930 align:start position:0%
and you can't work without a background
check

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
I would disagree with that because you
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
can get the the federal the national
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
and so even if they haven't lived here
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
um there might be information that's
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
critical to an employment decision well
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
my daughter found that they rejected her
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania background check which was
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
done by valid authorities there and she
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
hadn't lived here long enough for a
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
local person to do a background check
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
so she couldn't work
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry to hear that that must
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
have been very frustrating well very
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
frustrating for her because she was
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
trained and needed and couldn't work
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:27.500 align:start position:0%
so what are we going to do about it
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
well I I we have a possible response
 
00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
right here in the form of this bill are
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
there any other questions regarding this
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
bill to Diana
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other cards on this so
 
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:49.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the hearing on SBE 39
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
and we're ready to start here
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
house again for at least for a brief
 
00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.810 align:start position:0%
house again for at least for a brief
moment

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm introducing Senate Bill 109
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 109 came at the request of a
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to give you a short and
 
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
easy version of the bill there was just
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
an issue with law enforcement
 
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
cooperating with the school district in
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
terms of a disciplinary matter for a
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
student they felt that because charges
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
were brought and there was a pending
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
criminal case or a pending juvenile case
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
they couldn't share the data with the
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
school district who was seeking to
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
discipline the child
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
um the the student in in that case
 
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
um and so what this bill does was to
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
clarify the fact that law enforcement
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
can share records with the school
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
district for the purposes of
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
communicating if those you like me who
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
served on the school board you know that
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
student display managers are held in
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions so to allow law
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
enforcement be able to come in and help
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
during a non-public session when they're
 
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
disciplining a student so they have the
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
accurate and complete data
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
um in order to carry out any possible
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action there was an
 
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
amendment done in the Senate because
 
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
there was some conversation around the
 
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
federal family education rights and
 
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
privacy acts so we amended the bill to
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with that federal
 
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
act to make sure we weren't violating
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
any federal law it's a pretty
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
straightforward we also amended the bill
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we weren't talking
 
00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:54.059 align:start position:0%
about medical records only law
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement records and law enforcement
 
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.990 align:start position:0%
enforcement records and law enforcement
conversation

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions again
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
this is an effort to make our schools
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
safe and allow our school district to be
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
able to take a proper just for reactions
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
for students who fall outside uh the
 
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.930 align:start position:0%
for students who fall outside uh the
rules

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
is he any hands up anywhere no no
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden yes
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that this does not
 
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.710 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that this does not
occur

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
So currently there's a there was a I'll
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
call it a conflict in law or at least a
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
conflict and opinion of Law and that
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
they there was some officers felt they
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
could not share the data if there was a
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
pending action on the student in courts
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
so this clarifies that they can in fact
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
share data regardless of the pending
 
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.630 align:start position:0%
share data regardless of the pending
action

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.230 align:start position:0%
my question
so

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
does this pertain to a
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
action that the student took within the
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
school or just in life
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it there's a
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent who asked me to bring it
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
can explain what explain what when in
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
that situation that causes to come
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
forward I actually don't know if it
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
occurred between school hours or after
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
school hours but it was related to the
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
school I'm not sure I don't mean that
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
particular incident that precipitated
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
the legislation I mean the way the law
 
00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:19.339 align:start position:0%
now reads
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
would there be communication about a
 
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
student's potential legal issues
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
in regards to something that may have
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
happened anywhere at any time or is it
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
limited to things that happened in
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
school because I don't believe it's
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
limited to just things that happen in
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
school because again things that happen
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
outside of school can be just as
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
dangerous to what happens inside school
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
later thank you
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative Ford thank you Mr thank
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question we're all
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
painfully aware of the horrible tragedy
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee and it seems to have been
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
at least in part affected by lack of
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
communication of certain kinds of
 
00:34:59.339 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
communication of certain kinds of
information

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh not drawing any conclusions about
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
that but wondering how
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
this law might remedy the terrible lack
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
of information that contributed to that
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
particular tragedy uh should such a
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
situation evolve in New Hampshire
 
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question again I
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
guess what I'd say is this allows
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
communication between law enforcement
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the schools to be able to do
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
something so again if the law
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement feels that there's a
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
potential threat to the schools they can
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
communicate with the school and and act
 
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:35.540 align:start position:0%
that way or vice versa if the school has
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
recognizes something they may
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
communicate with law enforcement that
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
that Communications can continue to
 
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.829 align:start position:0%
that Communications can continue to
happen

00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
um uh during the during the out until
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
they get to an outcome even though it
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
might affect the confidentiality of
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
certain information normally
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
correct so again disciplinary matters
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
occur if you're again if you're serving
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
a school board those are always
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions when you're dealing
 
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
with disciplinary actions involving a
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
student or discussion involving a
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
student those are non-public sessions
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes represent dry
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm following up on what
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Damon said the first
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph says that this is this allows
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
the exchange of information relating
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
only to acts of theft destruction or
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
violence in a safe school zone in
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
regarding now so
 
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
the discussion between the school and
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
the police when only law enforcement
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
only take place when there was something
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
that had happened at the school but the
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
information that shared could be of
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
things that have not happened in the
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
school area so again we what we don't
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
want to do is if there's a philanthropy
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
phase of History
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
um of of violence we'll use that as a
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
violent act that occurs in school and
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's a sub there's a previous act
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
that happened outside the school we
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to limit law enforcement
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
say making believe that that action that
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
occurred within the school zone was the
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
only incident that ever happened right
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's important for the school to
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on so that they
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
can take appropriate it well it it's a
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
aggravating and mitigating factors for
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
you understand what I mean by that what
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
I mean is that again if it's a single
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
incident there may be different display
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
action taken than if the student has a
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
history of violence both inside school
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's predicated by an incident in the
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
school that opened the whole that
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
started the conversation thank you
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
further further questioning from the
 
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.410 align:start position:0%
further further questioning from the
committee

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator and have a
 
00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm representative
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
Tim Horrigan from uh Stratford County
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
District 10 the town of Durham so are
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
you getting a a bipartisan bicameral uh
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
subsection of the Tim caucus uh here
 
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.770 align:start position:0%
subsection of the Tim caucus uh here
today

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.370 align:start position:0%
today
um

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I was uh I got involved in this bill
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
because uh I really like the original
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
version that uh represent Lang I mean
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
well Senator Lang introduced um in the
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
Senate and they um
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
and I think they they weakened it uh in
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
my mind they well they certainly uh made
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
it uh they certainly reduce the scope of
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
what it did I think because um
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
like the way I read the original build
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
it which is not performed but I think it
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
would have empowered schools to
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
coordinate with any law enforcement
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
official not just New Hampshire
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
officials when there's a threat to
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
student safety and that would have
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
included federal law enforcement as well
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
as other states officials um
 
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
according to other states officials as
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh useful especially in the western part
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
of the state where there is you well
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
know Mr chair there's many school
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
districts whose student bodies across
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut River then there's
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
that situation also exists on the Main
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts borders but anyway
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
what the Senate passed is very good and
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
I think it's very useful and uh thank
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
you Senator you have a good explanation
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
of why
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
why what we have is good
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
um I was a sponsors many of you some of
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
you might wear HP 78 which would have
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
overturned uh last year's HP 1178 and
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
that my mind was an overly broad bill
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
with many bad consequences the most
 
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
egregious one was that it prevented
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
local prevents local law enforcement
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
taking proactive action when an
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
individual uh well violates the federal
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
safe schools acts and probably also like
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
file you know in dangers the school
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
Community by carrying a firearm on a
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
school property with permission and
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
that's especially near the top of the
 
00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
mind at Durham because we
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh side in fact we're a college town so
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's their you know campus violence is
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
a threat that we're all worried about in
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
Durham but also we recently built a new
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
um it's a very beautiful new middle
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
school but what someone constructed like
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
a fortress with lots of uh you know with
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
lots of security features but if
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
somebody does you know get past the
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
security features with a gun they still
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
they can't really
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
do anything aside from like lock
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
everyone down and sort of like hide in
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
the classroom until such time as a
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
person decides to leave and that's uh
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
my mind not a desirable situation
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
especially in light of the you know we
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
had just another school shooting in
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
Nashville as a member of this committee
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh aptly noted
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:35.339 align:start position:0%
so this is a very timely hearing and
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
this is a vehicle certainly what we have
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
in there is good you should keep it but
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's a vehicle that could be used I'm
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
saying that it will be used but it could
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
be used for meaning meaningful school
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
safety legislation and and no I'm not
 
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
talking about doing something about side
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
doors on buildings um
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
next to that new school building I
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned most it does have a one side
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
door most of the other well most of the
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
side doors are actually like quite
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
armored so we would have been pretty
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
hard for a gunman to blow movement but
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
there is like
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
or like a couple of other side doors
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
that are not quite as art so I'm not
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
talking about eliminating side doors in
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
the school buildings I'm talking about
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
doing something about guns on school
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
campuses which uh is probably
 
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.970 align:start position:0%
campuses which uh is probably
um

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
which is anyway that's certainly
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
something that's within the community's
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
purview that would be a Germaine
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment whether or not you want to
 
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
take it up well that's up to you but
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
certainly I mean certainly what's before
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
you that's an excellent bill so you
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
certainly should at least pass that at a
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
minimum so I hope that's uh that's my
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
position that's my position Bill
 
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
position that's my position Bill
normally

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
normally
 
00:41:40.609 --> 00:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
you know normally if if this has just
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
been introduced as is um I probably
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be sitting here today because
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't have attracted my
 
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
attention as much as it would but the
 
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
original bill and I understand you know
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
why the Senate education committee the
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
Senate did what it did but I think
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
probably we should do in the house we
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
should do even more than what this bill
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
does so that's uh that's why I support
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
this and I certainly hope you might
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
consider you might want to consider some
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
amendments to it to make it even
 
00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
stronger and of course I'd be happy to
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
take any questions if anybody wants to
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
ask anything thank you very much
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you uh thank you Mr
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative what
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:20.780 align:start position:0%
um well it doesn't
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
apply directly to the legislation we're
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
um excuse me but are you bringing
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
forward any amendment that you've talked
 
00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:32.339 align:start position:0%
about several things um that could be
 
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
added to this but you're not bringing
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
forward any Amendment at this point you
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
know correct I'm not a member of this
 
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not a member of the
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee so it's
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat you know somewhat outside of uh
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
outside of my purview I'm more
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
suggesting this is something that could
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
have been done and you can also probably
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
revert back to the original bill which I
 
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.490 align:start position:0%
revert back to the original bill which I
think

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.150 align:start position:0%
think
um

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
allow much more extensive communication
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
between a wider range of law enforcement
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
officers and uh
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
and the school districts for a wider
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
range of threats you know this is pretty
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
much if I read it narrowly focused on
 
00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:10.339 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action against a student
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
who's either uh incarcerated and or
 
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.250 align:start position:0%
who's either uh incarcerated and or
being

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:15.260 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
investigated by the police for violent
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
crime and so they can be disciplined by
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
the school even I suppose actually
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
something I'm on Judiciary so we hear a
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
lot about burden of proof the burden of
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
proof for suspending is sooner from
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
school is lower than that for criminal
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
conviction so even if someone hasn't
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
been proven guilty Beyond a reasonable
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
doubt there's still you know
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence that that
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
students should not be in school so that
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
could be a useful information in some
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
cases so
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
further yes follow-up thank you
 
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.450 align:start position:0%
further yes follow-up thank you
um

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
but you can follow up on those comments
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the proposed legislation refers to
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
169 B2 Roman 14 and I think that pretty
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
well covers an existing statute that
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about serious threats to
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
school safety
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
and it outlines what those threats would
 
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:11.420 align:start position:0%
be that would
 
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.750 align:start position:0%
be that would
require

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
this communication between law
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the school are you
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there are other
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
threats that should be included in this
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where you're going with
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
your testimony actually
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
well actually what they haven't 14 it
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually include
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
assault or murder for example what
 
00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.130 align:start position:0%
assault or murder for example what
happened

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
in Nashville and that was in another
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
state of private school so everything's
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
um but like uh for example what uh the
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
person in Nashville did that the only
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
thing really that's covered there is
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief because he she he
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
destroyed the side door of the of the
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
school it doesn't really cover actually
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
carrying a firearm on campus or
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
threatening people so that's actually I
 
00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.970 align:start position:0%
threatening people so that's actually I
mean

00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
that certainly uh I mean that's those
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
are certainly that's certainly like a
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
very useful definition of the bill you
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
know but yeah I'm not I don't have any
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
specific amendments here I'm just
 
00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
suggesting the possibility in case
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
people are feeling energetic they could
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh add to the spell
 
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.349 align:start position:0%
uh add to the spell
representative

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.430 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.109 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
you're talking about limits to law
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement and not across the state and
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
whatever and I don't know whether the
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
bill the bill as it showed up to us I
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
don't know what amendments and whatever
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
but as it showed up to us it just says
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
any law enforcement officer and so am I
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
missing the
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
narrowing that you're talking about
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
well that's a
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
law enforcement so it's a little bit
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
ambiguous in my mind whether that covers
 
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.069 align:start position:0%
ambiguous in my mind whether that covers
uh

00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
whatever Vermont law enforcement or
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or making law enforcement
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
or even federal law enforcement if they
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
got involved somehow it probably
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
um so I think I'm not prepared to answer
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
that question there may be others here
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the room who might feel more
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
confident but I
 
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.370 align:start position:0%
confident but I
um

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think as I read it it
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
would you you could probably you
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
probably run into some difficulty if you
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
had to work with those other law
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies although I'm sure
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
any responsible School District would
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
would want to
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in another state or
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
at a federal level if it involved one of
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
00:46:41.819 --> 00:46:43.190 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
Belcher

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just wanted to go
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
into the testimony a little bit to make
 
00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:50.339 align:start position:0%
sure I can clarify
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
um because he testified that if a person
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
were if a person a member of the public
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
were to
 
00:46:58.329 --> 00:46:58.339 align:start position:0%
carry a gun
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
circumventing school
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
um security measures and get into a
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
school that there's really nothing that
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
can be done under current law
 
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
but would you agree that if a person's
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
circumvented school security measures
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
just some random number of the public
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
would they not be trespassing they have
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
no right to be there right
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't know but the I know the
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
school districts are very cautious
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
with the firearms on campus because uh
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
because of the Second Amendment Lobby
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
has my mind
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
um you know somewhat I guess I would
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
play some big emphasis on the issue
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concerns so I mean
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
probably there's probably something
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know there's probably something you
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
could charge them with but uh you're
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
merely having the gun without permission
 
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
there may be a case of someone's not
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
really trespassing per se they're
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
invited in but they weren't invited in
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know with the fire they bring the
 
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
firearm on campus so they can
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
because they were jumping off the topic
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
and we're way off this bill this bill is
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
very specific in terms of sharing
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
information between one agency and the
 
00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
school district yeah thank you you're
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
right yes I agree before we got to
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
remain and uh also inform folks that I'm
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
meeting tomorrow with the uh billing uh
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
Public School infrastructure that
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
involves Homeland Security and Eddie
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
Edwards from Department of Safety uh
 
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.150 align:start position:0%
Edwards from Department of Safety uh
Deputy

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
Deputy
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
um these are the type of things that
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
we're discussing over there and trying
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have safety and
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
dealing with access dealing with
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
Communications uh within our our
 
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
buildings so
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I think what we all do is stick this
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
one right where it is the sharing of
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
information so that actually you know
 
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
the school district is familiar with it
 
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.050 align:start position:0%
the school district is familiar with it
and

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so if there's not any more questions
 
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
for our representative Horrigan is there
 
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety or or
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
okay if you like to fill out a pink card
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.839 --> 00:49:18.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's confusing for many people so
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
so my name is Arana Hasbrouck and I was
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
actually a principal for Tim's children
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
when um they were when they were in high
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
school I'm currently a superintendent
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
and I approached him because of an
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
incident that had happened this fall
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
last spring in this fall
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
um we had a serious safety threat in our
 
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.829 align:start position:0%
um we had a serious safety threat in our
school

00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
involving potential of a weapon serious
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
safety threat in our school
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
when we went through the processes we
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
had our local police department
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
fortunately in this District I have a
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
police department but I do have three
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
districts and two of them do not they've
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
received coverage by the state police
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
because of the seriousness of this event
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
the state police were called in to also
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
assist us
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
when it came time to do a discipline
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
hearing with my board we were unable to
 
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
get follow-up information from the
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
police department because their attorney
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
believed that it was in violation of
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
current legislation
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
that was really frustrating because we
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
want to do the best by the student as an
 
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
individual but also as a broader scope
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the school district as a whole
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
because the safety of all of our
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
students is of utmost importance and
 
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.510 align:start position:0%
students is of utmost importance and
um

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Cody was very very supportive
 
00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
he shared what he could share but we
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
said we need to fix this if there are
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
situations that we need to know about
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
involving a school in a school matter we
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
need to know the outcome of it because
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
the only information we had was what the
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
parents wanted to share which was next
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
to nothing because they're looking to
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
advocate for their child
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
and we were told that what was being
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
shared was not accurate so I said
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
something has to happen if I'm to
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
function and Lead my boards and give the
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
best information for the safety of all
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
of our students we need accurate
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
information so I partnered with on the
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
attorney that had represented the school
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
district at that time wanted to be sure
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
that we got complete support spoke with
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education and he
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
said to be sure and speak with attorney
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
Fenton which I had done we also did a
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
wraparound and reached out to the
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety with attorney I'm
 
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
not going to get it right my digliani as
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
well as Department of Health and Human
 
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:33.770 align:start position:0%
well as Department of Health and Human
Services

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
um attorney Martinson
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
someone from there had come to also
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
speak when we went before the senate i
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate education committee and they
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
had concerns that we were looking for an
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
overreach to know all information
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
pertaining pertaining to a student
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
involved with the law enforcement and
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
that is not it at all we are just
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
concerned with matters that pertain to
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
school and school safety so that is why
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
this the second version came forward and
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
it is our belief that it does pertain to
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement because there are
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
some FBI involvement in our case as well
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
and we also our district that is right
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
around the Connecticut River on the
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
border and we have Vermont students that
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
attend our schools so reaching out with
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
many attorneys eyes this is what we
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
believed would get the intent that we
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
needed to bottom line get pertinent
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
information in our decision making
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
whether students can and can't be in
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
school and what the direct impact would
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
be on student safety
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
gives us certainly some background
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
information on it very good
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
not see any thank you very much
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
we do have someone from law enforcement
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
here as well
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
Sergeant are you have anything for us
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome do you have a pink
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
sort of like a ticket
 
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
sort of like a ticket
[Laughter]

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
staff sergeant uh Ladd from troop F uh
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
the assistant troop Commander up in Twin
 
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.069 align:start position:0%
the assistant troop Commander up in Twin
Mountain

00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
Mountain
 
00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:16.790 align:start position:0%
Mountain
um

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
as superintendent cataract said that we
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
were involved very heavily with this
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
incident in Northumberland
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and it actually became quite
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
frustrating with everything that's going
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
on in the world today especially in the
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
United States uh with school violence
 
00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the big takeaways is
 
00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:37.130 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the big takeaways is
communication

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
and we see it so often in the news
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
follow days following these incidents
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
where there's little tidbits of
 
00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:46.250 align:start position:0%
where there's little tidbits of
information

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
that people knew about but it wasn't
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
communicated or shared and when we try
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
to communicate with the school
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
we were informed uh by our attorney at
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
the department of safety uh that we
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
couldn't based on current legislation
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
and that was that was her interpretation
 
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
of that so we were very limited in what
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
we could share with the school
 
00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:08.579 align:start position:0%
pertaining to our investigation
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
in support of this this bill this will
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
allow us to communicate with these
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
schools reference uh threats of violence
 
00:54:17.339 --> 00:54:18.890 align:start position:0%
schools reference uh threats of violence
that

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
um jeopardize school safety uh or
 
00:54:22.809 --> 00:54:22.819 align:start position:0%
anything that jeopardizes school safety
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
and uh it's it's so very important
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
um in this incidence in particular uh
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
the follow-up to this uh a child tried
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
to get enrolled in a different School
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
the following year
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
that school contacted us for the police
 
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.970 align:start position:0%
that school contacted us for the police
reports

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
in doing their due diligence to make
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
sure that it's a safe environment for
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
their school and it's safe to have that
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
child come to their school we also
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't share those reports with that
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
that school district trying to take this
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
child on so I think
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that with this with this
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that those changes can be
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
made and we can share uh Communication
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
in these incidences are so very
 
00:55:07.079 --> 00:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
in these incidences are so very
important

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Myler
 
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Sergeant for being here and
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
sharing your story here the question I
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
guess I have is that how is the
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
information communicated for example
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's one thing
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
for the super for the SAU office to
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
contact you if they've got a student
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh would you would this law permit you
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
if you had a student who had been acting
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
out or had an incident or you had a
 
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:37.849 align:start position:0%
out or had an incident or you had a
record

00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
to initiate contact with the school
 
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.870 align:start position:0%
to initiate contact with the school
prior

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
to the school contacting you or is it
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
only the school district contacting you
 
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
and then you giving the information
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
I would say based on the way it's
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
a serious threat to school safety uh to
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
the reporting school officials for use
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
in disciplinary proceedings
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
um that that extra language that is
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
particularly for disciplinary
 
00:56:13.619 --> 00:56:15.730 align:start position:0%
particularly for disciplinary
proceedings

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:15.740 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph of that that law I
 
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.049 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph of that that law I
would

00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:56:21.059 --> 00:56:23.690 align:start position:0%
would
um

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
I would say that we should be able to
 
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
share that
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
um but the way that it's written
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
my interpretation solely my
 
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.770 align:start position:0%
my interpretation solely my
interpretation

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
is that it's for use in disciplinary
 
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.130 align:start position:0%
is that it's for use in disciplinary
proceedings

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
conducted in accordance with 193.13 1B
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
and two so with that language your
 
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation would be that
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
the school district could be the one
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
that would contact you if they had a
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
question not the other way around if you
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
just want to alert them correct so now
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I would say in in general practice if
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
there was a if there was a school safety
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
threat we would we could be very vague
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
about what the information that we gave
 
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:12.020 align:start position:0%
to the school where we would do things
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
away from the school that they don't
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to know about until
 
00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
they ask us yeah thank you
 
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
yes represent Lancaster and
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question uh
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
following on with what you said since it
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
says in disciplinary proceedings and a
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
superintendent calling you to say is
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
this kid okay for us to take into our
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
school a new Superintendent at a new
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
school that's not a disciplinary
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
proceeding right so
 
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
in your interpretation would you then
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
not be able to say anything we
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
my interpretation would be yes because
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's not disciplinary
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
um so yes you are correct in that thank
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome representative Damon
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for being here I
 
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
think this is a version of the same
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
question and maybe we want to hear from
 
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh Diana Fenton as well
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'm questioning whether this allows law
 
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be proactive with the
 
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.010 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be proactive with the
schools

00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
something someone you perceive as a risk
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the schools it sounds to me like it
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't is that what you just indicated
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
that would this particular legislation
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
the way it's written I would I would
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
Sergeant I I also have a question along
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
the same line when we're talking about a
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceeding then I go to the
 
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
statute and I say okay what is a serious
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
threat to school safety
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
and it specifies very specific areas
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
that you know it deals with Controlled
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
Substances weapons bodily injury
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
Etc uh so are we now walking and taking
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
this part of Statute and trying to apply
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
it to a disciplinary hearing that maybe
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
on some other topic
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's not specified under what a
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
do you do you have that statute I do
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm reading the the definition of
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
serious threat yeah yeah I'm reading
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
that right now for those that are here
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
and can you repeat your question one
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
more time please well the the question
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
is does it when we're talking in this
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill records relating to any report of a
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
serious threat to school safety
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
then we're going down on on line 13
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about of two officials for
 
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
use in disciplinary proceedings
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
um so are
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
is a disciplinary proceeding can be held
 
01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
for events which go beyond what is here
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
under the the serious threats to school
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
safety but you're only going to release
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
that information that's based upon not
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it based upon this section
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
of Roman 14 within this statutory area a
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
serious threat so it's somewhere along
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
the way you're gonna have to make the
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
decision is this related to this if it's
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
not related to that we're not going to
 
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
release the information I would agree
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
with you in that interpretation is is if
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
it fits based on the the verbiage if
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's a serious threat to school safety
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
whatever falls under as you said Roman
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
numeral uh 14.
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
where it defines serious threat to
 
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
school safety if it's not defined under
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
that I would say yes we would not be
 
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
able to release that thank you that's
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at representative
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you
 
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.109 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you
um

01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard some testimony about the
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
original language of the bill and I
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
would just point out that we're talking
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
in this what we have in front of us is
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
related for use in a disciplinary
 
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.010 align:start position:0%
related for use in a disciplinary
hearing

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:18.020 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
whereas the original Bill language was a
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
little bit different in that it said for
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
the purposes of allowing a School
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
employee to take disciplinary action
 
01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be directly related to a
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
discipline area hearing that was in
 
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
process or scheduled or something like
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
that but it would allow for I think more
 
01:01:41.339 --> 01:01:42.910 align:start position:0%
that but it would allow for I think more
communication

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
proactively which was another issue that
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
was brought up would you agree in that
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
that it would be more proactive
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
communication possibly I would agree
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
with you on that yes certainly think so
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I think we've
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
gotten off a little bit on because I
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a different reading
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
and I think a couple very brief
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
questions will steer Us in direction
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
that I think will help clarify some of
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
would you agree that it would be General
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for police to just
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
casually share this information with
 
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
school officials I would yes okay
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
knowing that
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the only real way
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
for a school to mitigate a threat a real
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
threat would be along the lines of
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
I would agree therefore
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
anytime you're going to share this
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
information in a reasonable circumstance
 
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
with school officials would it not
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
therefore be for use any disciplinary
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
proceeding yes
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
my concern is that yes I agree with what
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
that conversation but you're going to
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
release information if it's paralleled
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
by the definition that we have in 14. so
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
if the disciplinary hearing is regarding
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
another event that's not supported by
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
that you're not going to release the
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
information I would agree and it falls
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
again back to the serious threat to
 
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
school safety if there is a serious
 
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
threat to school safety I think the
 
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.289 align:start position:0%
threat to school safety I think the
purpose

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
or at least the the design purpose is to
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
be able to communicate with the schools
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
to make them aware that there is a
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
threat in their school Community that's
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
the intent that's the Insight I get that
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in I'm
 
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
not sure you're the person to answer
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
this but when we talk about school in
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
this and refer to schools in this bill
 
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
obviously we were talking about a public
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
school situation
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and you know the recent shooting was
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
in a private school
 
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:39.890 align:start position:0%
in a private school
um

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
would this apply uh to for example
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
public charter schools uh non-public
 
01:03:46.859 --> 01:03:48.049 align:start position:0%
public charter schools uh non-public
schools

01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
if it isn't mentioned in the in the bill
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
should it be mentioned in the bill uh if
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
we want that
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
uh and have have in the past have you
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'm probably not the person to
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
answer that question but I can tell you
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
the what I was speaking of earlier in my
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
testimony it was actually a charter
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
school a private charter school that was
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
looking to admit the child and I was
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
still unable to share that information
 
01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
what are the questions
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Sergeant thank you
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
you have one other comment from the
 
01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:35.569 align:start position:0%
you have one other comment from the
superintendent

01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to clarify but
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
the intent behind this is not we do have
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
that reciprocity if there's a if there's
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
a safety concern we can call the police
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
department they respond if they say you
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
need to watch this today they can
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
respond to us this is about the actual
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
release of the records in the follow-up
 
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
that happened it's not about our lack of
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
communication when there are safety
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
threats I believe that that is strong
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is about the actual records that
 
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
happened as a result we had this event
 
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
there were proceedings there were police
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
proceedings there are police
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
consequences we were unable to know what
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
they were when we went to do an
 
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
expulsion hearing children when they're
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
expelled have to be out of school for
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can't come back to our school for
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
one year unless they meet the
 
01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:21.059 align:start position:0%
specifications that were required
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
they go to seek to seek to go to a
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
charter school which and that's the
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
belief is this is just schools in
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
general that police can share
 
01:05:29.089 --> 01:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
information with schools whether it's
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
public charter Christian private any any
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
school because
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we've all seen there
 
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
aren't boundary lines drawn out for us
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
and we just need to know that
 
01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
information when we make our decisions
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
because a parent would feel that this
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't that big of a deal the school's
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
making this a much larger deal than it
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
is and we can only go off of the
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
information that the police are able to
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
as you said casually share with us but
 
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's not the specificity of yes this
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
child received this they have Juvenile
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
Detention they have this and this we
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that information which is
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
certainly relevant when we have an
 
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
expulsion hearing or we seek to do an
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
early re-entry or to extend a suspension
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that was the intent behind it it's
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
the school records we do have strong
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
relationships when there are safety we
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
all err on the side of caution giving
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
general information that is available to
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
us to the law
 
01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
thank you represent luno thank you very
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
much Mr Mr chair and thanks again for
 
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
rejoining us this morning
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
um just to refresh my memory does the um
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
does the school district have any
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
obligations to educate the child uh
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
fought during and following a a an
 
01:06:37.559 --> 01:06:40.609 align:start position:0%
fought during and following a a an
expulsion

01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
I can't quote it exactly we offer
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
services if the if the parents wanted
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
said they were homeschooled and they
 
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.109 align:start position:0%
said they were homeschooled and they
wanted

01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
um resources from us we can provide that
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
okay thank you welcome
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's a topic which we've gone into
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
very deeply as far as even other schools
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
being able to pick them up right I I
 
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:02.660 align:start position:0%
just can't remember
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
what I can say to clarify that if I if I
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
may we
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
um in the practice commonly throughout
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
the state and all the districts I've
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
been associated with would be offer ways
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
under free and appropriate public
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
education to offer as many ways for them
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
to come back to school as soon as
 
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
possible when it's deemed appropriate
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
for example we might request that they
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
they have um
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
a safety evaluation and we'll give an
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
option of through this person this
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
person this person or cross-reference it
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they do community service that they
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
meet with law enforcement that they go
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
through a diversion program so they have
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities to re-enter and just a
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up Mr chair on that yes so
 
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.289 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up Mr chair on that yes so
so

01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so districts
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
just to be clear districts do have
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
obligations to to provide uh free and
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education to students
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
um in um in uh in County
 
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.529 align:start position:0%
um in um in uh in County
um

01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
um jails
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
having having been having broken the law
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
and been found guilty yes if they're in
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
a Detention Center we'll often do um
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with them through tutoring
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
or we will provide the materials to the
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
tutors that are in those institutions
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
okay okay thanks you're welcome okay yes
 
01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:24.650 align:start position:0%
okay okay thanks you're welcome okay yes
representative

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you would comment on
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
something that keeps
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
nudging in my head
 
01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.269 align:start position:0%
nudging in my head
does

01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary proceedings of the
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process encompass
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
addressing the mental health of the
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
individual like I'm interpreting
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings as something
 
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
punitive which may well be appropriate
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
but I'm concerned about that being the
 
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.169 align:start position:0%
but I'm concerned about that being the
only

01:08:54.169 --> 01:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
approach being noted here
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
so certainly that's first and foremost
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
we always want to get to why this
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
happened to keep it from happening again
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
for this individual and for all
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
individuals so included in a re-entry
 
01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.269 align:start position:0%
individuals so included in a re-entry
plan

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
it involves ongoing therapy or making
 
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
progress in mental health and what
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
services either we can provide to the
 
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
school or outside services that the
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
family demonstrates progress that the
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
family demonstrates educational progress
 
01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:23.570 align:start position:0%
family demonstrates educational progress
Etc

01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
so those are always factors that are
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
taken it's educating the whole child
 
01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:31.070 align:start position:0%
taken it's educating the whole child
yes

01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
so that sounds like that's your District
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
standard practice
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
but I don't understand the proposed
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
this particular legislation doesn't deal
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
with an expulsion it just deals with the
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
ability to share records
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards for this
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill 109
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
not seeing how close to hearing and the
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
next scheduled hearing I believe is at
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
10 45.
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has to take a short break
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
you may do so we have about eight
 
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:49.930 align:start position:0%
you may do so we have about eight
minutes

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the school style
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
and eventually brought one to the driver
 
01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:18.500 align:start position:0%
if they did that now they'd be expelled
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
great point maybe expelled the family
 
01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:26.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
I understood
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay folks we're going to go ahead uh
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
for the next hearing here
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
for the next number yeah I got the 155s
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay the bill that's that's on the
 
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
docket next here is SB 77 it's relative
 
01:19:59.570 --> 01:19:59.580 align:start position:0%

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
students and acting on behalf of Senator
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
abar Grant bossy is here to present this
 
01:20:06.659 --> 01:20:08.390 align:start position:0%
abar Grant bossy is here to present this
bill

01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
committee I am Grant bossy Deputy Chief
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
of Staff of the New Hampshire Senate
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
here to introduce Senate Bill 77 on
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Kevin abart it's Prime
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor first I'd like to apologize for
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
Miss speaking during my introduction on
 
01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
Transportation monitors uh sorry I got
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
you off track for a second there I'm
 
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
glad Diana was here to fix it
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
our education statutes are geared
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
towards the best interests of students
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
currently RSA 1933 gives each local
 
01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:38.219 align:start position:0%
school board wide discretion in placing
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
students in other public schools public
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
academies or private schools if it
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
determines such placement is in the
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
student's best interest this is under
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
the Manifest education hardship
 
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.990 align:start position:0%
the Manifest education hardship
provision

01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
this part of Statute used to apply only
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
to private non-religious schools but the
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2021 brought state law
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
into compliance with U.S Supreme Court
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
cases that found the states may not
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
exclude religious schools from programs
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
open to other private schools however in
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
drafting this change the bill
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
inadvertently left out references to
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
private schools in 133
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
3A so it's in the beginning of the
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
statute it's not down below in the
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
statute SB 77 would make the statute
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout clarifying that
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
local school boards may play students
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
wherever is in their best interests
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
again this is the local school boards
 
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
option placement in private schools is
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
already allowed under the law such
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
placement would remain at the discretion
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
of local school boards SB 77 would have
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
no anticipated impact on state or local
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
education spending it merely cleans up
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
193.3 to make the option of private
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
school placements consistent Senator
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
abart thanks you for your consideration
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
and urges your support for Senate Bill
 
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.810 align:start position:0%
and urges your support for Senate Bill
77

01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%

thank you very much a grant
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
um obviously are you not taking any
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
questions I am minimally qualified to
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
answer questions on this bill so and
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
anything I can't answer I can get to
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
Senator ever
 
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
is there anything from the committee
 
01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
no thank you probably probably not okay
 
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
um are there any other folks that want
 
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill I only have that
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
very handy
 
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
go ahead all right thanks thank you very
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
much Diana for joining us again this
 
01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.410 align:start position:0%
much Diana for joining us again this
morning

01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
um when uh with with the with the change
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
right here
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
um adding uh approved Private School uh
 
01:22:59.209 --> 01:22:59.219 align:start position:0%
within the district or in another
 
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
District to this to this Clause does um
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
if it's an approved private school
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
that's that means approved by the local
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
school board and paid for by the 100
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
percent by the local school district
 
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:21.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure off the top of my head
 
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
because this is the this isn't um
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
this this is not a and I'll just sort of
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
for lack of better words this isn't an
 
01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
ed Choice uh provision this is Manifest
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
educational hardship so this is in in in
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
in a school districts
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation or a legal
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide a free and
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education so so no
 
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
cost should be borne by the family if if
 
01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
through manifest educational hardship
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
it's the school board's position to
 
01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
place the student in in accordance with
 
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:02.780 align:start position:0%
all that whole that whole chapter yes
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
educational hardship and best interests
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
the two are in the same 1933 yes right
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
right but that doesn't place a financial
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
obligation on the on the parents that is
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
Milo and thank you for taking my
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
question so if this is a as I recall
 
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
a school district placement
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh for the best interest of the students
 
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
and the parents were to happen to
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
disagree with that placement
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
under best interests and manifest
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
educational hardship
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's set out I think
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
more clearly in the administrative rules
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
as to what that process is and how much
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
the parents can weigh in
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
so it's a different standard for best
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
interest in manifest educational
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
hardship I speak with hesitation only
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
because the rules are not in front of me
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
but I know that that is taken into
 
01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.050 align:start position:0%
but I know that that is taken into
account

01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
so the child's not just placed at
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
another school there is Parental input
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
to that and we can go into more detail I
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
can look at those administrations thank
 
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.810 align:start position:0%
you very much
representative

01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
I was in going back to that approved
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
private school that seemed like a phrase
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
as in state approved you know the state
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
has all of those
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
what makes an approved school and all
 
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff is would that be
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
correct or that was that was my thought
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
as well when I look at that phrase I
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
think that was my hesitation with
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Luna's question is
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
approved private school is a term that I
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
would apply to the department that it's
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
been approved by the department
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you the local school district
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
might have a contract with that school
 
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
district but there there is another
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
section of law it's it's 194
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
23-b 58 page 585 in in the law book
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's under approval of high schools
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
yeah and the commissioner of the
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education made through an
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
agreement with another state when such
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
data in New Hampshire are parties to an
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
interstate agreement allow New Hampshire
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
pupils to attend schools that meet the
 
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
standards established by one of the two
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
states and but the item one underneath
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
that talks about having to attend and
 
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
approve School are approved by the State
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
Board of educations complying with
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
provisions of 19423 uh so that that's a
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's another area of Statute which you
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
know addresses the the the approval
 
01:26:52.739 --> 01:26:54.970 align:start position:0%
know addresses the the the approval
requirements

01:26:54.970 --> 01:26:54.980 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah represent cascadden
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
um I have the exact same language
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
um section uh Roman numeral two under
 
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship section d
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
reads the exact same thing including
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
approved private school within the
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
district or to a
 
01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.090 align:start position:0%
district or to a
public

01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
school or public Academy or an approved
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
private school in another District
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute yeah I'm on
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
page 507.
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
so what's different you're correct so if
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
you look at 1933 in its entirety you'll
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
see that language if you look at Roman
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
numeral one C because I hate when people
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
throw out legal citations so one C it's
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page 506 or an approved
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
private school
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
so it's there yeah it's in other areas
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
yep it's in D yep
 
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's not and as we went through and made
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
these changes
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just trying to look at the if
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
you look at the annotations or the
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
Amendments on page 509 that gives you a
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
very brief summary of the legislative
 
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
changes that were made
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
you'll see that they um trying to find
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
the year that we made them but
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
in short
 
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
when we made those initial changes to
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
add in that that phrase approved private
 
01:28:21.719 --> 01:28:23.209 align:start position:0%
add in that that phrase approved private
school

01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:24.530 align:start position:0%
school
um

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
we just didn't look as far as we should
 
01:28:30.729 --> 01:28:30.739 align:start position:0%
have down to e okay
 
01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:34.139 align:start position:0%
that's just missing language there but
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
that makes me suspicious now
 
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
as to why the school boards Association
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
and the administrators Association would
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
and maybe Jared can speak to that after
 
01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.530 align:start position:0%
and maybe Jared can speak to that after
I

01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.169 --> 01:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to speak for them not here
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
to speak from but the question I asked
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
of you earlier when we were
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
briefly back there
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we have a set of uh we have a bill SB
 
01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:09.380 align:start position:0%
266 is coming before us cleaning up 8306
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
and when I was reviewing it last night
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
on page eight it talks about private
 
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.090 align:start position:0%
on page eight it talks about private
schools

01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
and in this report
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh Ed 306 would be changed from private
 
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
schools to non-public schools so those
 
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
two terms non-public school and private
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
school are interchangeable my
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they're
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
interchangeable and we've certainly
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
within the department use them
 
01:29:35.159 --> 01:29:37.370 align:start position:0%
within the department use them
interchangeably

01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
interchangeably
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think the preferred term is non-public
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's what I've well I I get that your
 
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
these rules are basically these changes
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
are coming from the Department yes and
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
where we have private they're changing
 
01:29:54.649 --> 01:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
it to read non-public and I'm sure we'll
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
be back next year with this same bill
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
changing our terminology well this
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill's dealing with private
 
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.910 align:start position:0%
bill's dealing with private
so

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
whatever we do we better do it so we
 
01:30:10.729 --> 01:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
don't have to come back and re-change it
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
I hope this is something that the
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
department is continuously working on
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
and we've been before this legislative
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
body with issues in credentialing so
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that we as a state agency
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
are always grappling with is just trying
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with their terminology
 
01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
with our terminology and it is a
 
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.930 align:start position:0%
with our terminology and it is a
struggle

01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
struggle
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:38.030 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:43.980 align:start position:0%

01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
pink cards or like to say something here
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
in regard to this bill if not I'll close
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%

01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%

01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
public kindergarten made the comment one
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%

it had taken me eight years to get out
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
and uh comment in the background was
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
well that's now a four grade school so
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
it took you twice as long to get out as
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
you should have so there's an indication
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
of what you're dealing with folks
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
and so I do uh I do just want to take a
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
quick moment and
 
01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.450 align:start position:0%
quick moment and
um

01:31:58.450 --> 01:31:58.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
reiterate what chairman Ladd has brought
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
up that this bill is not ready for prime
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
time once again we see an indication of
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
um more work for this committee a year
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
from now as the department pointed out
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
that they'll be coming back seeking a
 
01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
different solution and so I would just
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to set aside
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation to work it
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
over make it right so that once again
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
next year we aren't having the same
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
conversation about the same issues and
 
01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
let's just get it right one time
 
01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.570 align:start position:0%
let's just get it right one time
um

01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
and that's all I'm going to say
 
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you thank you
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
for uh jumping in
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
um is your concern in that this is not
 
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:48.380 align:start position:0%
ready for Prime Time
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
concerning the use of approved private
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
school language or is there something
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
else that you think is a troubling
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
relation to the uh Bank propeller
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
question it's a little bit of both uh
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli it is the
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
language of the private school it's also
 
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
the the notion of where public money is
 
01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:09.169 align:start position:0%
the the notion of where public money is
going

01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
um to support various institutions thank
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
you for that question
 
01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.810 align:start position:0%
you for that question
representative

01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
to avoid coming back
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
if we took all of that section of Law
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
and every place where it says approved
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
private school which were adding this
 
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:32.060 align:start position:0%
into to make it consistent if we did
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
approved non-public school
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
and just added all of those in would
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
that be something that you could support
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative leckis uh it would be
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
consistent with our resolutions as they
 
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
currently stand for us to oppose this
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislation in any fashion okay thank
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
so you're not anti
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
particularly the non-profit non-public
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
school private school you're just
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
I I'm getting the concern that you're
 
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:09.980 align:start position:0%
against the Manifest education process
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
where a superintendent could decide to
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
send a child that was not fitting in the
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
situation due to all the rationale in
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
manifest education to the Montessori
 
01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
manifest education to the Montessori
School

01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
I believe what we currently have in
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
statute would allow that to happen if
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
that were a local agreement I couldn't
 
01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to that for certain but
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
I believe if that was the agreement that
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
was set up locally under current statute
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
that that could still happen
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you further questioning
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you chairman
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank God coming thanks
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
any further pink cards on this one
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
not seeing outside
 
01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.330 align:start position:0%
not seeing outside
yeah

01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
it just goes right to Alicia right there
 
01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
and it just goes around the table up
 
01:35:10.689 --> 01:35:10.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:12.980 align:start position:0%
that's my sister
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
you get push the red button
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Caden SAU 67 uh retiring
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of this year after 16 years
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
ago you may remember me uh I was here
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
testifying on this bill when you changed
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship and best
 
01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.729 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship and best
interest

01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
so I want to take you a little bit on
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
the history lesson
 
01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.110 align:start position:0%
the history lesson
um

01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
best interest in manifest educational
 
01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
hardship used to be a very good tool for
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
superintendents to deal with individual
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
issues in their school system there were
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
two separate processes best interest was
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
basically a superintendent process that
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
you could deal with the student who was
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
having difficulty in school talk to
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
another superintendent you know perhaps
 
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
there's a bullying situation perhaps it
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
was a bad breakup or something where one
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
of your students just really couldn't
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
continue in in your school needed a
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
fresh start someplace else worked out
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
with the other superintendent oftentimes
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
it was a quid pro quo no tuition changed
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
hands and so forth
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
and then manifest hardship was a
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
slightly different process where uh that
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
involved your school boards having to uh
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
to make a decision about that when you
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
rewrote the best interest in manifest uh
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
hardship rules uh the last time you
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
rewrote them you almost put them in
 
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
lockstep with each other you almost put
 
01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
them as like the best interest decision
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
and then it gets immediately appealed to
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
the school board in manifest hardship
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
I've used them a number of times over my
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
career most the biggest time I use them
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
with Dunbarton joined
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
um Bo and the students were changing
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
high schools from Goffstown High School
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
to Beau and there was about seven or
 
01:37:07.129 --> 01:37:07.139 align:start position:0%
eight students who came before us and
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
said no there's a real reason why we
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
should stay in Goffstown high school and
 
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
we worked that out with the boards now
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
this process seems to be moved a little
 
01:37:18.129 --> 01:37:18.139 align:start position:0%
bit more towards school choice
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
and I know that that's the bent of of
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
this legislature that we do on open
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
choice and we do want to open ways
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
prepare parents to have their children
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
go to different places and I understand
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
that but I'm concerned that we're moving
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know bit by bit into this is a
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle of school choice instead of what
 
01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:40.460 align:start position:0%
it was originally designed to be is for
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
superintendents to manage
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
students between Public School Systems
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
all in there
 
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
I reference Senate
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
I superintendent Cascade you can call me
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
Dean Heidi
 
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
we know each other from way back when in
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
the Hanover area tight lunch
 
01:38:06.719 --> 01:38:08.390 align:start position:0%
the Hanover area tight lunch
um

01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:09.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
proving manifests educational hardship
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
though has a lot of criteria so it's not
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
really as wide open you know as as
 
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
regular school choices and does it not
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
matter that you have to go through a lot
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
of Loops to get to a place where you
 
01:38:26.890 --> 01:38:26.900 align:start position:0%
would be able to do that
 
01:38:30.250 --> 01:38:30.260 align:start position:0%
and it should be I mean it shouldn't be
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh I just don't like my school or you
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
know I I don't like my friends that are
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
there it should be a severe case of when
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
it was where a kid really is struggling
 
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
to be in school and maybe needs a
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
different venue I just understand why we
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
have to open that up to a private school
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
I mean what why can't you just leave it
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
the way it's been a public school to
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
public school because that's taxpayer
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
money going from
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh one place to another okay follow up
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
yes all right so is there opportunity
 
01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
now to be kind of a frivolous excuse
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
rather could you speak in your mic I've
 
01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
the idea of changing school just because
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
you don't want to be in one school
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's that doesn't meet the educational
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
hardship is there a way to meet that
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for a kind of a frivolous
 
01:39:26.290 --> 01:39:26.300 align:start position:0%
excuse at this point well
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
you can always bring the case I mean you
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
can always bring the case to the
 
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
superintendent and superintendent will
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
look at it I I would tend to say uh no
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
to many cases that come to me because I
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
don't think they rise to the level of a
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
real manifest educational hardship and I
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
say no and and we move that on what's
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
the appeal of this doesn't it come to
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
the state school board so that's the
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
other thing even the local school board
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
who says okay we've gone through our
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
hearing we've made our decision then it
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you you asked
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
um what's the point of private school
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
but if I would ask you if there was a
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
child who say was Autistic or whatever
 
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
and couldn't deal with the size of your
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
school or the other local schools nearby
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
and there was a small private school
 
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
with few students who was more that was
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
what the child needed would you have
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
turned would you turn them down just
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
because it was a private school
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have that discussion in that
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
realm if it was a student with autism or
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
any other student with a disability they
 
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
would go through the special ed process
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we have the right to place any of
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
those students in a private educational
 
01:40:55.129 --> 01:40:55.139 align:start position:0%
setting that that's approved by the
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
state so special ed students do have a
 
01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
process that they can go through to be
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
placed in I would say any private school
 
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
um you know so recently we had a case
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
come through where where a student
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to be placed in a basically a
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
private school no no special ed really
 
01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
component to it and we were like no
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
you know you can't say that your
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
specialty needs are going to be met
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
better in a private school
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
because they don't have any special ed
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
programs and they don't have something
 
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
that they can meet their needs so in
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
your case you do already have a um a
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do that into the special
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
art process so follow up if
 
01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
art process so follow up if
um

01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
if the student wasn't coded say they
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
weren't autistic but they still couldn't
 
01:41:46.199 --> 01:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
weren't autistic but they still couldn't
do

01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:54.380 align:start position:0%
sorry no worries
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything still couldn't deal
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
even if they weren't coded as special
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
needs that they needed a small
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
environment maybe they were behavior
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
problems with all or whatever I don't
 
01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:07.430 align:start position:0%
problems with all or whatever I don't
know

01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
you would say well sorry you're not
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
coded you don't get to go to the smaller
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
School let's just back up a little bit
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
first of all I would mean with that
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
parents and develop a program within my
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
own school to meet their needs I mean I
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the part that you
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't understand is that schools all the
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
time are dealing with kids who have
 
01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
difficulty in school creating programs
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
creating schools within schools creating
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh special things for students and you
 
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
know at least in my experience and
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
you've got to remember Bo has resources
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
boa's resources we can do things that
 
01:42:43.450 --> 01:42:43.460 align:start position:0%
other schools can't
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
and so but what I oftentimes see in the
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
Manifest educational hardship uh cases
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
that I've dealt with is we've gone
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
through that we've made that decision
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
and really what the parents looking for
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
is a private school placement and if
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
they want a private school placement New
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is very clear they can
 
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
have one but they have to pay for it
 
01:43:04.729 --> 01:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we're way off topic
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
here uh on what this bill is about we're
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
talking about rulemaking for for the
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
Manifest education our best interest in
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
manifest education portion of Statute
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
here and when we're talking about those
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
sections all those parts are already in
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
place with this verbiage
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're just talking simply the rule
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
making Authority given by way of that
 
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
section e at the base of all the
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
Manifest education it doesn't change the
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
the requirements for best interest which
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
is based on certain needs of the student
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
which can be made locally or the
 
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
pervasive severe issues associated with
 
01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
group manifest education hardship so
 
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
let's keep it to the the topic the rule
 
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
making process yes so thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
actually just a a comment first on what
 
01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
your remarks here I've been looking at
 
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
the statute as as you are as well and
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
and you know I know we work together in
 
01:44:05.689 --> 01:44:05.699 align:start position:0%
developing this so we work with the
 
01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
school boards and the School Board
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
Association basically I'm doing this but
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an easy statute to read by
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
any by any means
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
e is um is uh also not easy to read but
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
I think what this is doing what what 77
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
is doing is actually not with respect to
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
department rules but with respect to the
 
01:44:36.129 --> 01:44:36.139 align:start position:0%
school board shall establish a policy
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
consistent with the state board's rules
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then it it reads on so it it it
 
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily say that the school
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
board I mean it's it it says the school
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
board's got to establish a policy with
 
01:44:53.209 --> 01:44:53.219 align:start position:0%
respect to uh um appropriate action
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
including assignment to another public
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
school or public Academy within the
 
01:45:01.570 --> 01:45:01.580 align:start position:0%
district or public school public Academy
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
outside of the district and I think that
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
might be falling back on what Dr
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
cascadden was um was was referring to
 
01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
when the superintendent is making a
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation because it talks about
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
that too with the recommendation of the
 
01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.270 align:start position:0%
that too with the recommendation of the
superintendent

01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
I think this is different than
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
I know we're sort of this is sort of
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
exact session talk yeah but but I just
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
sort of wanted to put it out there that
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's not about I don't think it's about
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
rules I think it's about policy and and
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd love to maybe get get uh ask
 
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
Dr cascadden for some thoughts on what
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of the what that lot not the
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
intentional about what that part of the
 
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
law is really really getting at
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
so we would have to write a policy that
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
says that we would allow a student to
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
attend a private school as part of a
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
manifest educational
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
oh the existing laws say your question
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry well so the existing law
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
says that all
 
01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
says that all
um

01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
each School Board shall establish a
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
policy consistent with the state board's
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
rules which shall allow a school board
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation of the
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent so now you're with within
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
the authority of the superintendent
 
01:46:29.410 --> 01:46:29.420 align:start position:0%
to take appropriate action including
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
assignment to another public school or
 
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
public Academy within the district or to
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
a public school or to a public Academy
 
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
in another district and and to that it
 
01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:44.060 align:start position:0%
sounds to me that that's within a
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent's Authority and in
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
working with other superintendents and
 
01:46:52.609 --> 01:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
the school board is establishing a
 
01:46:52.619 --> 01:46:54.129 align:start position:0%
the school board is establishing a
policy

01:46:54.129 --> 01:46:54.139 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'd have to go back and read I don't
 
01:46:59.209 --> 01:46:59.219 align:start position:0%
have the full uh one in front of me but
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
if going from memory the school board
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
has to approve the decision right right
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
in the day back when I was a younger
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent school board didn't have
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
to approve the decision the
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
superintendent could make that uh
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
decision and it would go and you could
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
work with he or she could work with
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
other superintendents and make that
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
happen the last time you revised this
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
the board had has to approve that
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
decision on the superintendent's
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation and what you're looking
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
at now is is opening that up Beyond you
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
know publicly funded schools to private
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
schools and I think that's outside the
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
scope of what this rule was intended to
 
01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.709 align:start position:0%
scope of what this rule was intended to
be

01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
is that outside of the scope of the
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
um I mean how how would they be able to
 
01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
set a policy involving private schools
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
well that's that I think that's the
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
point we're talking about right so I'm
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of my school board who
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
collects taxes from Beau New Hampshire
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
and saying we're going to send those to
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
a private school we're not going to send
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
those to another school in New Hampshire
 
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to send it to a private
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
school is there any quid pro quo we're
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
going to be able to have with that
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
private school I just don't see it being
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
consistent with how this statue was
 
01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
originally what it was originally meant
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
I think and that's why I brought it to
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
school we're getting way off track here
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh I believe uh uh because to get into
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
this discussion you're going to have to
 
01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
go literally through this entire process
 
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
yes when I was in the administrative
 
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
business and just like Bruce Labs was if
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
I want to talk to somebody down
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
employment man that those changes
 
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
occurred back and forth back and forth
 
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
all the time and they worked it was an
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
informal process however that's not what
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're what we are in this world today uh
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
thing things are really and it's a
 
01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
different ball game uh so I to for us to
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
start going in and looking through this
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
whole thing again uh I'm not prepared to
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I distracted you
 
01:49:08.169 --> 01:49:08.179 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
superintana cascadden thank you former
 
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
which one's my turn
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I see he is a different entity I
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
think I'd asked Diana Fenton a question
 
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
and it looked like it was just language
 
01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
that was missing but this as uh
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
represented my um Uno pointed out this
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
is pertaining to the school district
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
establishing a policy which they can't
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
as you alluded to can't make a policy
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
that says we're gonna also provide for a
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
private school education
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
whereas the other parts that include the
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
non-public or the pro the private entity
 
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
the law gives a school district latitude
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
to be able to exercise that right if the
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
only option is the Montessori School
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
within the district it's a good fit with
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
a kid
 
01:49:58.729 --> 01:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
then that school board with that
 
01:49:59.810 --> 01:49:59.820 align:start position:0%
superintendent would have that
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
discussion but I think the policy making
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
is what's
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
the way business is done but I think it
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
but I think it it provides latitude to
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
but when you're making a policy you're
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
not going to have a public policy that
 
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
alludes to you're going to play for
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
private education that's how I interpret
 
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
the two so that's why I'm questioning
 
01:50:26.689 --> 01:50:26.699 align:start position:0%
why there's even a need of this
 
01:50:26.699 --> 01:50:27.530 align:start position:0%
why there's even a need of this
um

01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:28.970 align:start position:0%
um
dispel

01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
dispel
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
because it clearly states that if
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
there's a private school and that's the
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
best solution
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
then that can happen
 
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
but I from a policy perspective I don't
 
01:50:40.609 --> 01:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
think you can write a policy that says
 
01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to send your
 
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
public money to private at this stage of
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
the game I that's why I'm looking at it
 
01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:49.450 align:start position:0%
the game I that's why I'm looking at it
yeah

01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:49.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
further discussion or not discussion
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
because we're not an exact session uh
 
01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.669 align:start position:0%
because we're not an exact session uh
questions

01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:50:55.679 --> 01:50:57.050 align:start position:0%
questions
of

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.430 align:start position:0%
of
yes

01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
so so thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
you uh superintendent cascad
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
um does um does the the district where
 
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
your superintendent currently have such
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
a policy
 
01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
you're required to have a best interest
 
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh and a manifestation manifest
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
educational hardship last time we
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
rewrote it was the last time we wrote
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
the rules so we were in compliance with
 
01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
it okay and to follow up on that
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
um and and if the school board so it was
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
so inclined
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
um uh based on the the law here the the
 
01:51:35.209 --> 01:51:35.219 align:start position:0%
law in the book not the not the bill
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
um uh the the
 
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:39.860 align:start position:0%
um that policy would have to include
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
assignment to another public school or
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
public Academy within the district or to
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
a public school or public Academy in
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
another District but if the board were
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
so inclined
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
um uh could they could they include
 
01:51:56.570 --> 01:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
um uh assignment to a non-public school
 
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
if they had moved such non-public school
 
01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:01.970 align:start position:0%
if they had moved such non-public school
and

01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I believe so I mean I'm dealing with
 
01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
Goshen Leinster right now they have
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
become basically a uh you know a
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
district of choice and school boards can
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
do pretty much what they want to do they
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
can violate their own policies and right
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
and so forth I I think you already have
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
it in there what my fear is is when you
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
put this in then a citizen saying well I
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
want to send my kid to a nice little
 
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
private school I'm going to come and I'm
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
going to and it's just that's not what
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
this was designed to be it was not
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
designed to be let's let's pick and
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
choose a school where we need to go is
 
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
designed to give School administrators a
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
chance to really deal with some issues
 
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
and so I feel I know I'm getting off
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
topic and I'm sorry that I'm distracting
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
you but I feel it's pushing a larger
 
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
agenda instead of dealing with a
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
legitimate problem thank you
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%

01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
Thirty we we open up sve 155 at 11 30 so
 
01:53:27.169 --> 01:53:27.179 align:start position:0%
that skips us about eight minutes here
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.679 --> 01:53:41.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%

is

02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate introducing Senate Bill
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
155 on behalf of its prime sponsor
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Kevin avert I will not need more
 
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
than three minutes over the past 20
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
years spending on education has grown
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
dramatically even as the number of
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire schools has
 
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
fallen administrative costs have gone up
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
faster than almost any other piece of
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
local school budgets Senator abar
 
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
believes that local voters should have
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
more direct control over the cost of
 
02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
school administration SB 155 would
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
require the annual SAU budget be a
 
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
separate Warren article from the
 
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
school's operating budget this is in
 
02:03:12.649 --> 02:03:12.659 align:start position:0%
line with New Hampshire's tradition of
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
direct democracy where voters make
 
02:03:16.729 --> 02:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
independent decisions on on various
 
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
budget proposals I just voted on my
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
School District budget on Tuesday in
 
02:03:23.209 --> 02:03:23.219 align:start position:0%
town sharing an SAU voters would
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
consider warrant articles on each Town's
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
piece of that SAU bud
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
given administrative budgets their own
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
place on the town ballot would increase
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability Senator
 
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
thanks you for your consideration and
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
ask for your support of Senate bill 155.
 
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you all right and once again if
 
02:03:43.129 --> 02:03:43.139 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I can get them to
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
center of our dancer right thank you
 
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
and we'll hold our quick do you have a
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
question for uh Mr bossy I have a
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
question for him to pass on to the
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
senator okay and my question is if that
 
02:03:58.010 --> 02:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of this and you're
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
talking about local control
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
why shall it not be amended or changed
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
in any way prior to the vote at a town
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
meeting when
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of what's supposed to
 
02:04:21.169 --> 02:04:21.179 align:start position:0%
happen at a town meeting is the town
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
weighs in on such things and makes such
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
changes as a group that they
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
see is more advantageous so that's my
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
question all right is there a particular
 
02:04:32.209 --> 02:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
line in the bill that I could reference
 
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be well it's it's 12
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
through 15 and particular line 14.
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
page two I'm sorry yes
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
I lost Senator Everton have him get an
 
02:04:46.729 --> 02:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
answer back to the committee thank you
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'd like to welcome representative
 
02:04:52.260 --> 02:05:03.129 align:start position:0%
I'd like to welcome representative
sellers

02:05:03.129 --> 02:05:03.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning
 
02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.770 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning
committee

02:05:06.770 --> 02:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:05:09.649 --> 02:05:09.659 align:start position:0%
representative sellers Grafton 18.
 
02:05:12.770 --> 02:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
I also uh was a sponsor on the the same
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
bill you actually heard earlier in the
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
year it was uh I believe it was House
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 563 and in a case we're looking at
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
155 this is almost identical to that but
 
02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
what I want to show is a couple things
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
under my belt here I have almost seven
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
years of budgeting experience three of
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
those years have been with the school so
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of how budgets work with the
 
02:05:37.609 --> 02:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
school I'm also our school district
 
02:05:40.729 --> 02:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
actually uses an sb2 type format so I
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
understand how that works as well
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh I did send you all an email last
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
night very short so you don't have to
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
read a you know more than four or five
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
lines and I hope you had a chance to
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
look at that but what I want to say on
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
this is it just gives more transparency
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
to the voters that's one of what it does
 
02:06:01.729 --> 02:06:01.739 align:start position:0%
by separating it into a separate warrant
 
02:06:01.739 --> 02:06:02.689 align:start position:0%
by separating it into a separate warrant
article

02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
article
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
looking at a budget when the people
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
actually come out to the deliberative
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
session in my case
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
they are handed a more of a summary
 
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
budget they're not handed a detailed
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
1600 line item budget
 
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
and other 1600 line items it does just
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
say Administration it doesn't show each
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
individual person's salary or how much
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
the SAU office cost Etc but there is you
 
02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
can go to the de
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
doe website and you can get that
 
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
information but most people don't really
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
know how to do that and how to get that
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
information so by putting this into a
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article would be very
 
02:06:46.570 --> 02:06:46.580 align:start position:0%
helpful and be very clear to the people
 
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
saying hey uh administrative costs is
 
02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
this uh school cost is this so now they
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
can see here you have administrative
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
cost goes up 28 percent they could say
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
whoa we don't maybe want to vote for
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
that and they have a separate warrant
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
article and they have what they call as
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
I would call it as a default budget
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
default budget is always last year's
 
02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
budget plus or minus some
 
02:07:12.169 --> 02:07:12.179 align:start position:0%
you know changes at that point but
 
02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
technically it's last year's budget so
 
02:07:16.609 --> 02:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
there will never be less than last
 
02:07:19.250 --> 02:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
year's budget all right at that point so
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
now they can actually decide do I want
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
to spend that extra 28 on just the SAU
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
portion or do I you know I'll do not and
 
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
then the school budget is the same idea
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
that uses a proposed budget and also a
 
02:07:33.649 --> 02:07:33.659 align:start position:0%
default budget as well which the voters
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
get the vote on it's pretty
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward pretty simple
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to think what else I
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
can say on this the
 
02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
I think overall it's the transparency
 
02:07:45.169 --> 02:07:45.179 align:start position:0%
and I think last time when you guys were
 
02:07:46.370 --> 02:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
talking through this and actually
 
02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
through your notes on in the calendar it
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
was stated that there is a process that
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
the school board can actually put this
 
02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
as a separate warrant article which is
 
02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:58.070 align:start position:0%
as a separate warrant article which is
true

02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
true
 
02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
but this is actually
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
let's say it's taken this out of the
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
school board's hand or out of the budget
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
committee's hands and actually putting
 
02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
it as a warrant article so it's given
 
02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
the voters a better say how their money
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
is being spent so you know having that
 
02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
option of the school board saying well
 
02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
maybe we will maybe we won't or maybe we
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
have a favorable School Board maybe you
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a favorable school board so
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
one year you'll have it on there the
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
next year you won't and I think that can
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
be very confusing to voters so I think
 
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's all I got on this any questions
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:08:37.070 --> 02:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
cordello you have your hand up thank you
 
02:08:40.070 --> 02:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for being here again
 
02:08:42.770 --> 02:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious you mentioned um the
 
02:08:44.689 --> 02:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are found on the
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
doe website
 
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure where that is but
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
um are you talking about administrative
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
costs for the individual School
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
or for these uh SAU I'm not sure what
 
02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
you refer to when you're talking about
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
administrative costs because there are
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
administrative cost specific
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
um to the school as well as business
 
02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
operations let's say for the SAU okay so
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
I I think another uh speaker will
 
02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
actually help you out on that question
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
as well but my understanding I believe
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh a12d that you can look at on the
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.169 --> 02:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
oh maybe you'll know the answer to my
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
earlier question
 
02:09:38.639 --> 02:09:39.350 align:start position:0%
earlier question
um

02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
and especially since you're an sb2 town
 
02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
which we are now
 
02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
um we can amend that
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
in deliberative session and I'm
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
wondering why it's being taken out of
 
02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh town meeting because I know when we
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
had town meeting there were times when
 
02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
the school board asked for a and we were
 
02:10:06.050 --> 02:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
not willing to give them a but we were
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
willing to give them more than the
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
default budget and we came to a
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
compromise that everybody agreed on and
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why that you've taken that
 
02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
ability out so it's now either up or
 
02:10:22.729 --> 02:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
down which you know it seems like it
 
02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
would be better for the taxpayers to be
 
02:10:27.530 --> 02:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
able to say we're not willing to give 28
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
but we're willing to give 14 percent
 
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
and everybody votes on that and it's
 
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
positive as opposed to 28 percent no so
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question for you
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
and Mike in our case we are in sb2 town
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
all right or an sb2 School Board a
 
02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:46.010 align:start position:0%
all right or an sb2 School Board a
school

02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
so you have a derivative session at that
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
deliver session you can adjust that
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
value I know we do that now so you're
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
right you can do that but when you're
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
looking at a budget at the sb2 they they
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
will go in and say I want to adjust the
 
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
budget by let's say a hundred thousand
 
02:11:05.689 --> 02:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
dollars all right what will happen is
 
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
the budget committee or the school board
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
will then go back into the budget after
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
the fact Ian decide which line items to
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
take that hundred thousand out of so
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
here it's just breaking it up into two
 
02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:19.430 align:start position:0%
here it's just breaking it up into two
pieces

02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
so you'd have either a say on the SAU
 
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
portion or you have a say on just the
 
02:11:26.689 --> 02:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
school portion that's all well you do
 
02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
have a way of mending it I got that if
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
your SP2 that's not changed in this but
 
02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
in line the same line I was talking
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
about earlier line 14 on page two where
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
it says
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
and I where it says
 
02:11:47.450 --> 02:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
um at your school board meeting that's
 
02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
people who have school board meetings
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
still and not SP2 it shall not be
 
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
amended or changed in any way prior to
 
02:11:56.689 --> 02:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
the vote and that's you're taking that
 
02:11:59.930 --> 02:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
ability to make a compromise away from
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers and I'm wondering well I
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
can understand if it's a co-op
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
and you have all these different towns
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
you don't want them doing that but they
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
it applies to single towns as well and
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why you're taking that
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
ability for a single town to come to a
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
compromise which I know our town when we
 
02:12:23.209 --> 02:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
were school when we were
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
um before sb2 we did that numerous times
 
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying and I I see I
 
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
just read what you uh were talking about
 
02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:33.229 align:start position:0%
just read what you uh were talking about
and

02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to leave that part of
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
that question up to another speaker that
 
02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:40.010 align:start position:0%
that question up to another speaker that
actually

02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:12:42.770 --> 02:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
in depth went through this and wrote
 
02:12:45.070 --> 02:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
this at this point Thank you very much
 
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that speaker will identify
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
themselves yeah we're almost there okay
 
02:12:52.490 --> 02:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I hope that's so uh
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
because 566 and this is a replicate of
 
02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:56.629 align:start position:0%
because 566 and this is a replicate of
that

02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
went down 19-1 in this committee yeah
 
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
563 I think it was yes 563 right yeah
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and you're and you're right and I
 
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
was disappointed because I I thought it
 
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
would give more clarity and and I think
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
the reason that I saw in the calendar
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
was because
 
02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:14.209 align:start position:0%
was because
um

02:13:14.209 --> 02:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
there was a way that the school board
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
could already put that on as a separate
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
warrant out of but that was optional and
 
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
if the school would wanted to do that
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh are there any other
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions because we have another eight
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
to follow or nine if I can do my modern
 
02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
math correctly here thank you very much
 
02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Winfrey
 
02:13:41.330 --> 02:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad and we have

um

02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
for the budget of the school

New London Springfield Saturn Warner and
 
02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
Wilmot and we have chosen to include the
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
seu budget as part of our district
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
budgets and the Inception of the school
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
district and dsau
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
voters have always been informed about
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
the costs of the SAU they are fully
 
02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
aware and clear about the total expenses
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
that we propose and they actively
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
execute their right to provide input
 
02:14:54.410 --> 02:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
feedback and make modifications during
 
02:14:56.410 --> 02:14:56.420 align:start position:0%
the deliberative session
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
both working with the school board and
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal budget committee
 
02:15:04.250 --> 02:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
districts are free to create as was
 
02:15:06.649 --> 02:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier warrant articles that
 
02:15:08.930 --> 02:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
are separate for any of the budget items
 
02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
they wish to bring before the
 
02:15:13.069 --> 02:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
legislative body to vote on
 
02:15:15.169 --> 02:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
those districts and seus are free to
 
02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
continue that practice with or without
 
02:15:21.530 --> 02:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
the passage of Senate bill 155.
 
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
for districts like mine that have chosen
 
02:15:26.689 --> 02:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
to include their seu expenses in the
 
02:15:27.970 --> 02:15:27.980 align:start position:0%
overall budget
 
02:15:31.370 --> 02:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
SB 155 does nothing but casts an
 
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
additional burden on the operations of
 
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
the district I do not see any
 
02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
Improvement there
 
02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:39.860 align:start position:0%
it does not help the current practice
 
02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
there's also no increase in efficiency
 
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
there's no additional transparency for
 
02:15:47.689 --> 02:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the district
 
02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
on the contrary the bill solves the
 
02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
problem it doesn't exist it forces
 
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
school board members and Municipal
 
02:15:56.689 --> 02:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
budget committee members to develop
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
three budgets instead of one
 
02:16:01.010 --> 02:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
and it does nothing to improve the
 
02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
quality of Education in kiosarch in fact
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
it does have the potential to limit and
 
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
hamper the ability to for the district
 
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
or the SEO to hire appropriate and
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
skilled Personnel to lead the
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
organization if that happens through
 
02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
retirement the relocation or taking
 
02:16:22.250 --> 02:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
other positions in other districts and
 
02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
we need to then replace those positions
 
02:16:28.129 --> 02:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
after the budgets are passed so you
 
02:16:30.169 --> 02:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
should be hopefully primarily concerned
 
02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
about finding ways to effectively and
 
02:16:34.969 --> 02:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
efficiently support education of our
 
02:16:37.490 --> 02:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire and hopefully
 
02:16:39.049 --> 02:16:39.059 align:start position:0%
not make it more cumbersome for our
 
02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
public schools to serve the public I
 
02:16:44.690 --> 02:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote against SB 155 as you
 
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
have done in the past with the House
 
02:16:47.929 --> 02:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much are there
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
questions for the superintendent
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
yes represent dry thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:16:57.049 --> 02:16:57.059 align:start position:0%
following up on what representative
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
lekas was asking when it's presented as
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
law in your budget is there an
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the voting the
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
deliberative body there to change any of
 
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
the numbers or is it just transparency
 
02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
absolutely and they have in the past uh
 
02:17:15.410 --> 02:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
we also have two budgets at the NBC the
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
municipal budget committee presents and
 
02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
the school board present in deliberative
 
02:17:20.219 --> 02:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
the school board present in deliberative
session

02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
um changes can be made we had just
 
02:17:28.849 --> 02:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
recently won uh disagreement between NBC
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
and school board over one administrative
 
02:17:34.009 --> 02:17:34.019 align:start position:0%
position that was presented it was
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
debated and in fact the lower budget was
 
02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
passed then uh in our district we are we
 
02:17:42.169 --> 02:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
are SP2 to the extent that we have our
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
own Charter so we are that would require
 
02:17:49.250 --> 02:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
us to develop the budget for the school
 
02:17:51.650 --> 02:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
board and then the
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
um the SAU budget and the default budget
 
02:17:56.810 --> 02:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
so that would I can only see it as
 
02:17:58.490 --> 02:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
additional burden on the business office
 
02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
as well as not really adding
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
transparency because it is already
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
transparent we have 1175 lines
 
02:18:08.929 --> 02:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
open to the public every time everybody
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
can inspect it and my other concern
 
02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
would be if we go down that route
 
02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:15.410 align:start position:0%
would be if we go down that route
um

02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:17.929 --> 02:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
you know what other segments do we pull
 
02:18:17.939 --> 02:18:18.830 align:start position:0%
you know what other segments do we pull
out

02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
um or be forced to be pulled out is it
 
02:18:23.209 --> 02:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
you know is it the grounds and
 
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:25.460 align:start position:0%
maintenance is it uh speech pathologist
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
is it um operating costs for books and
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
and papers so that today in my view it
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't add transparency because it's
 
02:18:37.129 --> 02:18:37.139 align:start position:0%
already there
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
further questions representative or
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:44.099 align:start position:0%
question so you have the budget with you
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
today that that stapled group is that
 
02:18:50.690 --> 02:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
available at all meetings and and uh is
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
it available in the town report school
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
report that's given out to all taxpayers
 
02:18:57.049 --> 02:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
and is it available to
 
02:19:00.169 --> 02:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
budget committee people I mean where is
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
it where is it not available I guess is
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
there any is there any way that it's
 
02:19:07.849 --> 02:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
kept from the public absolutely not
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
um any any member of the public in
 
02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
District or from anywhere else can
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
request that information it's it's
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
posted on our website it's available
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
copies are available and in fact uh
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
people from the public do come to our uh
 
02:19:26.509 --> 02:19:26.519 align:start position:0%
budget preparation meetings and can ask
 
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
and do ask many questions about specific
 
02:19:34.330 --> 02:19:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh superintendent have you tried to
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
estimate what this would cost you as a
 
02:19:41.929 --> 02:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
district in terms of additional
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
that's hard to estimate it would be uh
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
it would be an additional it would be
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
additional meeting time for NBC and
 
02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
board it would be additional time for
 
02:19:58.310 --> 02:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
the business office to separate that out
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
prepare that
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
um how to put a dollar figure with that
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
but it's it's again one of those
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
many things that you know we will do if
 
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
we are told to do that but it adds
 
02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
administrative costs there's no doubt
 
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
about it thank you
 
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%

at least just wanted to encourage the
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
members of this committee uh to take the
 
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
time to read the 23 pieces of written
 
02:20:48.050 --> 02:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
testimony that have been submitted
 
02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:49.070 align:start position:0%

online
 
02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
uh I think there is some great
 
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
information uh contained in those in
 
02:20:57.170 --> 02:20:57.180 align:start position:0%

02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
members of communities that bring out
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
some very valid points
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I sit here listening to testimony and
 
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%

administrative costs and the expense in
 
02:21:15.410 --> 02:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
school districts and then this body the
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%

greater body and the one on the other
side

02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
continue to add requirements and time
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities to local school
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
districts and then wonder why Personnel
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
costs increase and and local budgets get
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
exasperated by having to have additional
 
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:34.010 align:start position:0%
exasperated by having to have additional
people

02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:34.790 align:start position:0%
people
um

02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
this particular bill called for fiscal
 
02:21:39.770 --> 02:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
note I and forgive me if I've missed
 
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note but I haven't seen the
 
02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to review that this is a
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
local decision
 
02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh as superintendent fenneberg pointed
 
02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
uh as superintendent fenneberg pointed
out

02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:21:51.889 --> 02:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
budgets are very transparent they're
 
02:21:53.570 --> 02:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
open to the public they're detailed I
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
can remember as a superintendent
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
presenting to the budget committee a
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
budget Committee Member wanting to
 
02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
remove a tuba from our budget that's how
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
granular budgets are presented in
 
02:22:05.330 --> 02:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
communities they didn't like the fact
 
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
that we were getting a new tuba because
 
02:22:09.469 --> 02:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
we could go get a secondhand tuba and it
 
02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
cheaper so I just point that out and in
 
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
small districts and I think about Hill
 
02:22:19.849 --> 02:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
for for example uh superintendent
 
02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
principal special education director and
 
02:22:25.490 --> 02:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes food service coordinator Brian
 
02:22:28.969 --> 02:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
Corcoran who does all those things on
 
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
any given day when his when his special
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
education director resigned with two
 
02:22:36.349 --> 02:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
weeks before the school year he was a
 
02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
superintendent he was a day-to-day
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
principal he was then the super the
 
02:22:42.050 --> 02:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
special ed director and oh by the way
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
his cook was out on medical leave and so
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
he was serving peas and cucumbers so
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
those are the types of things that
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
happen in small districts it's very
 
02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
difficult to discern what is an SAU cost
 
02:22:57.290 --> 02:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
what is a building level cost and who
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
does what to pull those things apart and
 
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
then what happens in a district like
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
sau16 or SAU 48 who you'll hear from in
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit when one District says no
 
02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
how does that impact the services to
 
02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
that small District within the scope of
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
the SAU I don't need to say more you've
 
02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
heard it before you're going to hear
 
02:23:16.849 --> 02:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
some more
 
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
um but I would encourage you that this
 
02:23:22.610 --> 02:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
bill is uh inexperiod to legislate and
 
02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
please read the testimony that was
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
submitted so I don't have to come back
 
02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
and read to you thank you got six more
 
02:23:32.530 --> 02:23:32.540 align:start position:0%
seconds done
 
02:23:35.809 --> 02:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.849 --> 02:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
and we also passed out the testimony
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
both ways
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd and honorable
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um you have my
 
02:23:53.929 --> 02:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
written testimony as the chairman just
 
02:23:56.330 --> 02:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
indicated so my comments today will be
 
02:23:58.610 --> 02:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
brief as the chairman said my name is
 
02:24:00.349 --> 02:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
Daniel Rosner I'm the business
 
02:24:02.570 --> 02:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
administrator for SAU 48 which is
 
02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
arguably the most complex SAU in the
 
02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
state we have seven we have excuse me
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
nine independent school districts seven
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
follow traditional meeting two are sb2
 
02:24:14.270 --> 02:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
um my point I'm also happened to be the
 
02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
moderator of the town in which I reside
 
02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
not a school district moderator but I am
 
02:24:19.730 --> 02:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
the town moderator
 
02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:20.510 align:start position:0%
the town moderator
um

02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
my position is that the legislation
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's currently in place relevant to
 
02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
the subject of SAU budgets is
 
02:24:27.770 --> 02:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
satisfactory there's a base process
 
02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's an alternative process and
 
02:24:32.270 --> 02:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's enough
 
02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:32.990 align:start position:0%
that's enough
um

02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:35.809 --> 02:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
I believe a part of the history of this
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
proposal comes stems from a failed local
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
proposal and that doesn't necessarily in
 
02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
my mind mean it should be translated to
 
02:24:44.770 --> 02:24:44.780 align:start position:0%
a Statewide mandate
 
02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
local control is a vast and important
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
part of New Hampshire history
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
I will say that multi-district saus are
 
02:24:54.170 --> 02:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
particularly complex
 
02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
and that Community especially in the
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
sau's I've been affiliated with our
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
Communications with our communities is
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
wide open we have for the development of
 
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
the SAU budget and Adoption of the SAU
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
budget we have multiple public hearings
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
that are duly noticed advertised in
 
02:25:12.410 --> 02:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
local papers and open for input from the
 
02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:13.610 align:start position:0%
local papers and open for input from the
public

02:25:13.610 --> 02:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
prior to the adoption of our annual
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
budget the officials that are elected to
 
02:25:19.969 --> 02:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
oversee our school districts and their
 
02:25:24.050 --> 02:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
finances in SAU 48 we have 47 school
 
02:25:25.610 --> 02:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
board members in total across the nine
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
independent school districts they are
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
all members of the SAU board that
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
approves this said budget
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
much like the state legislature voters
 
02:25:36.770 --> 02:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
have a remedy for dissatisfaction when
 
02:25:40.010 --> 02:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
or if it exists I can't imagine that
 
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
once you and the Senate work so hard to
 
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
approve a state budget if you would then
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
put it up back out to a local vote how
 
02:25:47.809 --> 02:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
frustrating or time-consuming or
 
02:25:49.969 --> 02:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
inefficient that would be
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
furthermore as a moderator as I've said
 
02:25:54.290 --> 02:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
with the process that's called for in
 
02:25:56.929 --> 02:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
this contemplated legislation I believe
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
the sanctity security and Clarity of
 
02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
elections in New Hampshire uh what is a
 
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
nationwide model currently this
 
02:26:06.530 --> 02:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
legislative legislation threatens to
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
impute that with the transference of
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
ballots and movement of ballots if you
 
02:26:15.050 --> 02:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
have nine districts voting separately
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
and the ballots on this one article
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
would have to move around across the SAU
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
and then be counted in the final night
 
02:26:23.570 --> 02:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
which is what this legislation calls for
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's untenable
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's the end of my testimony thank you
 
02:26:29.690 --> 02:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
for your time very much are there
 
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:32.540 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Rosner yes
 
02:26:34.610 --> 02:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative drawing thank you Mr
 
02:26:35.809 --> 02:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:26:35.819 --> 02:26:36.889 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:26:36.889 --> 02:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
um appreciating that this is a mandate
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
because it says shall would it change
 
02:26:43.969 --> 02:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
anything for you if it changed to a May
 
02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
and was able to be done in smaller
 
02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
districts that are less complicated
 
02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:50.090 align:start position:0%
districts that are less complicated
um

02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
I think so it's an interesting thank you
 
02:26:54.889 --> 02:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
for your question I'm not that I'm uh
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
qualified to interpret it but I will say
 
02:26:58.849 --> 02:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
that I believe the current legislation
 
02:27:01.610 --> 02:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
in RSA 194
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
provides the alternative process that
 
02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
you speak what if it becomes a may it
 
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
becomes an alternative process that
 
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
could be adopted and I think that
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
already exists which renders the change
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
the change would render the proposed
 
02:27:13.319 --> 02:27:14.710 align:start position:0%
the change would render the proposed
legislation

02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
even more unnecessary that I believe
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh could you explain to me what are the
 
02:27:26.650 --> 02:27:26.660 align:start position:0%
districts in pemmy Baker sure we have
 
02:27:29.150 --> 02:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
Romney well no we have nine independent
 
02:27:30.889 --> 02:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
school districts okay and I can list
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
them off for you would you please sure
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
Camden yeah which operates a K-8 yeah
 
02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
Ellsworth which is a tiny little
 
02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
District doesn't operator school
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
tuitions it's students
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
to various districts within the SAU
 
02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:45.170 align:start position:0%
to various districts within the SAU
holderness

02:27:45.170 --> 02:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
holderness
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
Plymouth also a K-8 holderness to
 
02:27:50.210 --> 02:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
Plymouth rumney Thornton Waterville
 
02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
Valley and Wentworth they're all
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
independent school districts that
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
operate a K-8 school and we have the
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
penny Penny Baker Regional School
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
District which is our Cooperative High
 
02:28:01.969 --> 02:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
School which has seven member towns
 
02:28:03.770 --> 02:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in my written testimony
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
one of the member towns of our seven
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
Town Cooperative is Ashland
 
02:28:10.490 --> 02:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
which is particularly complex because
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
the Ashland School District which is a
 
02:28:16.490 --> 02:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
K-8 is a member of sau2 Interlakes
 
02:28:18.650 --> 02:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
but the town of Ashland is a member of
 
02:28:20.090 --> 02:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
the pemi baker Regional School District
 
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
which is Plymouth Regional High School
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
which is part of SAU 48.
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
so this notion of the it gets it gets
 
02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:30.190 align:start position:0%
so this notion of the it gets it gets
wild

02:28:30.190 --> 02:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
wild
 
02:28:34.490 --> 02:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
it makes the multi-district issue for
 
02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
single first multi-district SAU is
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
particularly complex as this is
 
02:28:41.090 --> 02:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
contemplated well that's huge Waterville
 
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
to Ashland all the way over to Wentworth
 
02:28:44.929 --> 02:28:44.939 align:start position:0%
we're the largest so we have the most
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
independent school districts of NES even
 
02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
the state we're also the largest
 
02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
geographical area I mean on a day when I
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
go from the Largo Valley Elementary
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
School to Wentworth I'm driving 45 miles
 
02:28:56.330 --> 02:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
one way yeah and and that's fine
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
um but there are so many different ways
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
in which
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
as they use are con are constructed you
 
02:29:04.730 --> 02:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
know whether it be my first assignment
 
02:29:07.250 --> 02:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
as a ba was was uh with a Mr sellers
 
02:29:10.130 --> 02:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
Community as as newfounds ba which was a
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
seven Town single Cooperative District
 
02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
which is somewhat equivalent to our high
 
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
school in terms of political structure
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
but then we've got these other districts
 
02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
but that's one SAU one district and I
 
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
would argue that
 
02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
yes you know when David sod for former
 
02:29:26.690 --> 02:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
president of right to know New Hampshire
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
testified before the house a couple of
 
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
years ago he held up our SAU spoke to us
 
02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
he was a resident within our community
 
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
and he spoke about the transparency that
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
held us up as a model because there's
 
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
only one piece of confidential
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
information in in our in our view and
 
02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's the individual health care
 
02:29:44.929 --> 02:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
choices of an employee which is why we
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
aggregate the health care experience
 
02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
not what the cost per plan is but the
 
02:29:50.929 --> 02:29:50.939 align:start position:0%
individual person's choice but a
 
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
person's employment contract and every
 
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
other piece of information we have is
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
always available if someone calls our
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
office and asks for a copy of my
 
02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
personal Employment contract to be
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
emailed to them so they can review it
 
02:30:04.130 --> 02:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
02:30:06.050 --> 02:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know it's all open to the public
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
with the exception of personal health
 
02:30:09.650 --> 02:30:09.660 align:start position:0%
care choices
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
so I would argue that transparency
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
exists and public input is taken and the
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
large number of elected board members we
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to build and adopt a budget in a
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
public process
 
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
more than handles the concerns that
 
02:30:26.330 --> 02:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
people may have
 
02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
not see any other hands thank you very
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your time yes
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:01.130 --> 02:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
good morning good afternoon that's your
 
02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
wish but close enough thank you very
 
02:31:06.050 --> 02:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
much my name is Paul deschane I'm a
 
02:31:08.809 --> 02:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
problem a project manager with the town
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
of Newington and I've been asked on
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board of selectman of
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
knowington to appear before you to speak
 
02:31:18.170 --> 02:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
about Senate Bill 155 although I'm not
 
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to necessarily answer any
 
02:31:22.730 --> 02:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
questions relative to the bill as
 
02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
presented I am suggesting or at the
 
02:31:27.650 --> 02:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board to contemplate an
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
amendment in that amendment is on the
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
backside of the material I just sent you
 
02:31:35.929 --> 02:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
also should have received this via email
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh the town of Newington finds itself in
 
02:31:41.330 --> 02:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
a perplexion situation
 
02:31:44.809 --> 02:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the SAU seu 50 by which
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
it belongs and
 
02:31:49.130 --> 02:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
um that part
 
02:31:49.140 --> 02:31:50.530 align:start position:0%
um that part
um

02:31:50.530 --> 02:31:50.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
perplexing point is that uh as we
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand the statute has drafted
 
02:31:58.370 --> 02:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
currently we're not permitted to talk
 
02:32:02.090 --> 02:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
about necessarily changing uh with our
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
memory communities and as participants
 
02:32:07.210 --> 02:32:07.220 align:start position:0%
the methodology by which we fund our SAU
 
02:32:10.030 --> 02:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
there is a process under RSA
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
94c2 that speaks to creating a planning
 
02:32:14.809 --> 02:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
committee and that planning committee is
 
02:32:16.929 --> 02:32:16.939 align:start position:0%
authorized to discuss a reorganization
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
of the SAU or draws establishments
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
operations constructions the facilities
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
and then possibly curricula but it does
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
not permit the discussion of funding and
 
02:32:31.250 --> 02:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
the reason being is because of the
 
02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:32.570 align:start position:0%
the reason being is because of the
statute

02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
statute
um

02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
that's being contemplated being amended
 
02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:36.670 align:start position:0%
that's being contemplated being amended
today

02:32:36.670 --> 02:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:32:40.690 --> 02:32:40.700 align:start position:0%
94c9 2
 
02:32:44.450 --> 02:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
prescribes that the method by which saus
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
are funded is half on the membership's
 
02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
attendance and half on the assessed
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
value of the member of communities
 
02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
that's it it's at the top down
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
definitive statement
 
02:32:58.610 --> 02:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
um the town of Newington would like to
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
enter a conversation with our member
 
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
communities about alternate means of
 
02:33:05.570 --> 02:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
funding that so hence the red line uh
 
02:33:08.809 --> 02:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
sentence or phrase we're proposing to
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
add uh to to the bill if you are so
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
inclined I would note that if you look
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the Cooperative School District
 
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
statute 195 7 subsection 1C
 
02:33:25.309 --> 02:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
there is a language of this some other
 
02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
formula offered by The Cooperative
 
02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
school district school board with the
 
02:33:30.650 --> 02:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
board's recommendation adopted by the
 
02:33:32.450 --> 02:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
Corpus school district and approved by
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education so
 
02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
Department of school districts have that
 
02:33:35.399 --> 02:33:36.410 align:start position:0%
Department of school districts have that
ability

02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
but for some reason saus do not we're
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
locked into this one half one half
 
02:33:44.330 --> 02:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism now why is that
 
02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
important um
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
many communities feel unjustly uh harmed
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
by this that edict in the statute in
 
02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
newington's case 36 percent of our
 
02:33:58.929 --> 02:33:58.939 align:start position:0%
assessed value is in utilities
 
02:34:01.849 --> 02:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
utility is already paying the full boat
 
02:34:05.809 --> 02:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
of the Statewide education tax the 6.60
 
02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
cents originally done over 10 years ago
 
02:34:12.170 --> 02:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh as compared to the 1.27 that the rest
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
of the community uh pays so there
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
their harm is is Amplified because not
 
02:34:22.010 --> 02:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
only do they have to pay the 660. but
 
02:34:23.809 --> 02:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
now because Newington has a higher
 
02:34:26.510 --> 02:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation than many of its SAU members
 
02:34:28.610 --> 02:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
it has a disproportional share of the
 
02:34:31.070 --> 02:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
cost in supporting SAU so we would like
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
to have at least the ability to discuss
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
with our members that unfairness and to
 
02:34:37.010 --> 02:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
see if there's a way to resolve it I'll
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
leave it at that thank you very much are
 
02:34:41.690 --> 02:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the House
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
Education committee my name is Eric
 
02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
power I'm the president of the school

02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk to you a little bit
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
about sau's so
 
02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
um just for clarity there are 81 single
 
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
District saus in New Hampshire and 24
 
02:35:15.770 --> 02:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
multi-districts you heard the examples
 
02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
of both of them today every single SAU
 
02:35:21.490 --> 02:35:21.500 align:start position:0%
has to file what they call this form
 
02:35:24.770 --> 02:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
a12d central office Personnel that
 
02:35:27.290 --> 02:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
identifies who's in their SAU no matter
 
02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
what kind of SAU you are that has to go
 
02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education it talks
 
02:35:33.230 --> 02:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
about full-time equivalence so stay so
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
everybody has to do this already
 
02:35:37.490 --> 02:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh in a single District SAU the
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
budgeting process is a little bit
 
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
different than a multi-district in a
 
02:35:41.690 --> 02:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
single District SAU
 
02:35:44.210 --> 02:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
they it's kind of like they can do
 
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
whatever they want because they they
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
basically their SAU budget is part of
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
their operating budget I've not seen an
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
example in a single District Su where
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
they break out
 
02:35:55.370 --> 02:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
that is a separate award article
 
02:35:57.530 --> 02:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
um and it varies greatly in a review of
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
about a dozen of these single district
 
02:36:01.610 --> 02:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
saus there were some that cleanly broke
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
out SAU costs but many about three
 
02:36:06.530 --> 02:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
quarters did not they rolled salaries
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
into with all the rest of the salaries
 
02:36:09.770 --> 02:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
of old benefits and other things so you
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't actually tell and they used
 
02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
different examples I have it in the
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that you have different
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
categories that I that were found in the
 
02:36:17.100 --> 02:36:18.170 align:start position:0%
categories that I that were found in the
review

02:36:18.170 --> 02:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
review
 
02:36:20.809 --> 02:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
so in some in many cases it's not clear
 
02:36:22.370 --> 02:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
how much is being spent on the SAU
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
office in multi-district sau's they have
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
to figure out how much is in the seu
 
02:36:28.910 --> 02:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
it's by law because they have to
 
02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:30.250 align:start position:0%
it's by law because they have to
apportion

02:36:30.250 --> 02:36:30.260 align:start position:0%
apportion
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
the expenses across the SAU so they
 
02:36:35.809 --> 02:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
already know so the multi District sau's
 
02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
already are doing this
 
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
they have to do a process to set the SAU
 
02:36:42.889 --> 02:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
budget it starts in the fall they have
 
02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
to set a budget in December they have a
 
02:36:48.650 --> 02:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
hearing and then the SAU board approves
 
02:36:50.809 --> 02:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
it and you can't change it after that so
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
that's what happens in a multi-district
 
02:36:52.439 --> 02:36:53.389 align:start position:0%
that's what happens in a multi-district
SAU

02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
if you've adopted this alternative
 
02:37:00.770 --> 02:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
budget procedure 194 c9b you can have a
 
02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
what they call an adjusted budget
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
similar to a default budget it's
 
02:37:06.889 --> 02:37:06.899 align:start position:0%
um if they're if they don't have adopted
 
02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
that then it just becomes a district
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
the alternative budget procedure is
 
02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
available but it's only available to the
 
02:37:20.570 --> 02:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
24 multi-district sau's for one thing
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
and currently it's only been adopted by
 
02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
three that's currently in effect
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
um but what it does do is it provides a
 
02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
choice between a proposed SAU budget and
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
a Def and an adjusted budget for all the
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
voters so all the voters in each of the
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
district meetings whether it's sb2 or
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
traditional vote on this and then the
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
the each is as each meeting happens the
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
the uh results are announced and then
 
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
they're tallied at the end
 
02:37:49.490 --> 02:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
majority wins
 
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
if the majority chooses the proposed
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
budget you get the proposed budget if it
 
02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't you get the default budget
 
02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to adopt this alternative
 
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
budget procedure because you have to
 
02:38:03.650 --> 02:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
have typically it comes from citizens so
 
02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
it's a Citizens petition warrant article
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
in every District
 
02:38:09.790 --> 02:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
and they um
 
02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's easier for a school board to
 
02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
um we've already heard about current
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
education spending Trends I'll skip that
 
02:38:23.230 --> 02:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
but the idea here is that
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
requiring budget the budget and
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
balloting procedure to be used for all
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
school districts really ensures that all
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
school districts and especially single
 
02:38:33.170 --> 02:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
District sau's make it clear to the
 
02:38:35.809 --> 02:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
voters how much they're spending
 
02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
and that gives voters a choice
 
02:38:41.929 --> 02:38:41.939 align:start position:0%
they uh there there was talk about extra
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
efforts yes there's a little bit of
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
extra effort but you already know who's
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
in your SAU because you have to file
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
that form with the Department of
 
02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:49.309 align:start position:0%
that form with the Department of
Education

02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
Education
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
so the multi-districts are already doing
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
this the 24 doing 81 aren't
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
so by providing this this budget process
 
02:39:01.849 --> 02:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
to all sau's it's going to be more uh
 
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
transparent it's going to give voters in
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
a choice when they have the ballot vote
 
02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
at their district meeting and when
 
02:39:12.410 --> 02:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
there's more scrutiny on the budget you
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
tend to have more responsible and
 
02:39:15.889 --> 02:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
sustainable budgets
 
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
and I also mentioned I'm in it's one of
 
02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
the school districts that has this
 
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
alternative budget procedure so I can
 
02:39:22.849 --> 02:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
speak to it in detail if anybody has any
 
02:39:22.859 --> 02:39:23.870 align:start position:0%
speak to it in detail if anybody has any
questions

02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
so I'd recommend that the house
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
education committee take a look at this
 
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.070 align:start position:0%
education committee take a look at this
bill

02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:39:31.010 --> 02:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
read the testimony I'd also mention some
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
of the testimony that's online talks
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
from single District saus they talk
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
about how they can't separate the costs
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
but the the multi-districts are already
 
02:39:41.809 --> 02:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
doing this so there's a little bit of
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
discontinuity there
 
02:39:46.849 --> 02:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
so I would recommend OTP and SB 155 and
 
02:39:48.770 --> 02:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions thank
 
02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
02:39:52.250 --> 02:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Tanner
 
02:39:53.809 --> 02:39:53.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:56.030 --> 02:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I when you started out you said
 
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
you're you're president of the I believe
 
02:39:59.929 --> 02:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
the school district governance
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire could you
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
and and are you a lobbyist for them and
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh could you just explain a little bit
 
02:40:07.319 --> 02:40:08.809 align:start position:0%
uh could you just explain a little bit
about

02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
who they represent
 
02:40:11.809 --> 02:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
so the school district government
 
02:40:14.990 --> 02:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
Association is a non-profit New
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire non-profit group nobody is
 
02:40:19.790 --> 02:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
paid we're all volunteers so we're not
 
02:40:22.010 --> 02:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
lobbyists if we're not paid
 
02:40:26.210 --> 02:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
um there's there's 50 uh 55 to 60
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
members across the state
 
02:40:31.370 --> 02:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
former school board members and former
 
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
budget committee members or current
 
02:40:36.650 --> 02:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
school and budget committee members
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
including about uh 15 or 16 state

thank you it's it's my understanding
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
that being paid or not paid is not uh
 
02:40:57.410 --> 02:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
criteria for uh
 
02:40:59.690 --> 02:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
difference between the lobbyist and a
 
02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:01.620 align:start position:0%

you wearing an orange badge
 
02:41:14.929 --> 02:41:14.939 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are people that are paid
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%

so and follow up on that so I I is is
 
02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:24.720 align:start position:0%

public that might want to know if
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's a question regarding that that
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
can be taken up after the meeting okay
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
or with the Secretary of State's office
 
02:41:37.250 --> 02:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
that wherever you choose to go that's
 
02:41:39.410 --> 02:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
correct but let's stick to the bill okay

multi-district

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
multi-district
 
02:42:14.929 --> 02:42:14.939 align:start position:0%
um when I heard about this bill and then
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
I read through it as somebody who has to
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
deal with this day to day you asked
 
02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
before what are the financial impacts
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
what are the administrative impacts I'm
 
02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
here for any questions you may have but
 
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
I will share with you that I interpret
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
this text and I have to apply it each
 
02:42:34.730 --> 02:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
and every day every single law and this
 
02:42:37.250 --> 02:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
particular change of legislation is
 
02:42:39.410 --> 02:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
extremely confusing
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
um to me so I'm going to clarify for a
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
few things
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
um one it talks about a default type
 
02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:49.250 align:start position:0%
um one it talks about a default type
budget

02:42:49.250 --> 02:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
not really defined or contracts ensuing
 
02:42:55.309 --> 02:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
and that is on let me see whatever page
 
02:42:56.809 --> 02:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to get the page that was
 
02:42:59.929 --> 02:42:59.939 align:start position:0%
well the dra helps determine what's in
 
02:43:01.309 --> 02:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
the default there are statutes that
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
determine what's in the default
 
02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
currently on a school district
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
um if it's a contract that has to be
 
02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislative body not
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
just simply by a contract that I have
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
but this is unclear what I have
 
02:43:15.290 --> 02:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
contracts with each and every secretary
 
02:43:17.809 --> 02:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
in the SAU assistant superintendent
 
02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
facilities director you name it so that
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
would be part of a default going forward
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know does a contract
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
with a fuel company for two years
 
02:43:28.130 --> 02:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
constitute a contract don't know and
 
02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
it's a somewhat ambiguous so you're
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
asking me as the business administrator
 
02:43:36.889 --> 02:43:36.899 align:start position:0%
to uphold the laws that you create but
 
02:43:39.650 --> 02:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
there's just not a whole lot of clarity
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
um in my role there's a lot of gray
 
02:43:44.690 --> 02:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
in this particular statute and I the
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman behind me had mentioned about
 
02:43:50.570 --> 02:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
one half ADM one app equalized assessed
 
02:43:52.010 --> 02:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
valuation well that's kind of easy so
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
when I do the approp the uh the
 
02:43:56.210 --> 02:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
allocation of expenses I can follow a
 
02:43:59.450 --> 02:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
formula pretty simple on this one not so
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
simple and a lot of it is subject to
 
02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
interpretation my interpretation and
 
02:44:06.290 --> 02:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
every other business administrator in
 
02:44:08.690 --> 02:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so that's uh
 
02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
again very very complicated I don't know
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
if the Department of Revenue has been
 
02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
involved in this I have to post all of
 
02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.370 align:start position:0%
involved in this I have to post all of
my

02:44:16.370 --> 02:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:44:18.650 --> 02:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
um forms on the dra website is this
 
02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
going to be on that or are they have
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
they been consulted on this bill I don't
 
02:44:24.770 --> 02:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if the New Hampshire
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
education department has been involved
 
02:44:28.730 --> 02:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
in this there are legal consequences of
 
02:44:32.330 --> 02:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
this you look at the um issue of ballots
 
02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
and that's my second one so I am in also
 
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
an election official in Goffstown just
 
02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
did that two nights ago it was up until
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
one in the morning
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
and what I can tell you is that this is
 
02:44:45.290 --> 02:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
also really problematic
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't I can't even determine if I'm
 
02:44:50.030 --> 02:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
reading it twice whether or not is it
 
02:44:51.889 --> 02:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
the majority of votes in each individual
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
town have to pass in both towns or is it
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
the majority of all towns
 
02:44:58.250 --> 02:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
um in the statute it talks about a
 
02:45:00.650 --> 02:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
weighted vote for sau's
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
um for the SAU board so in my community
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
Goffstown pays 78 percent of the
 
02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation New Boston pays 22 if
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
there was ever an issue they could take
 
02:45:12.530 --> 02:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
a weighted vote I can't recall the last
 
02:45:13.849 --> 02:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
time they've done that except for maybe
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
20 years ago does the same weighted vote
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
principle apply here in the in the
 
02:45:21.530 --> 02:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
election because arguably Goffstown is
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
paying 78 percent of the freight but yet
 
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
if half the voters if the voters in say
 
02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
New Boston decide that they're not in
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
favor of it is that fair
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't know ambiguous
 
02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
um so I think this is another one of
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
these bills quite honestly that is just
 
02:45:40.429 --> 02:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
really needs a whole lot more work
 
02:45:40.439 --> 02:45:42.050 align:start position:0%
really needs a whole lot more work
respectfully

02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
02:45:43.969 --> 02:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
um and I think in hearing all the
 
02:45:46.730 --> 02:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
testimony sometimes working groups are
 
02:45:48.110 --> 02:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
better if you're if you're looking for
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
transparency maybe there's other ways of
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
doing that you'll want more local
 
02:45:53.330 --> 02:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
control maybe other ways of doing this
 
02:45:56.929 --> 02:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
but I would respectfully ask that
 
02:45:59.809 --> 02:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
um that you take a pass on this bill and
 
02:46:02.330 --> 02:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
um not not approve it so thank you very
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much are there
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
now see you thank you very much thank
 
02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:08.750 align:start position:0%

02:46:22.969 --> 02:46:22.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me back I'll try
 
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
to behave better this time
 
02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:28.190 align:start position:0%
to behave better this time
um

02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
yeah oh man it must be in the gene pool
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
huh oh yeah we're trouble we're trouble
 
02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
um we are a uh I worked in a
 
02:46:39.170 --> 02:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
Newfoundland I've worked at NSC 36 both
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
Cooperative boards uh and uh when I
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
first started working at boat we were a
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
single district and we brought on
 
02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:46.190 align:start position:0%
single district and we brought on
Dunbarton

02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton
 
02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
sort of former SAU budget in November we
 
02:46:52.370 --> 02:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
have an SAU meeting where we propose
 
02:46:55.250 --> 02:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
that budget anyone can come to that
 
02:46:58.130 --> 02:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
meeting the SAU board is composed of the
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
full members of the Dunbarton and
 
02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
billboard so that's 10 members and we
 
02:47:04.849 --> 02:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
sit and we go over the budget there is
 
02:47:07.370 --> 02:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
very little money in that budget you
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
know people keep asking me hey Dr Kevin
 
02:47:11.270 --> 02:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
you buy this for me I don't have any
 
02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:12.349 align:start position:0%
you buy this for me I don't have any
money

02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:47:14.929 --> 02:47:14.939 align:start position:0%
we have a 36 million dollar budget
 
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
between dunbart and Bo the SAU is 1.3
 
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
million it supports seven people
 
02:47:22.849 --> 02:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
the superintendent the business
 
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
administrator the special ed director
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
the curriculum director
 
02:47:29.690 --> 02:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
Rose who comes in on Wednesdays does all
 
02:47:32.690 --> 02:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
our books and and two secretaries that's
 
02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:33.530 align:start position:0%
our books and and two secretaries that's
it

02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
we're in the high school so we don't put
 
02:47:36.889 --> 02:47:36.899 align:start position:0%
we don't have any building costs or
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
anything like that and you know you're
 
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
talking and we're we're a regular town
 
02:47:43.969 --> 02:47:43.979 align:start position:0%
meeting in both districts we don't do
 
02:47:46.610 --> 02:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
default budgets and and you're taking an
 
02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:48.550 align:start position:0%
default budgets and and you're taking an
alternative

02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
methodology and saying everyone's got to
 
02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
do the alternative methodology why if
 
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
you want to do this methodology you can
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
adopt it and you can go forward with it
 
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
on a larger scale you know I like
 
02:48:02.809 --> 02:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
talking about larger scales you're all
 
02:48:02.819 --> 02:48:04.670 align:start position:0%
talking about larger scales you're all
Representatives

02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
you've been duly elected and people
 
02:48:08.809 --> 02:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
trust you to make good decisions
 
02:48:10.510 --> 02:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's the same as a school board
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're duly elected they're trusted to
 
02:48:15.230 --> 02:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
make good decisions if you don't like
 
02:48:17.349 --> 02:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
the decision your school board is making
 
02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
vote them out the next time you have an
 
02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:20.990 align:start position:0%
vote them out the next time you have an
election

02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
the idea that the only way that we can
 
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
control costs is to put it out or for
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
direct democracy goes against what this
 
02:48:29.809 --> 02:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
country is founded on we're not a direct
 
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
democracy we're a representative
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
Republic I think I got that right I
 
02:48:35.929 --> 02:48:35.939 align:start position:0%
wasn't a history major but we're
 
02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative and if you don't like the
 
02:48:39.650 --> 02:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
decisions that are being made in your
 
02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
local school board then vote them out
 
02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
and get someone else in there so we have
 
02:48:45.410 --> 02:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
that that 10-member meeting in November
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
we propose the budget uh it's put out on
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
our website you don't even have to find
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
it it's right there you can go through
 
02:48:54.410 --> 02:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
it pretty transpire we got seven people
 
02:48:55.910 --> 02:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
put their names on everything that
 
02:48:58.670 --> 02:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
happens and then we adopt the budget in
 
02:49:01.309 --> 02:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
December usually with very few changes
 
02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then we apportion it out to the two
 
02:49:05.210 --> 02:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
districts and we start talking about the
 
02:49:07.730 --> 02:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
36 million so let's talk about this
 
02:49:10.490 --> 02:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
concept of default year to year
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
one employee changes in my office and
 
02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
goes from a wave Insurance to a family
 
02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
insurance that's about a twenty thousand
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
dollar change
 
02:49:23.210 --> 02:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
I don't have twenty thousand dollars to
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
find in our budget because we have
 
02:49:28.429 --> 02:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
contracts with everyone else there and
 
02:49:30.770 --> 02:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
so we have to be very careful about that
 
02:49:32.270 --> 02:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
sort of thing the way we budget we're
 
02:49:34.490 --> 02:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
lucky that saus are allowed to carry
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
over a fund balance year to year uh
 
02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
you're not in your District but your SCU
 
02:49:41.330 --> 02:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
is the seu has been prudently budgeting
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're able to take
 
02:49:44.690 --> 02:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
care of things the other big thing in
 
02:49:46.849 --> 02:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
our SAU budget is the is the legal
 
02:49:48.650 --> 02:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
budget you know we have to hire our
 
02:49:51.650 --> 02:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
lawyers for um negotiations and so forth
 
02:49:52.969 --> 02:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
I mean if you have a year where you have
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
a bunch of negotiations or you get sued
 
02:49:57.170 --> 02:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
on something that legal budget goes up
 
02:49:59.330 --> 02:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
and and you've got to find it within
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
your SAU budget there just isn't a whole
 
02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
lot of room
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand what the need for
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is you know I'm North Country it's
 
02:50:08.929 --> 02:50:08.939 align:start position:0%
not broken don't fix it I mean what what
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
are you trying to fix you can already
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
adopt this process if you want to in the
 
02:50:16.130 --> 02:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
present law and you know if you want to
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
know what's happening in your seu budget
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
call the seu and at least in my district
 
02:50:22.370 --> 02:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if everyone else is usually
 
02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'll direct you to a part on our website
 
02:50:27.170 --> 02:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
where the budget is posted
 
02:50:30.889 --> 02:50:30.899 align:start position:0%
and the last thing is local control we
 
02:50:34.010 --> 02:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
seem to like local control a lot but
 
02:50:36.830 --> 02:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
only in certain cases your your school
 
02:50:39.410 --> 02:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
board is elected by the community they
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
make great decisions and I tell you the
 
02:50:44.270 --> 02:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
seu budget gets a lot more scrutiny than
 
02:50:46.389 --> 02:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
any other budget because it's so small
 
02:50:48.590 --> 02:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
everyone knows exactly what it's going
 
02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:50.690 align:start position:0%
everyone knows exactly what it's going
for

02:50:50.690 --> 02:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:50:50.700 --> 02:50:51.950 align:start position:0%
for
done

02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:50:53.690 --> 02:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:56.750 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:58.670 --> 02:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't have any other pink cards on
 
02:51:04.490 --> 02:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
155 so with that I'm going to close this
 
02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:13.610 align:start position:0%
155 so with that I'm going to close this
hearing

02:51:13.610 --> 02:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:51:19.550 --> 02:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:26.770 --> 02:51:26.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:29.809 --> 02:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
so so as a committee what we'll do it
 
02:51:32.210 --> 02:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
because we've canceled the one o'clock
 
02:51:36.170 --> 02:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
to another day 272.
 
02:51:38.450 --> 02:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh but we do want to put a little bit of
 
02:51:40.969 --> 02:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
time to start talking about the side by
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
sides we got for 266 so we'll start that
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
a quarter after one and go for about a
 
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
half hour to get some kind of a course
 
02:51:50.450 --> 02:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
in organization to where we're going to
 
02:51:52.429 --> 02:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
go and how we're going to handle it and
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
then we'll stop at uh at the at the next
 
02:51:57.230 --> 02:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
hearing which files and that should be
 
02:51:59.210 --> 02:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
it for the day yeah
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:07.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:07.380 --> 03:50:11.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:50:11.929 --> 03:50:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
and we're in a work session right now
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
and the work session is for 266 and
 
03:50:22.190 --> 03:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
we have a side by side we have several
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
actually and I want to thank Jennifer
 
03:50:26.990 --> 03:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
for doing that I know that took hours
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
and hours of work
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
days and days
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
and and so we have one that shows you
 
03:50:39.229 --> 03:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
the it looks at the current law and the
 
03:50:41.809 --> 03:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
version as introduced
 
03:50:44.210 --> 03:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
and some notes in the side there's
 
03:50:45.550 --> 03:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
another one
 
03:50:47.809 --> 03:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:50:50.570 --> 03:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh has a lot of reference to numbers and
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
lines and all that and identifies
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong Jennifer but the
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
areas which are highlighted are darker
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
are areas that are not reflected are
 
03:51:02.040 --> 03:51:08.269 align:start position:0%
are areas that are not reflected are
missed

03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah you didn't see it there okay so
 
03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
that will you know attract us to it as
 
03:51:13.380 --> 03:51:20.450 align:start position:0%
that will you know attract us to it as
well

03:51:20.450 --> 03:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.460 --> 03:51:23.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:51:23.330 --> 03:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.490 --> 03:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
yeah it's you'll see that in the back of
 
03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
that document where the indicators of
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
the delivery of an adequate education
 
03:51:31.969 --> 03:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
located 193e
 
03:51:31.979 --> 03:51:33.830 align:start position:0%
located 193e
um three

03:51:33.830 --> 03:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
um three
 
03:51:37.849 --> 03:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
and so let's let's first look at the one
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
which is the current law
 
03:51:42.650 --> 03:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
and the version as introduced we'll
 
03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
we'll walk through that and get a little
 
03:51:46.610 --> 03:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
bit done here and maybe we'll get into
 
03:51:49.490 --> 03:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
the process that you know that we'll be
 
03:51:53.150 --> 03:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
following and this is not going to be
 
03:51:56.150 --> 03:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
a quick deal this is going to take some
 
03:51:57.769 --> 03:51:57.779 align:start position:0%
time that's why we need to start this
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of minutes I understand they
 
03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
and so that that's remarkable that
 
03:52:19.610 --> 03:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
so smart I guess right yeah
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
you should learn strategy
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
we should get help with him yeah uh-huh
 
03:52:32.210 --> 03:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
so let's look at page one there or we
 
03:52:35.690 --> 03:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
see on 193 C colon one the statement of
 
03:52:38.690 --> 03:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
purpose for this section of Law and for
 
03:52:38.700 --> 03:52:40.250 align:start position:0%
purpose for this section of Law and for
266.

03:52:40.250 --> 03:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
266.
 
03:52:42.830 --> 03:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
it says on the right this section is a
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
identical in both versions so I don't
 
03:52:49.610 --> 03:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
think that's neat that we address that
 
03:52:52.849 --> 03:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
page one it looks you know and and I I
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
read through it I know Jen has done the
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:05.450 --> 03:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
so everything that's in the law is in
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
this version as it's written in law
 
03:53:07.680 --> 03:53:10.309 align:start position:0%
this version as it's written in law
currently

03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.969 --> 03:53:13.979 align:start position:0%
then we go to page three and we start to
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
see some things which I think will you
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
know cause some questioning
 
03:53:23.690 --> 03:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
the term at the top of Page Three where
 
03:53:25.969 --> 03:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
it says committee means the legislative
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee established to
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
review the Statewide education
 
03:53:32.450 --> 03:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
Improvement and Assessment program
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's been removed
 
03:53:37.610 --> 03:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
does it make a difference one way or the
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
other I don't know but we're talking
 
03:53:43.010 --> 03:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
about us the legislative oversight
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
committee and if that's removed
 
03:53:45.479 --> 03:53:46.490 align:start position:0%
committee and if that's removed
somewhere

03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:05.279 --> 03:54:07.429 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
when it
 
03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
when things start moving from one
 
03:54:15.050 --> 03:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
chapter to another chapter I ask why is
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
it easier to read is it easier to follow
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
or is it meaning that you're not
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
um so it's something we need to look at
 
03:54:25.319 --> 03:54:27.650 align:start position:0%
um so it's something we need to look at
it

03:54:27.650 --> 03:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:54:30.769 --> 03:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
the end size I understand that
 
03:54:32.990 --> 03:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
in size meets the students sample size
 
03:54:35.809 --> 03:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
necessary disclose or display data to
 
03:54:38.450 --> 03:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
ensure maximum student group visibility
 
03:54:40.610 --> 03:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
that's it's a it's a term that's used
 
03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:45.550 align:start position:0%
that's it's a it's a term that's used
commonly

03:54:45.550 --> 03:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:48.290 --> 03:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
then as you slide down a little bit
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see academic standards
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
now everybody knows the academic
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
standards have to be approved by the
 
03:54:57.889 --> 03:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education along with the
 
03:54:59.210 --> 03:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
approval have to be approved by the
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
state board
 
03:55:05.630 --> 03:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
but if you also look what are the
 
03:55:06.889 --> 03:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of legislative
 
03:55:06.899 --> 03:55:08.929 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of legislative
oversight

03:55:08.929 --> 03:55:08.939 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
they have the responsibility for
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
bringing by any recommendations or
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
changes regarding the
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
um accuracy it's the academic standards
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
I I'm trying to remember
 
03:55:24.889 --> 03:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
the academic stems has come to us
 
03:55:27.530 --> 03:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards I don't think it's
 
03:55:29.090 --> 03:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
clearly written
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
in our oversight responsibilities or
 
03:55:31.319 --> 03:55:32.410 align:start position:0%
in our oversight responsibilities or
duties

03:55:32.410 --> 03:55:32.420 align:start position:0%
duties
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
question Rick yes
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
how did we know whether they may win the
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
academic standards are supposed to be
 
03:55:41.570 --> 03:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
measures at the end of the grade level
 
03:55:41.580 --> 03:55:42.590 align:start position:0%
measures at the end of the grade level
or

03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
during the Great loving is it to get
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
into that grade or you get out of that
 
03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:47.929 align:start position:0%
into that grade or you get out of that
grade

03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
grade
 
03:55:47.939 --> 03:55:50.689 align:start position:0%
grade
well

03:55:50.689 --> 03:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
academic standards mean what a student
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do and a
 
03:55:57.769 --> 03:55:57.779 align:start position:0%
course well but see if we're dealing
 
03:55:59.150 --> 03:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the language we have right here
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah because we're not rewriting the
 
03:56:02.570 --> 03:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
whole thing we're just going through and
 
03:56:04.729 --> 03:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
seeing what they've done but you notice
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:12.769 --> 03:56:12.779 align:start position:0%
they're talking about grade level
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
do you have instruction and curriculum
 
03:56:18.410 --> 03:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
at the high school in terms of grade
 
03:56:22.210 --> 03:56:22.220 align:start position:0%
level or in terms of course
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes you got it and course is missing
 
03:56:29.689 --> 03:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
my question to him is why
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
we put that in we the legislature put
 
03:56:33.769 --> 03:56:33.779 align:start position:0%
that in
 
03:56:35.570 --> 03:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
few years back
 
03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
we recognize that you know the
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:44.689 --> 03:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious if there's any comment
 
03:56:46.969 --> 03:56:46.979 align:start position:0%
regarding that because it's a it could
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:57.889 --> 03:56:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:00.650 --> 03:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
so so I highlighted that one myself
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
since as something we ought to be
 
03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
looking at check it off
 
03:57:08.090 --> 03:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
um then they're also not calling them
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
academic standards they're calling them
 
03:57:13.729 --> 03:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
Statewide academic standards
 
03:57:13.739 --> 03:57:15.050 align:start position:0%
Statewide academic standards
right

03:57:15.050 --> 03:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
is that a clearer
 
03:57:18.479 --> 03:57:20.150 align:start position:0%
is that a clearer
definition

03:57:20.150 --> 03:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:57:22.250 --> 03:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
or is that a confusing definition now
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
what's different between academic
 
03:57:26.090 --> 03:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
standards and Statewide academically
 
03:57:35.689 --> 03:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:38.330 --> 03:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
we have had so many definitions using
 
03:57:40.370 --> 03:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
the word standards that's very confusing
 
03:57:49.130 --> 03:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:51.290 --> 03:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
we have a choice about using some other
 
03:57:53.450 --> 03:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
academic standard than the Statewide
 
03:57:53.460 --> 03:57:55.550 align:start position:0%
academic standard than the Statewide
standards

03:57:55.550 --> 03:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
03:58:00.050 --> 03:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
so like what other academic standard and
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just use the state line
 
03:58:02.699 --> 03:58:03.889 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just use the state line
once

03:58:03.889 --> 03:58:03.899 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:58:07.250 --> 03:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose so that this raises a
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
question yeah so that's another thing we
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
ought to be checking off for we we
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
wonder about that so it goes down
 
03:58:16.130 --> 03:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
through this you can see almost there's
 
03:58:17.689 --> 03:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
going to be this type of discussion just
 
03:58:19.490 --> 03:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
about in every page we're going to go to
 
03:58:19.500 --> 03:58:21.050 align:start position:0%
about in every page we're going to go to
yeah

03:58:21.050 --> 03:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
on testing entity
 
03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
yeah is there a question there
 
03:58:29.330 --> 03:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:33.769 --> 03:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
they put we had under RSA 193 C's colon
 
03:58:37.250 --> 03:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
six so we gotta look through that area
 
03:58:39.530 --> 03:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's gone
 
03:58:46.450 --> 03:58:46.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:50.210 --> 03:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
they couldn't make it here so it's I
 
03:58:51.650 --> 03:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
think it's wise that we go through so
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
that's right they they'll give us
 
03:59:00.650 --> 03:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
technical advice or support when we need
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.840 --> 03:59:14.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:59:14.809 --> 03:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
adds a reference to oversight committee
 
03:59:35.450 --> 03:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
proposed to be moved to chapter 193 e
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
oh that's that was in the remember in
 
03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
the definition yeah so where it was
 
03:59:43.010 --> 03:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
moved to the east yeah and now they're
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:52.689 --> 03:59:52.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
we just gotta keep it up here so we can
 
04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.809 --> 04:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
um if you go to page four
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
SB 2266 changes open-ended performance
 
04:00:17.929 --> 04:00:17.939 align:start position:0%
tasks to other item types identified by
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
department and testing entity as
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
necessary as Jen has written
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
you noticed right there on the current
 
04:00:27.650 --> 04:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
side under Roman 2 there's a c
 
04:00:32.570 --> 04:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
these are assessed assessment
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
instruments we use to identify
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
where the uh somebody's measuring up to
 
04:00:43.729 --> 04:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
those minimum competencies
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
and we know there's the Statewide
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
assessment there's other ways of doing
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
it as well
 
04:00:48.720 --> 04:00:49.729 align:start position:0%
it as well
yeah

04:00:49.729 --> 04:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
open space assessment and that's what
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
fast so they're taking up
 
04:01:01.610 --> 04:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.620 --> 04:01:03.290 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

04:01:03.290 --> 04:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
04:01:03.300 --> 04:01:05.050 align:start position:0%
interesting
student

04:01:05.050 --> 04:01:05.060 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:01:08.809 --> 04:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
they use this term testing entity what's
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
that mean what does it mean
 
04:01:11.279 --> 04:01:13.030 align:start position:0%
that mean what does it mean
s

04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
s
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
whoever they contract with for the state
 
04:01:18.530 --> 04:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay so if they contract with say I
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't know measured progress
 
04:01:23.150 --> 04:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
that would be the entity for testing
 
04:01:26.809 --> 04:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
okay now you you recall when we had Pace
 
04:01:30.349 --> 04:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
yes Pace districts that that we had
 
04:01:33.889 --> 04:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
peace districts and that was Yeah Austin
 
04:01:36.650 --> 04:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
you want me to see what the pace means
 
04:01:39.889 --> 04:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
that was when pbass first yeah was being
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
tested out it was another way that a
 
04:01:47.090 --> 04:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
number of districts were were looking at
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
competencies and as as representative
 
04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
Cascadian be able to test out of that
 
04:01:54.290 --> 04:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
and move to the next level yeah of of
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
Competency without having to have the
 
04:01:59.689 --> 04:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment do that number for
 
04:02:02.450 --> 04:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
them we had to get approval from the
 
04:02:04.610 --> 04:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
federal government to do that yeah in
 
04:02:06.530 --> 04:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
our waiver yeah there were eight uh
 
04:02:09.050 --> 04:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
eight districts in the past yeah that
 
04:02:10.910 --> 04:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
was that pilot yeah
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
rationally no no
 
04:02:15.650 --> 04:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
development of October so does that
 
04:02:18.769 --> 04:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
program still offering
 
04:02:21.849 --> 04:02:21.859 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know I mean there's no
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
oversight I mean there's no leadership
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.319 --> 04:02:35.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:02:35.650 --> 04:02:35.660 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:02:38.330 --> 04:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
but see though they've got other item
 
04:02:40.969 --> 04:02:40.979 align:start position:0%
types identified
 
04:02:44.450 --> 04:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that really means is
 
04:02:46.370 --> 04:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
that some other kind of a test or is
 
04:02:49.849 --> 04:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
that a a some kind of a portfolio or
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of a performance of some kind
 
04:02:52.560 --> 04:03:01.849 align:start position:0%
some kind of a performance of some kind
uh

04:03:01.849 --> 04:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.189 --> 04:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
since that's that type of multiple
 
04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
choice yes
 
04:03:06.479 --> 04:03:11.870 align:start position:0%
choice yes
to

04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.229 --> 04:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
Notch it kind of open-ended performance
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
passed but that would open it up to like
 
04:03:19.849 --> 04:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
portfolio yeah I was just thinking that
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:26.330 --> 04:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
see in that would be like an essay
 
04:03:26.340 --> 04:03:27.830 align:start position:0%
see in that would be like an essay
question

04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:03:27.840 --> 04:03:33.110 align:start position:0%
question
yeah yeah

04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wrote down other performance
 
04:03:37.450 --> 04:03:37.460 align:start position:0%
tasks to appropriately measure learning
 
04:03:40.250 --> 04:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
measure student learning
 
04:03:40.260 --> 04:03:40.849 align:start position:0%
measure student learning
um

04:03:40.849 --> 04:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
but it's Marine Corps schools other
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
performance tasks
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
yeah other performance tasks which is a
 
04:03:50.570 --> 04:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
broader ability for you to develop
 
04:03:53.929 --> 04:03:53.939 align:start position:0%
locally as to what you want to use to
 
04:03:53.939 --> 04:03:55.849 align:start position:0%
locally as to what you want to use to
measure

04:03:55.849 --> 04:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
measure
 
04:03:58.610 --> 04:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
but some systems use things that don't
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
have solutions to test your response to
 
04:04:05.210 --> 04:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
a set of crises or criteria or whatever
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
and there is no solution they want to
 
04:04:10.670 --> 04:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
see how you respond to it
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
put a grade on that
 
04:04:12.840 --> 04:04:25.210 align:start position:0%
put a grade on that
foreign

04:04:25.210 --> 04:04:25.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
I was concerned on this academic
 
04:04:30.830 --> 04:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
standards Roman 3 there a
 
04:04:33.410 --> 04:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
academic standards specifying what
 
04:04:35.090 --> 04:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
students should know and be able to do
 
04:04:36.710 --> 04:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
shall be clearly defined before
 
04:04:39.170 --> 04:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
assessment procedures and exercises are
 
04:04:42.170 --> 04:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
developed that's been put in into law
 
04:04:44.330 --> 04:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
here ever since
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.210 --> 04:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
um they're writing Statewide academic
 
04:04:51.889 --> 04:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
standards established by the department
 
04:04:53.929 --> 04:04:53.939 align:start position:0%
in consultation with Educators and
 
04:04:53.939 --> 04:04:55.490 align:start position:0%
in consultation with Educators and
stakeholders

04:04:55.490 --> 04:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
04:04:57.889 --> 04:04:57.899 align:start position:0%
which shall be used to identify grade
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
level expectations and standardized cut
 
04:04:59.880 --> 04:05:01.969 align:start position:0%
level expectations and standardized cut
scores

04:05:01.969 --> 04:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
scores
 
04:05:05.090 --> 04:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
we also have in law later on and
 
04:05:06.530 --> 04:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
receiving prior review and
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the legislative
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
that's in the the bill we just passed
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
this last year
 
04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:32.889 --> 04:05:32.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.490 --> 04:05:36.500 align:start position:0%
so page three was easy
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
well notice it says Who develops it the
 
04:05:39.600 --> 04:05:40.790 align:start position:0%
well notice it says Who develops it the
department

04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:05:45.769 --> 04:05:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
well it does say what stakeholders yeah
 
04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
I think that historically that's been
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
part of the practice I think of bringing
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
the teachers and administrators in to
 
04:05:59.450 --> 04:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
deal with it so yeah they talked about
 
04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
that the other day the standards which
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
were approved the Next Generation
 
04:06:05.809 --> 04:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
science standards had to receive
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
approval from the legislative oversight
 
04:06:08.279 --> 04:06:09.349 align:start position:0%
approval from the legislative oversight
committee

04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:06:12.050 --> 04:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
and this is excluding that group that's
 
04:06:21.170 --> 04:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.450 --> 04:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
Christian isn't the same reading
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
proficiency here is it the same as
 
04:06:27.170 --> 04:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
reading Proficiency in Mississippi
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
well they they set those they set the
 
04:06:29.399 --> 04:06:30.309 align:start position:0%
well they they set those they set the
bar

04:06:30.309 --> 04:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
bar
 
04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
like proficiency one versus proficiency
 
04:06:33.000 --> 04:06:34.070 align:start position:0%
like proficiency one versus proficiency
two

04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:06:34.080 --> 04:06:37.750 align:start position:0%
two
Etc

04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.250 --> 04:06:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
out in the communities think proficient
 
04:06:46.689 --> 04:06:46.699 align:start position:0%
things pass
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
the feds do have one two three four
 
04:06:49.080 --> 04:06:54.050 align:start position:0%
the feds do have one two three four
right

04:06:54.050 --> 04:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:56.330 --> 04:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
but they they have minimum levels
 
04:06:58.490 --> 04:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
minimum bars for example the minimum bar
 
04:07:01.130 --> 04:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
for graduation
 
04:07:03.170 --> 04:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
I believe it's
 
04:07:06.170 --> 04:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
60 or 67 percent of kids graduating from
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
high school
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
our graduation rate is close to 89 90
 
04:07:10.739 --> 04:07:12.050 align:start position:0%
our graduation rate is close to 89 90
percent

04:07:12.050 --> 04:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
but we're using their bar because that's
 
04:07:16.969 --> 04:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
the bar they use for Essa
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
the every student succeeds act it's it's
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
the elementary secondary Education Act
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
we did
 
04:07:32.570 --> 04:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
and and because it has to move every
 
04:07:35.330 --> 04:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
year or it's supposed to move up you
 
04:07:36.889 --> 04:07:36.899 align:start position:0%
know one of those the proficiencies
 
04:07:39.530 --> 04:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
thing is supposed to move up so as you
 
04:07:42.050 --> 04:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
make it you never catch up you know some
 
04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
people have never told me we were saying
 
04:07:44.100 --> 04:07:44.929 align:start position:0%
people have never told me we were saying
how

04:07:44.929 --> 04:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:07:48.769 --> 04:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
if we're at 91 and the bar federally is
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
like at 67 you know making us move up to
 
04:07:56.450 --> 04:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
92 or 93 is is a lot tougher than ever
 
04:08:00.410 --> 04:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.809 --> 04:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
it's it's just like in the CTA
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell where we have
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
allocated nine million dollars each and
 
04:08:10.729 --> 04:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
now we're going to 11. that is our
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort now will always
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to be at least 11 million we can't
 
04:08:16.010 --> 04:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
go down
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
if we want to get the federal money
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
so you have to maintain your maintenance
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
of effort and the same thing applies to
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
these scores you raise that bar you're
 
04:08:26.929 --> 04:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
not going to go back down
 
04:08:29.330 --> 04:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
so they put the minimum bar in our
 
04:08:29.340 --> 04:08:30.769 align:start position:0%
so they put the minimum bar in our
statutes

04:08:30.769 --> 04:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not reflective of the Granite
 
04:08:35.450 --> 04:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
State 67 graduation I don't know how
 
04:08:37.130 --> 04:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
they do one two three or four though I
 
04:08:42.349 --> 04:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
as a um standards that that we had
 
04:08:48.110 --> 04:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
because I that I thought that we didn't
 
04:08:50.210 --> 04:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
take the enrollment probably
 
04:08:52.370 --> 04:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
we had a higher borrowing that that was
 
04:08:54.849 --> 04:08:54.859 align:start position:0%
part of the problem that had improved
 
04:08:58.010 --> 04:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
I can remember Senator guy to going off
 
04:08:59.929 --> 04:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
his nut on that because he wanted it
 
04:09:04.250 --> 04:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
higher yeah yeah yeah and uh no we kept
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
it that low bar because
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
Federal money
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
the final that's a state plan is is
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.570 --> 04:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
I had another note on that question that
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
04:09:24.530 --> 04:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
in the current law it says what students
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
should know and my emphasis anything
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
that you do
 
04:09:32.210 --> 04:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
and in the draft that language is taken
 
04:09:32.220 --> 04:09:34.670 align:start position:0%
and in the draft that language is taken
out

04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
I mean it shouldn't just be that you
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
have knowledge it should be that you're
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:49.610 --> 04:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:00.250 --> 04:10:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.570 --> 04:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is just building
 
04:10:04.370 --> 04:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
some awareness right now so when we do
 
04:10:06.610 --> 04:10:06.620 align:start position:0%
sit down with them
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
we have some talking points already
 
04:10:14.929 --> 04:10:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.939 --> 04:10:22.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:22.269 --> 04:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we're down at the bottom page four
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
right now and
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
I think we can skip over to page five
 
04:10:31.800 --> 04:10:33.349 align:start position:0%
I think we can skip over to page five
and

04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:35.090 --> 04:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
they're putting in to improve
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:46.250 --> 04:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
unless there's something
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
I don't really have a gut ache on any of
 
04:10:48.180 --> 04:11:03.550 align:start position:0%
I don't really have a gut ache on any of
that

04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
on Page Six
 
04:11:10.849 --> 04:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
you look at item I
 
04:11:13.969 --> 04:11:13.979 align:start position:0%
and they're taking out
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
the part that basically
 
04:11:18.650 --> 04:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
we have taken out in finance
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
the the differentiated aid for third
 
04:11:23.570 --> 04:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
grade reading
 
04:11:26.330 --> 04:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
my question is though
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
um should we have the part that says at
 
04:11:30.050 --> 04:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
the end of the grade three to determine
 
04:11:31.729 --> 04:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
that people sorry should we have that
 
04:11:33.889 --> 04:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
right down to where on the middle there
 
04:11:36.650 --> 04:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
it says Department as part of a
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide Assessment program period
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
and leaving the differentiate Aid stuff
 
04:11:41.760 --> 04:11:44.410 align:start position:0%
and leaving the differentiate Aid stuff
out

04:11:44.410 --> 04:11:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:47.330 --> 04:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
right so what you're saying is only
 
04:11:49.849 --> 04:11:49.859 align:start position:0%
remove the money part of it yeah
 
04:11:52.490 --> 04:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
we would still be assessing we want to
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
assess that's exactly right that third
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
graders that's where the Statewide
 
04:12:01.010 --> 04:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
so I was just scratching out that latter
 
04:12:14.090 --> 04:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
but you've got to have an assessment
 
04:12:18.170 --> 04:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
unless you're not going to
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
is the reading this assessment
 
04:12:24.290 --> 04:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
the 19840.
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
04:12:29.570 --> 04:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so did we just take the latter part
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
of that sends out and leave referencing
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
to the third grade testing in
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.210 --> 04:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
it's and I was wondering why if you're
 
04:12:43.370 --> 04:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
with us Jen where it says this section
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:53.570 --> 04:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
okay because one says shall one says May
 
04:12:55.849 --> 04:12:55.859 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education shall adopt
 
04:12:55.859 --> 04:12:56.990 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education shall adopt
rules

04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:12:58.969 --> 04:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
and the other side the State Board of
 
04:13:15.530 --> 04:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
exemption yeah
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
the second line
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
so the question asked do we need rules
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
or does the statutory language say it
 
04:13:29.689 --> 04:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
well enough is that is that where they
 
04:13:32.450 --> 04:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
said there were no rules they shall and
 
04:13:33.469 --> 04:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
they haven't
 
04:13:36.290 --> 04:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
they had never developed they just go by
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the statue yeah right and if you go by
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
Statue you get it done quicker you know
 
04:13:44.269 --> 04:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
rule making gel car is a long process so
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
but it might be a question mark when we
 
04:13:48.290 --> 04:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
have a chance to have Nate in here we
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure things are
 
04:14:04.800 --> 04:14:07.790 align:start position:0%
to make sure things are
functions

04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.800 --> 04:14:09.769 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:14:09.769 --> 04:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:14:12.410 --> 04:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh we have about three more minutes here
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters came in to help us
 
04:14:15.239 --> 04:14:18.130 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters came in to help us
um

04:14:18.130 --> 04:14:18.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
the next part there is the part which
 
04:14:23.570 --> 04:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
the components the areas that make up
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.590 --> 04:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
when I first came in the legislature
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
it went
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
mathematics science and
 
04:14:38.330 --> 04:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
those other areas as a requirement of
 
04:14:40.729 --> 04:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
the state assessment now because we
 
04:14:42.290 --> 04:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
weren't doing it history geography
 
04:14:44.450 --> 04:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
civics economics
 
04:14:57.010 --> 04:14:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.170 --> 04:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
well we gave it to the local to make the
 
04:15:00.180 --> 04:15:01.130 align:start position:0%
well we gave it to the local to make the
decision

04:15:01.130 --> 04:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
how they were going to do that right
 
04:15:03.889 --> 04:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
there's no Statewide assessment for
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't know
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
a place but I think there should be
 
04:15:12.490 --> 04:15:12.500 align:start position:0%
assessment thinking about yesterday
 
04:15:16.490 --> 04:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
yesterday's when you know Senator Carson
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
Senator dalessandro were in here it gave
 
04:15:20.570 --> 04:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
cost for us to really start thinking
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:26.929 --> 04:15:26.939 align:start position:0%
so maybe that maybe this is a good place
 
04:15:28.490 --> 04:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
to stop right now because we're going to
 
04:15:31.370 --> 04:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
go into that but so we're going to need
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
this set up a day
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
to go through this and it's so if if
 
04:15:40.729 --> 04:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
everybody's able to try and look at
 
04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
these things
 
04:15:45.769 --> 04:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
and to you know find things which may be
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
of you know concern
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.750 --> 04:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
I've gone through and I've found places
 
04:15:55.370 --> 04:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
just like we found the other day that
 
04:16:00.650 --> 04:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
the word competencies
 
04:16:03.530 --> 04:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
that are in statute are not is not the
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
same definition they're putting a new
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
ed306 rules
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
so there's there's not going to be a
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
reference back
 
04:16:13.319 --> 04:16:19.309 align:start position:0%
reference back
no

04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:21.170 --> 04:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll close the work session
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
right here and we'll set it up on the
 
04:16:29.210 --> 04:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:31.130 --> 04:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a little bit here we
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
can't do it next week of course because
 
04:16:35.210 --> 04:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
we we haven't put it in the calendar
 
04:16:37.370 --> 04:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
and the following week
 
04:16:39.530 --> 04:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
let's see next week is the budget
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
getting it over right
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
and then the following week we're going
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
to have to exec some of our bills which
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:16:47.040 --> 04:16:49.309 align:start position:0%
we have
yeah

04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.710 --> 04:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be somewhere either
 
04:16:54.290 --> 04:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
possibly in that week or the week after
 
04:16:56.929 --> 04:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
we'll start this this could take several
 
04:16:56.939 --> 04:16:59.450 align:start position:0%
we'll start this this could take several
days

04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.809 --> 04:17:02.819 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah who selects vendors
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
the skateboard does
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.050 --> 04:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
have we got any new bills for uh today
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
and there were no bills for education on
 
04:17:19.250 --> 04:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar
 
04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
and there were just now consent
 
04:17:22.920 --> 04:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
and there were just now consent
yeah

04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:17:24.000 --> 04:17:31.250 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

04:17:31.250 --> 04:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:31.260 --> 04:17:40.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:40.570 --> 04:17:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.269 --> 04:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
okay we have a bill right now uh that
 
04:17:46.250 --> 04:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
we're needing to go in in the hearing
 
04:17:46.260 --> 04:17:49.969 align:start position:0%
we're needing to go in in the hearing
process

04:17:49.969 --> 04:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
you do
 
04:17:51.960 --> 04:17:54.170 align:start position:0%
you do
yourself

04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
04:17:54.180 --> 04:17:59.870 align:start position:0%
yourself
okay

04:17:59.870 --> 04:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:08.330 --> 04:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
more accomplished okay
 
04:18:12.530 --> 04:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at SB 213
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
relative to educational institution
 
04:18:17.570 --> 04:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
policies on social media
 
04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to welcome Senator Waters
 
04:18:23.150 --> 04:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
through education thank you very much Mr
 
04:18:25.070 --> 04:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
chair Mr Vice chairman members of the
 
04:18:27.290 --> 04:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
committee Senator David Waters District
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
Ford introduce some
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 213.
 
04:18:33.950 --> 04:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
um this bill makes a couple of small
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
changes to our social media
 
04:18:38.290 --> 04:18:38.300 align:start position:0%
and student use
 
04:18:43.010 --> 04:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
statutes and um it arises from some
 
04:18:44.990 --> 04:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
information we began to receive last
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
summer from Educators and also
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
conversations we had with doe and with
 
04:18:54.530 --> 04:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
the Career and Technical education
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
advisory Council and so worked during
 
04:18:59.769 --> 04:18:59.779 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
and up until really just a couple days
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
ago to come up with some language about
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
it and there's really two parts here let
 
04:19:08.090 --> 04:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
me explain them separately the first
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
part of the bill
 
04:19:11.090 --> 04:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
but let me just actually let me say a
 
04:19:13.130 --> 04:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
word about social media policy
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
um some of us in the room were here a
 
04:19:17.630 --> 04:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
number of years ago
 
04:19:20.689 --> 04:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
um when we did the work on social uh
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
media policy uh in part because of a of
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
a need to tighten up and to make sure
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
we're accounting for the new
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
technologies and also quite tragically
 
04:19:32.210 --> 04:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
some situations in a couple of schools
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
where social media had been related to
 
04:19:37.490 --> 04:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
some abuse so we you know we I think we
 
04:19:38.809 --> 04:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
really worked very
 
04:19:41.689 --> 04:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh very well in the house of Senator
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
crafts some really good legislation uh
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
as time has gone by it's clear we need
 
04:19:47.809 --> 04:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
to tweak it a little bit for a couple
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
reasons um the first part here
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
um really you uh might think of it as
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
the LinkedIn Amendment
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
um that there are students who are
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
preparing to have credentials they can
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
present so they can get certification or
 
04:20:05.150 --> 04:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
employment and uh superintendents and
 
04:20:07.490 --> 04:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
others were saying well no no under the
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
policies that they sought in statute we
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't let students under the
 
04:20:14.210 --> 04:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
supervision of teachers use LinkedIn so
 
04:20:16.189 --> 04:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get their credentials out
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
on that platform potentially other ones
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
um the second one
 
04:20:24.170 --> 04:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
comes more particularly related to
 
04:20:27.290 --> 04:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education that
 
04:20:30.410 --> 04:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
there are several curricular platforms I
 
04:20:34.250 --> 04:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
think particularly in edu in engineering
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
um but also uh accelerated by the covet
 
04:20:41.450 --> 04:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
epidemic in areas like welding and an
 
04:20:43.010 --> 04:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
auto repair where there's really good
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
online curriculum available but we need
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
to make a change to our statute uh about
 
04:20:50.929 --> 04:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
allowing that under teacher supervision
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
and with parental consent
 
04:20:57.050 --> 04:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
because some superintendents were
 
04:20:59.330 --> 04:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
reading our existing statute to say no
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
even though it seemed to me then the
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
statute existing that they are we could
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
hardly do that but they will look into
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
different area statute and saying we
 
04:21:09.050 --> 04:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
don't think we can do it so that this
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
will clarify that Authority and um so
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see here uh in the existing
 
04:21:20.110 --> 04:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
version of paragraph two that being
 
04:21:22.370 --> 04:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
addressed I had to send to
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
electronically since we passed this in
 
04:21:26.929 --> 04:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
the Senate doe came forward and said we
 
04:21:29.210 --> 04:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
really think that we need to make just a
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
couple changes in the warning in part
 
04:21:33.229 --> 04:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
two and I think rather importantly put
 
04:21:35.889 --> 04:21:35.899 align:start position:0%
it in into
 
04:21:39.050 --> 04:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
189 66
 
04:21:42.050 --> 04:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
rather than in 189.70.
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
and partly the reason for that is to
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are very clear on the
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
requirement of parental consent for
 
04:21:51.600 --> 04:21:52.910 align:start position:0%
requirement of parental consent for
opt-in

04:21:52.910 --> 04:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
04:21:55.010 --> 04:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
and that's the section of Statute where
 
04:21:58.010 --> 04:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
that this belongs then and um we think
 
04:21:59.809 --> 04:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
this is really essential that we have a
 
04:22:02.689 --> 04:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
parental opt-in specified uh here
 
04:22:04.969 --> 04:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
written parental consent
 
04:22:04.979 --> 04:22:06.050 align:start position:0%
written parental consent
um

04:22:06.050 --> 04:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
so what the it will now read on part two
 
04:22:11.150 --> 04:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
and again I we emailed it to you in the
 
04:22:13.370 --> 04:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
the chair has a few copies
 
04:22:15.170 --> 04:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
um students participating in career
 
04:22:15.180 --> 04:22:16.490 align:start position:0%
um students participating in career
exploration

04:22:16.490 --> 04:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
exploration
 
04:22:19.010 --> 04:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
or Career and Technical education May
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
with written parental consent register
 
04:22:25.250 --> 04:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
for technology platforms and services to
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
be used as part of the students program
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
and study and that's important too it's
 
04:22:31.010 --> 04:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
not just for any other reason it's
 
04:22:32.570 --> 04:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
because they've got to use that
 
04:22:34.210 --> 04:22:34.220 align:start position:0%
engineering curriculum or that
 
04:22:37.250 --> 04:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
Automotive or whatever it might be or a
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
lot of the biological sciences too which
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
require the provision of personally
 
04:22:43.490 --> 04:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
identifiable information copies of
 
04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
written parental consent shall be
 
04:22:46.849 --> 04:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
retained as part of a student's
 
04:22:49.250 --> 04:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
educational record
 
04:22:52.490 --> 04:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
um so uh this has been a I'm really
 
04:22:54.170 --> 04:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
appreciative to the attorneys at the
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who brought
 
04:22:55.920 --> 04:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who brought
forward

04:22:56.950 --> 04:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
these issues and the way to deal with
 
04:23:01.130 --> 04:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
them and here's the Bill thank you Mr
 
04:23:04.130 --> 04:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Senator Waters I I received
 
04:23:07.210 --> 04:23:07.220 align:start position:0%
a communication from Jeff beard
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll read it and then you can tell
 
04:23:13.610 --> 04:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
me is this amendment addressing what
 
04:23:15.530 --> 04:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
Jeff is saying here
 
04:23:18.170 --> 04:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
he says I agree and if it is possible
 
04:23:22.250 --> 04:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
amending RSA 18966 would address the
 
04:23:25.370 --> 04:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
issue we've discussed of CTE teachers
 
04:23:28.370 --> 04:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
and students finding it difficult to
 
04:23:31.870 --> 04:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
access industry recognized credential
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
Assessments in Industry standard tools
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
such as Adobe Pro and SolidWorks in the
 
04:23:41.929 --> 04:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
CTE programs so does this amendment take
 
04:23:44.570 --> 04:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
care of what the director is saying yes
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
and what um thanks for your question
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
what um Jeff beard did was he took that
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the attorney
 
04:23:55.490 --> 04:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
in Department of Education who drafted
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
it this way to account for for that and
 
04:24:00.110 --> 04:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure we have the written
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
parental consent so what you see before
 
04:24:06.889 --> 04:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
you is what the deal we attorney and
 
04:24:09.650 --> 04:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner aw signed off on
 
04:24:12.889 --> 04:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
are there questions of Senator Waters
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
I would just think that um I'll take a
 
04:24:18.590 --> 04:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
look but I think we also have in line
 
04:24:20.090 --> 04:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
with this amendment have to take a look
 
04:24:24.410 --> 04:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
at 189 68a which deals with online
 
04:24:28.729 --> 04:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
personal information and systems which
 
04:24:31.389 --> 04:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
require personal information
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
I think we have to
 
04:24:38.809 --> 04:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
check that section also thank you yes
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald thank you Mr
 
04:24:44.330 --> 04:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Senator Waters line
 
04:24:46.610 --> 04:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
seven of the bill mentions Career
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
Development could you speak a little bit
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
more as to what careers your the intent
 
04:24:54.410 --> 04:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
of the bill is trying to include
 
04:24:56.269 --> 04:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry which part of are you
 
04:24:56.279 --> 04:24:57.769 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry which part of are you
referencing

04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
line seven specifically Career
 
04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
Development yeah like just which careers
 
04:25:02.340 --> 04:25:03.950 align:start position:0%
Development yeah like just which careers
yeah

04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:25:03.960 --> 04:25:05.030 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:08.689 --> 04:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
I think that that was um
 
04:25:08.699 --> 04:25:10.750 align:start position:0%
I think that that was um
done

04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
relatively generically of that phrase so
 
04:25:16.610 --> 04:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
that we didn't say LinkedIn or some of
 
04:25:18.889 --> 04:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
the other platforms that are used by
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
particular fields that you'd want to
 
04:25:21.000 --> 04:25:22.370 align:start position:0%
particular fields that you'd want to
demonstrate

04:25:22.370 --> 04:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
04:25:24.889 --> 04:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
your student Career Development and what
 
04:25:27.170 --> 04:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
this what these essentially do is that
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
it lets you
 
04:25:30.050 --> 04:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
um say I had took this course took this
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
course took this course that these are
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that we use to qualify me for
 
04:25:36.530 --> 04:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
getting this credential or forgetting
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
that job so that's why that the first
 
04:25:41.929 --> 04:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
phrase that way I think you know doe who
 
04:25:44.090 --> 04:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
created this language can perhaps
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
explain a little more educational ease
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
why this is the way to go but it was
 
04:25:50.929 --> 04:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
meant to be fairly clear that it's
 
04:25:53.090 --> 04:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
student Career Development so this is
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
why it's related to credentialing and
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
other other things but without being so
 
04:25:59.570 --> 04:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
specific that we delimited what
 
04:26:01.610 --> 04:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
platforms might be useful for a given
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
field could I ask a follow-up go ahead
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
is there anything within this build that
 
04:26:08.809 --> 04:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
would prevent a student who thinks they
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
could perhaps be developing a career
 
04:26:14.210 --> 04:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
such as a influencer on social media new
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
ideas some students have is there
 
04:26:17.929 --> 04:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill that would prevent
 
04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
them from doing that because it's not
 
04:26:23.689 --> 04:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
School related but they might believe
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's School related or will develop
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
their career and
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
well it's a unique way I guess yeah an
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
extra question let's you know you know
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
work with representative Kirk and
 
04:26:40.070 --> 04:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Reagan and and I kind of really
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
worked on these because I you know
 
04:26:43.910 --> 04:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
protecting our students is Paramount to
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
me yes and let's consider and
 
04:26:49.729 --> 04:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
Vice chair cordelli rightly saying let's
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
look make sure we button it up with 168.
 
04:26:55.610 --> 04:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
is that this is under supervision
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
and a smooth parental consent so those
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
questions will be asked well what
 
04:27:02.090 --> 04:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
exactly what job you're going to apply
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
for what credential you're going to get
 
04:27:05.210 --> 04:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
and if there are legitimate
 
04:27:07.370 --> 04:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
credentialings in those in those areas
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's what's appropriate here if if
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
there aren't then they can go do that at
 
04:27:11.520 --> 04:27:12.469 align:start position:0%
there aren't then they can go do that at
home

04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
but as far as demonstrating educational
 
04:27:15.359 --> 04:27:17.149 align:start position:0%
but as far as demonstrating educational
accomplishment

04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
accomplishment
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
these are the controls all right thank
 
04:27:20.570 --> 04:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
you that answers the question
 
04:27:23.450 --> 04:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Senator
 
04:27:28.250 --> 04:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
Waters um I just wanted to address the
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
sort of underlying idea here of
 
04:27:30.359 --> 04:27:32.030 align:start position:0%
sort of underlying idea here of
utilizing

04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
utilizing
 
04:27:33.950 --> 04:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
um such as social media platforms for
 
04:27:36.050 --> 04:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
career development can you speak to
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's any cause for
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
concern that if we're going to possibly
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
Advance students using particular social
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
media platforms to act as sort of
 
04:27:48.889 --> 04:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
accumulators of their individual skill
 
04:27:52.130 --> 04:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
sets in order to try to get employment
 
04:27:54.130 --> 04:27:54.140 align:start position:0%
could we not be
 
04:27:56.809 --> 04:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
disadvantaging students who don't want
 
04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
to use those in creating a bit of a
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive there that students
 
04:28:03.769 --> 04:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
have to use these sites in order to be
 
04:28:03.779 --> 04:28:06.110 align:start position:0%
have to use these sites in order to be
competitive

04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
well that's the question I I think this
 
04:28:11.210 --> 04:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
is essentially enabling of a student or
 
04:28:14.570 --> 04:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
their parent says no
 
04:28:16.610 --> 04:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
that's where that's where it is what
 
04:28:19.010 --> 04:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
what I was concerned with this one is
 
04:28:20.929 --> 04:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
that you know being deeply invested in
 
04:28:22.370 --> 04:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
career and Tech education and in
 
04:28:24.050 --> 04:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
Workforce and providing opportunities
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
for our for our high school students
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
that um we don't have something that
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
prevents them from being able to post
 
04:28:33.410 --> 04:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
their credentials or to access things
 
04:28:35.929 --> 04:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
that would be would help them with an
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
employer or help them with their
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
certification so I you know I I uh I
 
04:28:44.570 --> 04:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
worry about that I in that you know we
 
04:28:45.649 --> 04:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
want to make sure students have the
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity but it is finally A Parent's
 
04:28:48.950 --> 04:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
Choice isn't it or a student's choice if
 
04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do something we it
 
04:28:52.689 --> 04:28:52.699 align:start position:0%
just doesn't force them
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
just real quick just to clarify I just
 
04:28:56.450 --> 04:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
want to make sure because I I'm not
 
04:28:57.769 --> 04:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
familiar with the entirety of this law
 
04:28:59.630 --> 04:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in current law that
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
would prohibit a student or parents from
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
doing that on their own is there
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh no but you know if you're some of
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
this these educational
 
04:29:11.570 --> 04:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
um curricula you're using in the school
 
04:29:14.210 --> 04:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
okay Adobe or
 
04:29:15.410 --> 04:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's some amazing things
 
04:29:17.689 --> 04:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
that came out of covert where you can do
 
04:29:20.269 --> 04:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
medical procedures online with you know
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
virtual reality or work on a car
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
um but then the engineering one is
 
04:29:26.510 --> 04:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's a really great some really great

description of cordelli thank you
 
04:29:36.110 --> 04:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters do you know if this would
 
04:29:40.969 --> 04:29:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:44.330 --> 04:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
um whereby a person gets a digital badge
 
04:29:46.010 --> 04:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
and you get
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
um badges included in your folder for
 
04:29:51.530 --> 04:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
certain performance tasks or
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
certifications or so forth because I I
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
have concerns about digital badging and
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
have had it on my list for a couple of
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
years to look at legislation in that
 
04:30:07.010 --> 04:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
regard because of uh concerns about
 
04:30:07.020 --> 04:30:07.790 align:start position:0%
regard because of uh concerns about
um

04:30:07.790 --> 04:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:10.250 --> 04:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily know who's posting
 
04:30:14.349 --> 04:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
a badge for you being able to
 
04:30:17.809 --> 04:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
object to something or modify something
 
04:30:19.969 --> 04:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
Etc I think or issues to be looked at
 
04:30:22.490 --> 04:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
with digital badging so I'm not sure if
 
04:30:24.110 --> 04:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
really this would Encompass digital
 
04:30:26.330 --> 04:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
badging or not I don't know if that has
 
04:30:28.250 --> 04:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
come up in any conversations you've had
 
04:30:30.410 --> 04:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
on this that's a question no it hasn't
 
04:30:33.530 --> 04:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
and um you know great question and I I'm
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
not sure whether it's really relevant
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
particularly to this but I think it's a
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
great question to ask the attorneys or
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
at or if you ask Jeff beard he'll get it
 
04:30:47.450 --> 04:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
to the attorneys and and see because
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you know here we wrote you
 
04:30:53.090 --> 04:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
know Neil Kirk and I and John Reagan
 
04:30:54.410 --> 04:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
wrote a great Bill a few years ago and
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
then then who to think that social media
 
04:30:59.210 --> 04:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
changes huh so we gotta we gotta make
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
sure we're protecting our kids and
 
04:31:02.450 --> 04:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
keeping up yeah now you're hanging about
 
04:31:02.460 --> 04:31:04.429 align:start position:0%
keeping up yeah now you're hanging about
AI

04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
AI
 
04:31:06.290 --> 04:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
I could use some of that artificial
 
04:31:10.450 --> 04:31:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:12.649 --> 04:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:31:12.659 --> 04:31:13.849 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:31:13.849 --> 04:31:13.859 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:31:13.859 --> 04:31:14.570 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:31:14.570 --> 04:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:18.010 --> 04:31:18.020 align:start position:0%
when when some of the the the
 
04:31:21.290 --> 04:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
clamp down on using social media
 
04:31:23.570 --> 04:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
happened in in schools
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I had quite a conversation with a
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
local school that I represent and they
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
do they use uh they have a graphic
 
04:31:34.370 --> 04:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
design class that they use Adobe they
 
04:31:36.649 --> 04:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
had a drafting class where they used
 
04:31:40.189 --> 04:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
online drafting tools uh things like
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
that and when that law went through they
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
thought they couldn't use them and it
 
04:31:49.130 --> 04:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
seems and so I appreciate that you have
 
04:31:51.050 --> 04:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
this bill coming through I'm just
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if if uh it sounds like you're
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose or the whole
 
04:32:00.710 --> 04:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
um Initiative for this bill was through
 
04:32:02.929 --> 04:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
the Career and Technical the CTE centers
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm just thinking uh could
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh the public schools that have uh that
 
04:32:13.250 --> 04:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
want to use Adobe use the same type in
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
it for a career uh the same type of
 
04:32:18.290 --> 04:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
thing with teacher supervision with uh
 
04:32:18.300 --> 04:32:19.250 align:start position:0%
thing with teacher supervision with uh
parent

04:32:19.250 --> 04:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
um opt-in on that that's the question
 
04:32:23.389 --> 04:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
and I I think that you know I I did
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
speak about ctes but this is meant to be
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
a little broader than that that's why on
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
line eight career exploration or career
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
in technical education
 
04:32:32.040 --> 04:32:32.929 align:start position:0%
in technical education
um

04:32:32.929 --> 04:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
and uh the the example you gave is just
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
the problem that some superintendents
 
04:32:40.250 --> 04:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
were looking at the statute which we had
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
thought allowed them their students to
 
04:32:44.570 --> 04:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
use the curriculum they wanted and
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the statute and
 
04:32:49.370 --> 04:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
saying well you look over here and we're
 
04:32:51.969 --> 04:32:51.979 align:start position:0%
a little nervous about it so basically
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is it's not housekeeping bill but
 
04:32:56.210 --> 04:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
basically what it does is to make sure
 
04:32:58.849 --> 04:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
especially by going into
 
04:32:58.859 --> 04:32:59.649 align:start position:0%
especially by going into
um

04:32:59.649 --> 04:32:59.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:59.659 --> 04:33:01.250 align:start position:0%
um
189

04:33:01.250 --> 04:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
189
 
04:33:01.260 --> 04:33:01.929 align:start position:0%
189
um

04:33:01.929 --> 04:33:01.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
66 instead of 70. we think that this
 
04:33:06.650 --> 04:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
addresses the concerns the
 
04:33:08.510 --> 04:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
superintendents were having over what
 
04:33:09.769 --> 04:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
was permissible
 
04:33:11.209 --> 04:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
04:33:13.320 --> 04:33:14.449 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
representative

04:33:14.449 --> 04:33:14.459 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you just um
 
04:33:19.010 --> 04:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
technical question
 
04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
is this amendment the only part of the
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
amendment or is this just to amend the
 
04:33:24.240 --> 04:33:26.869 align:start position:0%
amendment or is this just to amend the
amendment

04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:33:29.929 --> 04:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
um if you uh look at the the original
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
Bill yep
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
um as passed by the as amended by the
 
04:33:34.080 --> 04:33:35.209 align:start position:0%
um as passed by the as amended by the
Senate

04:33:35.209 --> 04:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.320 --> 04:33:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:45.051 --> 04:33:45.061 align:start position:0%
paragraph two the amendment just
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
replaces that part but the first part is
 
04:33:49.010 --> 04:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
still in the first few lines are still
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
in the bill yeah so it says Amendment
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill by replacing section two with the
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
following so just that just that second
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
an option Damon
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:34:01.439 --> 04:34:02.570 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

04:34:02.570 --> 04:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering in the amendment has
 
04:34:08.689 --> 04:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
left out what in the bill from the
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
Senate is the end of line 13 and 14. so
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
such technology and services shall have
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
a direct connection to the content areas
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
of study that seems like a valuable
 
04:34:22.849 --> 04:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
statement yeah thinking that that's
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
covered because it says it's part of the
 
04:34:28.970 --> 04:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.980 --> 04:34:29.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:34:29.769 --> 04:34:29.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:33.769 --> 04:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
yes uh what we thought was that by
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
moving into this other section
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
and by including
 
04:34:38.879 --> 04:34:39.949 align:start position:0%
and by including
um

04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:42.650 --> 04:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
in line three of the amendment data
 
04:34:46.250 --> 04:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
inventory and policies publication
 
04:34:48.051 --> 04:34:48.061 align:start position:0%
um that that line was no longer
 
04:34:48.061 --> 04:34:50.869 align:start position:0%
um that that line was no longer
necessary

04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.730 --> 04:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
so this is what this is what the
 
04:34:55.010 --> 04:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
attorney at the doe said we we've got it
 
04:34:56.689 --> 04:34:56.699 align:start position:0%
covered now that line is no longer
 
04:34:56.699 --> 04:34:57.830 align:start position:0%
covered now that line is no longer
necessary

04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
because you know it's where we have
 
04:35:02.330 --> 04:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
areas of study
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and uh they want a program of study
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
on line seven so they said by making
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
program study it that is what replaces
 
04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
such technology direct connection to the
 
04:35:17.570 --> 04:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
content areas of study and this actually
 
04:35:19.010 --> 04:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
tightens it up a bit my same program
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
study instead of areas because areas
 
04:35:22.970 --> 04:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
gets kind of loose so that that's that's
 
04:35:25.250 --> 04:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
why that that's why attorney did it the
 
04:35:29.631 --> 04:35:29.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
04:35:34.609 --> 04:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
committee for Senator Waters
 
04:35:36.289 --> 04:35:36.299 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Mr chairman remember
 
04:35:43.730 --> 04:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
is there any I I don't have any other
 
04:35:49.010 --> 04:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
pink cards here
 
04:35:51.769 --> 04:35:51.779 align:start position:0%
is there any more information that may
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
be needed on this
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
for us to gather and and be looking at
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment to
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
does the department have anything for us
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
Diana no no
 
04:36:05.160 --> 04:36:06.709 align:start position:0%
Diana no no
okay

04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
so with that in the CTE advisory Council
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
I know the CTE centers have been
 
04:36:14.090 --> 04:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
complaining about this the whole time
 
04:36:15.890 --> 04:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
I've been there because they can't
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
access the students can't access what
 
04:36:19.730 --> 04:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
they need to
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
especially sometimes if they've gone
 
04:36:23.209 --> 04:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
through the whole program and then they
 
04:36:24.890 --> 04:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
can't access it to get their credential
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
so it's been a big problem and I think a
 
04:36:29.810 --> 04:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
lot of it's been the I.T directors in
 
04:36:32.631 --> 04:36:32.641 align:start position:0%
the in the districts too have had a
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
problem with it so and this will be very
 
04:36:34.439 --> 04:36:36.289 align:start position:0%
problem with it so and this will be very
helpful

04:36:36.289 --> 04:36:36.299 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:36:36.299 --> 04:36:38.631 align:start position:0%
helpful
yeah

04:36:38.631 --> 04:36:38.641 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay so with that if there's no more
 
04:36:44.810 --> 04:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
discussion yes well we're not into a
 
04:36:46.970 --> 04:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
discussion there's no but he also wants
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
to present I guess you know our hearing
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing is going to be closed
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
if if you want to talk a little bit
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
about this later we can
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
um okay so with that I'm going to close
 
04:37:02.209 --> 04:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
the hearing on on SBE 213 so that closes
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
that is there anybody had a question
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
about that bill though or wants to
 
04:37:09.410 --> 04:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
discussed a little bit are we good
 
04:37:09.420 --> 04:37:12.109 align:start position:0%
discussed a little bit are we good
yeah

04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
I would just
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
the the part in the bold letters here is
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
kind of flashing red signals for me
 
04:37:20.689 --> 04:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that just knowing
 
04:37:22.490 --> 04:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
the way things tend to work if we enable
 
04:37:24.650 --> 04:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
social media companies to begin
 
04:37:26.330 --> 04:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
collecting these these pieces of
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
information for students that are then
 
04:37:30.289 --> 04:37:30.299 align:start position:0%
going to be trying to use for employment
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
purposes that that that's going to place
 
04:37:36.289 --> 04:37:36.299 align:start position:0%
these students entirely at the mercy of
 
04:37:37.730 --> 04:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
these social media companies when it
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
comes to trying to obtain employment and
 
04:37:41.929 --> 04:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
that opens the door to all sorts of
 
04:37:43.609 --> 04:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
control mechanisms that I don't think we
 
04:37:47.929 --> 04:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.810 --> 04:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay so there's one you know perspective
 
04:37:53.689 --> 04:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
that we might want to consider
 
04:37:53.699 --> 04:37:54.650 align:start position:0%
that we might want to consider
um

04:37:54.650 --> 04:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:57.170 --> 04:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
is there any way you could rewrite that
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.269 --> 04:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
Diana could you convey to Jeff that
 
04:38:08.449 --> 04:38:08.459 align:start position:0%
there may be some concern with that line
 
04:38:11.810 --> 04:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
six seven and the bill
 
04:38:11.820 --> 04:38:18.949 align:start position:0%
six seven and the bill
mm-hmm

04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.250 --> 04:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay I guess with that we are done for
 
04:38:22.260 --> 04:38:25.369 align:start position:0%
okay I guess with that we are done for
today

04:38:25.369 --> 04:38:25.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.090 --> 04:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:49.250 --> 04:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
yeah the 11th would be the
 
04:38:55.490 --> 04:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
next scheduled meeting I haven't
 
04:39:00.609 --> 04:39:00.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd yeah a question do you
 
04:39:05.209 --> 04:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
know how many more Senate bills we have
 
04:39:08.631 --> 04:39:08.641 align:start position:0%
for our public hearings the the bills
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
which we have are the ones that we
 
04:39:13.250 --> 04:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
scheduled for today and the other day
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
right so with that there's two bills
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
that we haven't heard one from last
 
04:39:21.650 --> 04:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
night yesterday afternoon and then 272.
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's it that's enough but I I was like
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
expecting a whole other day so what we
 
04:39:30.051 --> 04:39:30.061 align:start position:0%
would do so now once we get those done
 
04:39:31.449 --> 04:39:31.459 align:start position:0%
we exactly
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
and then what we do is we look it's you
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
know we won't be doing 266 until we have
 
04:39:41.330 --> 04:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
more work groups on that then we exec
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
and after we finish doing that we're
 
04:39:45.170 --> 04:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at the retained
 
04:39:48.170 --> 04:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
bills which we have
 
04:39:50.090 --> 04:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
and we got to go back to those and I can
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
tell you how many retaining bills we
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:56.810 --> 04:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
we don't really have to act on them
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
until the fall not till the fall but if
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's some retain bills which we want
 
04:40:03.170 --> 04:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
to have work sessions for subgroups
 
04:40:05.090 --> 04:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
committee groups that's when we set
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
those up and stride it start working on
 
04:40:10.430 --> 04:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:40:17.040 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
sure
