00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
um the bill is is very well intended the
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
the bill is intended to
 
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
um to encourage to encourage businesses
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
to provide an extra level of protection
 
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
in their buildings and then give them
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
relief for doing that however uh there's
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
still some technical aspects of the bill
 
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
that need to be worked out and each time
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
it seems like we have an amendment ready
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
to go to do that we find that Pandora's
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
Box hasn't been quite closed again and
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
it uh it prized itself open so at this
 
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
time it's best to itl the bill and we'll
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
figure out something better uh in
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
another time so thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
you is it further discussion
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'd like to
 
00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:56.570 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'd like to
um

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
agree that it's well intentioned
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
um but so feedback for
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor if the sponsor hears this
 
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.809 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor if the sponsor hears this
um

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.370 align:start position:0%
um
specifically

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
um one
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
one concern was whether
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
um this would apply to
 
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.089 align:start position:0%
um this would apply to
um

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
places that are required by law to
 
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
places that are required by law to
install

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
install
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
fire suppression systems anyways so
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't really want a tax credit
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
for people just doing what they have to
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
do anyways so um
 
00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:36.979 align:start position:0%
if the prime sponsor could
 
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539 align:start position:0%
take a look into that
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
we might be able to
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
um work something out for the next time
 
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
um work something out for the next time
around

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:50.580 align:start position:0%

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is an expansion
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm not
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
um sure is warranted and
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
um it is just another way of uh
 
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.769 align:start position:0%
um it is just another way of uh
transferring

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
transferring
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
um the tax burden to the the
 
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.269 align:start position:0%
um the tax burden to the the
um

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
from from businesses to the
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
um people of the community trying to uh
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
trying to afford their tax bills so I
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
think that for those reasons I I think
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
that we should I tell this I think
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative further discussion
 
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester thank you Mr
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
chair I would be opposing itl this is
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that we can enhance the
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
housing as well as giving the relief
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
that where relief is needed and you know
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
revitalizing and building density and
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
more housing for folks is
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
critical at this time so this is
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
another tool in the toolbox so I would
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
oppose itl
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I also will be
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
opposing the itl motion economic
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
revitalization of our downtowns is a key
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
priority for New Hampshire
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and as opposed to passing tax burdens
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
from businesses to
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
resident taxpayers I suppose is what
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
when you rehabilitate a dilapidated
 
00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
ignored crumbling property you generate
 
00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:45.710 align:start position:0%
ignored crumbling property you generate
Revenue

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
so this would be a very good thing for
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
our towns and cities that have downtowns
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
that are blighted and the blight doesn't
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
always come from structures it sometimes
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
comes from the area around the
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
structures so I think that this bill
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
would be a very good measure for the
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
state to adopt thank you thank you
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative representative Gallagher
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to note that um I

and representative Cahill would you like
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes I think this
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
is a good bill and and gives um local
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
control back to the people when making
 
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
decisions or what's going on in their
 
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.390 align:start position:0%
decisions or what's going on in their
town

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative majority
 
00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
I I have respect for everybody in this
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
room and especially representative
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
Cahill but disagree in the strongest
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
possible way that this gives back local
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
control what this does is requires a
 
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
special meeting for an emergent
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
situation how is there any control
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
possible in that kind of circumstance
 
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
you would need weeks if not months to be
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
able to take care of an emergent
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
situation in your town you need local
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
control and this rests it away so I I
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
disagree and will not support the OTP
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.090 align:start position:0%

I strongly agree with my colleague
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Maggiore that this takes
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
away local control from municipalities
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
because if you have to order a boil
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
water a boil water order people might be
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
dead before they could get to a public
 
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.289 align:start position:0%
dead before they could get to a public
meeting

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%

previous two uh
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative and I totally opposed
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
this by taking away the local control
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
especially in an emergency we just come
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
out of uh pandemic where this was
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
displayed a key role for the
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have that ability to
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
make decisions and this will not provide
 
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.260 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
that with that I will
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%

we'll be writing the committee report
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
H will open the exact session on
 
00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:26.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative I'll make a motion to
 
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.029 align:start position:0%
representative I'll make a motion to
retain

00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
we need to uh I think that like do some
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment on the language and and and
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh do some uh more understanding about
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
what what the actual impact will be so
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that retain is uh is
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
the proper motion thank you
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.210 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
discussion

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
of some Gallagher
 
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.029 align:start position:0%
of some Gallagher
um

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
um on the lines of doing
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
further work on it um
 
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.390 align:start position:0%
further work on it um
I

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
um was under the impression that there
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
would be an amendment to this so I'm
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
wondering if we want to do further work
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
on it if maybe we could
 
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment first and then
 
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
we can't cannot do that we have a motion
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
on the floor to retain I will say once a
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
bill is retained amendments and further
 
00:27:56.289 --> 00:27:56.299 align:start position:0%
work can be
 
00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:58.190 align:start position:0%
work can be
addressed

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
while it's retained anyway so
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
um further comments on this I have a
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
couple if you
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
I just want to say uh for myself the
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
main reason I I prefer to see this
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
retain is
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
the discussion and the
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
the testimony given
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
um for myself very confusing I know I'm
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
new to the committee we also have many
 
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:24.740 align:start position:0%
other new committee members here
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
and before I I feel comfortable voting
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
either direction I want to totally
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
understand it so I
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
thought the best best option at its time
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
would be to to retain it and get further
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
work that might clarify a little bit of
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
the language or make make things a
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
little easier to understand for some of
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
us so that was my reason for retaining
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Davis
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll be supporting
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain although I have
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
spoken with both sponsors of the bill
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
about the amendment that I sent to OLS
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
the other day and distributed to the
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
committee yesterday and they are in
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
agreement with that Amendment so I would
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
urge our committee to take that into
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
consideration when we further study the
 
00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:14.330 align:start position:0%
consideration when we further study the
bill

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%

the next
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh exact bill that
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
is shown we're going to actually
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
I'll have to technically call it recess
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
it to the end of this today or whatever
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
we're waiting on uh an amendment that's
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
OLS promises is going to be here so I'd
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
like to wait on HP 51 until that arrives
 
00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
so we will go ahead and exact open the
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
exact session then on HP 313 reductions
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
in the default budget
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
and let's see we asked
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
for emotion motion ought to pass
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative yokella moves 313
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass representative power
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh Second Step motion representative
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
yokella would you like to speak
 
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.990 align:start position:0%
yokella would you like to speak
sure

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
um this is uh my build that I presented
 
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee and all it's doing is
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
allowing uh the default budget to
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
reflect the newly hired position uh when
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
there is turnover within uh an existing
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
budget so that
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
um it's the default budget is more
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
reflective of the actual status on the
 
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
ground at the time of the the public
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
hearing so
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
of the new of the new uh proposed budget
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative majority
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm going to uh I'm
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the the ought to pass
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
and would prefer itl uh while I
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
understand certainly understand where
 
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:10.460 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor wants to go with this
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
if there is a position that is unfilled
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
at that time through turnover having the
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
ability to keep that position open with
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
the full funding or the funding for that
 
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:24.260 align:start position:0%
position is critical to communities
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
should that go to the default budget
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
with some change for instance if the
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
position is unfilled then it goes to the
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
default budget I assume as a zero and
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
therefore the community would be unable
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
to fill that position because you would
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
have no money for it so I think while
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
while the idea is well intended I think
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
the consequence could be detrimental to
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I agree with Excuse me my
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
fellow representative majority I think
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
this is another bill or another RSA
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's been jiggled with uh many many
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
times including my attempt many years
 
00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:06.409 align:start position:0%
times including my attempt many years
ago

00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
um I think that in today's uh climate
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
where it's becoming harder and harder to
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
fill positions I know we have several in
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
our public works department that have
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
been empty for almost a year and I've
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
heard that from several other
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
communities that leaving the um the
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
empty position at the at the salary
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
range that it was occur originally
 
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.610 align:start position:0%
range that it was occur originally
um

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
budget of that will give us the
 
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explore different levels
 
00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:41.930 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explore different levels
of

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
applicants and so we're not always going
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
to get an applicant that is less
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
qualified or younger or doesn't need
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
health insurance so I think leaving that
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
um that spot at in the budget as it was
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
was proposed for the year or proposed
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
from the year before too uh that we have
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
more flexibility in answering our
 
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.630 align:start position:0%
more flexibility in answering our
problems

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.389 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative

um Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:10.730 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
um a question that I have is a
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
procedural are we allowed to ask the
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor a clarifying question on what
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
was brought up by uh representative
 
00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:21.470 align:start position:0%
was brought up by uh representative
majority

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%

majority
no

00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
um okay you you are you may ask somebody
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
who's spoken
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
a question they are not required to
 
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.950 align:start position:0%
a question they are not required to
answer

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
as so Mr chairman can I ask
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative vocala a question
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
you can ask he is not required to answer
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
so if you want to go ahead and ask the
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
question go ahead representative you
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
call I'd just like to get a
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
clarification on that my understanding
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
of the language of the bill was that
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
um if there was a proposed position that
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
money could be put into the default
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
budget is that true or not thank you
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
if you want to answer go ahead thank you
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for asking the
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
question I completely agree that
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
um that a vacant position is not
 
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
turnover like turnover is when the the
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
definition that I'm using is that the
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
that turnover is when you previously had
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
a person and now you have a new person
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
that is turnover if you had a person
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
before and now you don't have a person
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
that isn't turnover yet until you
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
actually completed the process of hiring
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
a new person and so until the hiring
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
process has occurred then there would be
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
no change to the default budget and so I
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
completely I understand the fear of some
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
of the the members but I I don't believe
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
that is is neither the intent of the
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
bill nor I don't believe the application
 
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
bill nor I don't believe the application
but

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
if if uh definition of turnover meaning
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
needed to be you know clarified you know
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
in the senate or whatever to say that
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
the turnover means the hiring of an the
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
of a new employee that is completely
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
amenable to me so thank you thanks
 
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.109 align:start position:0%
amenable to me so thank you thanks
representative

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative status
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I know we all have a
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
lot to remember these days
 
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
but I would like to remind my colleagues
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
on the community that we voted to retain
 
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
that dealt with difficulties in hiring
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
staff and turnover issues with the bill
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the deputy Town Clerks and so I
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand the logic of
 
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
italing this
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
the motion is actually
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
ought to pass my apologies
 
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
ought to pass my apologies
representative

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my concern is when we
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
are in such a tight Market you know at
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
the county level at the municipality
 
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.310 align:start position:0%
the county level at the municipality
level

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
this is going to take away a tool that
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and the
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
towns have
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
in order to you know you can't time a
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
turnover or you can't time when the
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
person is going to leave and there's so
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
much effort and time and money spent on
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
retaining and retraining and uh
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
and this will hinder that if it is not
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
perfectly timed by the time the budget
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
happens and just after the budget you
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
hire somebody you have to go back to put
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
that money back into that so just I
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
think looking at what we have in this
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
situation right now
 
00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.270 align:start position:0%
situation right now
Workforce

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
Development High you know Workforce is
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
such acute shortage and this will only
 
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.250 align:start position:0%
such acute shortage and this will only
affect

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
putting a good budget so I will oppose
 
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so we can keep that tool
 
00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:22.579 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities need thank you
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
yes the whole um discussion of the
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
default budget is I feel there's a lot
 
00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:35.870 align:start position:0%
default budget is I feel there's a lot
of

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:38.540 align:start position:0%
frustration on the part of taxpayers
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
that they go into the voting booth and
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
vote against a budget
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
that they feel is too high
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
and if that budget fails
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
the fallback position which is the
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
default budget in many cases is higher
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
than the than the budget that they just
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
voted against so
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
I am in favor
 
00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:08.829 align:start position:0%
I am in favor
of

00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
changing the formula
 
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:14.180 align:start position:0%
for the default budget
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
to more adequately reflect the intent
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
of what the default budget should be
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
which is a fallback position in case the
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
operating budget fails so in my case I I
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a perfect bill but
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of it
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative majori
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I I agree I agree with my friend from
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
across the aisle on what you're saying
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
and I agree with the prime sponsor still
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
in in what the goal is but I think the
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
language and creates a question and has
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
with my own Financial director say and
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
he brought up two or three examples of
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
well what if and I couldn't answer it I
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
know exactly where you want to go I just
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
don't I think this bill is going to
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
leave some question marks which are yet
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
unanswered if they can be answered if
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
this bill were to get to the Senate I
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
think we would have something better but

bill is very vague and I will be voting
 
00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass and will be
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
opting for to retain this bill so this
 
00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:42.619 align:start position:0%
can be clarified
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%

yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
this is a fantastic bill
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
um that brings all of our counties in
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
line together as Stratford county is the
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
only County without districts and uh
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
this is a fantastic bill and I move to
 
00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:53.270 align:start position:0%
this is a fantastic bill and I move to
octopaths

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
octopaths
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
there's a very very little that is
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
consistent about our counties and far
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
from bringing our counties into
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
consistency and together I think this
 
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.050 align:start position:0%
consistency and together I think this
bill

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:08.060 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
divides Republicans and Democrats in a
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunate and I I think that what we
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
see and what we have seen traditionally
 
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
on this Committee in particular is
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats working
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
together for the betterment of the
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state and I see this
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill as a partisan divisive
 
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
issue and I will be voting against it
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the comments
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.150 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
um so

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to note that um I followed
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
up on my question about the distance
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
between the tip of Madbury and
 
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
um the next County over Rockingham
 
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
um the next County over Rockingham
County

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
um with a geographer and found out that
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
that is in fact an example of point
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
contiguity and even if Point continuity
 
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.370 align:start position:0%
contiguity and even if Point continuity
May

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
May
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
technically be legal I still find it to
 
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
be in extremely bad taste and think it's
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
sure it makes an example of
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering so um I am going to
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
oppose the
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
and oppose the motion of OTP on this
 
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.849 align:start position:0%
and oppose the motion of OTP on this
bill

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:46:30.849 --> 00:46:30.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion yes
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
one of the worst things that can happen
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
in my mind in a representative democracy
 
00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:43.220 align:start position:0%
is to feel as if your vote doesn't count
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
we had significant testimony when we
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
went through from the rule rural
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
portions of the county that they just
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
didn't feel as if their vote counted
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
that the cities were because of the
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
population dispersions the city's
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed the rural portions and it it
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
meant that the these people
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
were frustrated that they just didn't
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
have the the the vote so
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
when you do redistricting it is
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
inherently political you can't take the
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
politics out of it so to and I respect
 
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.490 align:start position:0%
politics out of it so to and I respect
my

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
colleague Representatives Davis who who
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
said that this is a a a a very partisan
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
effort here and I don't disagree with
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
that because it is redistricting
 
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:54.740 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to representative
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
Gallagher's uh discussion of the
 
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.670 align:start position:0%
Gallagher's uh discussion of the
contiguity

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
contiguity
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
it is it meets the the Constitutional
 
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
definition of contiguous so I don't see
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
that that is a valid argument so I will
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
be supporting the OTP here and hopefully
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
these people in the rural portions of
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
the county will will feel as if their
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
vote matters
 
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:31.309 align:start position:0%
vote matters
foreign

00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sorry for my
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
chartiness I was driving around the
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
block but not for two hours
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I am not in support of this bill for
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
a number of reasons and I heard from
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
many constituents at least a dozen via
 
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
email and voicemail messages and phone
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
conversations who are all residents of
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
Stratford County
 
00:48:55.619 --> 00:48:58.250 align:start position:0%
Stratford County
feeling

00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
that this is not an appropriate time to
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
do this redistricting first of all that
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
this um this effort is not transparent
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
and really not although we did hear from
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
people just as my friend representative
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
LaSalle said we did hear from people in
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
the more rural parts of the county that
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
they were dissatisfied
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear from everyone and we did
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
we've now heard from more people now
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
that the bill is out
 
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.790 align:start position:0%
that the bill is out
um

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
transparency is what I'm hearing and
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that's not happening right now the
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
second part that I've been hearing is
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
how can we be redistricting a county
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
here in the state legislature
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
when it's
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
it it's not the right times is what
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
people are saying to me the um the fact
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we've just had the census done
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
and it will be another
 
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
several years till a new census is done
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the appropriate time to
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
put in a measure that would redistrict
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
Stratford County to potentially meet the
 
00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.470 align:start position:0%
Stratford County to potentially meet the
um

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
same standards as our other Counties
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
have the other part that I'm hearing is
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
Stratford county is unique in the fact
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
that it is the smallest one of the
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
smallest counties that we have
 
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
and yet it's the fourth most populated
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
county and we haven't spoken to enough
 
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.140 align:start position:0%
or listened to enough of our
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
constituents to get a true picture of
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
what it is they're looking for
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I will not be in support of this bill
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to read you
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
all the emails that I got from people
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
but they are basically saying what I've
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
just said it needs to be a transparent
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
process the people need to have lots
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
more input than they've had and the
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
decision needs to be
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
um much broader and right now we're not
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
there that's all I'll say for now thank
 
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.309 align:start position:0%
there that's all I'll say for now thank
you

00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will Echo some of
 
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
the same sentiments uh my colleague just
 
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
spoke and this we heard from other
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from other counties and
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
from my county that says you know we
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
have heard it several times making
 
00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.609 align:start position:0%
have heard it several times making
um

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
comment about taking a bite of the Apple
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
twice and this is one example where the
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting the Statewide
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission did all those
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
things for the 2020
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
um you know between 2020 and 2022 and
 
00:51:52.089 --> 00:51:52.099 align:start position:0%
just because it didn't match up to what
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
uh some of the voters in that county
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
felt uh disenfranchised to say that
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to redistrict just that
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
county for just that purpose is taking a
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
second bite just because
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
um you can do it so I think the
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
transparency the Democratic process and
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
also making it more partisan all the way
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
down to the local level where several
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who spoke said it's a
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
non-partisan issue the voters selected
 
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and if the density of
 
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.170 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and if the density of
population

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:35.180 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
that happens to be in the cities where
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
it that's where it is in the economic
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
engine is from these densely populated
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh part of the county so are these
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
Waters less of a choice just because
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
they pay more taxes or contribute I just
 
00:53:03.609 --> 00:53:03.619 align:start position:0%
don't get it so just trying to make this
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
divisiveness I will oppose the art pass
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
this has to wait for the next redistrict
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
chairman with all due respect I I
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
disagree with the notion that this bill
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
is about redistricting
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's putting in place
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
districts at the county level and in New
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire All Counties have three
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I see this as I said it's
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's about putting in districts and it's
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
about how these Commissioners are voted
 
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.430 align:start position:0%
about how these Commissioners are voted
upon

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
currently it's at large versus
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
the voters within a district which don't
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
yet exist being able to elect the
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner for their District
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
and furthermore redistricting has to do
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
with apportionment
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
of Voters and representation
 
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.770 align:start position:0%
of Voters and representation
um

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
The Spill to me is not that
 
00:54:07.319 --> 00:54:09.290 align:start position:0%
The Spill to me is not that
representative

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I feel like I'm
 
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
having deja vu all over again
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
the chair kindly offered to work on a
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
newer version or a different version of
 
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
a bill that came before this committee
 
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
that was sponsored by me earlier and I
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
think I'm making the same request of him
 
00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:29.390 align:start position:0%
think I'm making the same request of him
now

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
I feel as though we have a difference of
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
opinion amongst us as as to whether this
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
constitutes redistricting and therefore
 
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
can the Apple be bitten again and I
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
think the answer is probably no to that
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh but clearly there are people in this
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
County who feel disenfranchised that's a
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
bad thing I agree with my called week
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
there has to be a way of fixing this
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
problem for counties across New
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's one of the things we as a
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
committee grapple with over and over and
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
over again and I wonder if this might be
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to retain and really take
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
um so as to the question of whether this
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
is redistricting or not uh I think this
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
bill has two separate parts one is to
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
say that Stratford County shall have
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
districts and then the other is to
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually draw those districts and I'm
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
just questioning why we have to do those
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
two things combined like I think another
 
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
possible solution is if we just
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
want Safford County have districts we
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
could say
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
Trafford County Sheriff districts which
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
will then be drawn by an independent
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission or which shall
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
then be drawn by the county delegation
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
or the County Commissioners but instead
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're drawing those districts ourselves
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
here which I think shows that this is in
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
fact redistricting rather than one of
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
um would it be okay if I asked the prime
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
sponsor a question
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor will speak after
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
and if I don't answer your question
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.410 align:start position:0%
after that
sure

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
um one I would actually
 
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:38.780 align:start position:0%
um be in support of retaining this bill
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
because if you look at the other
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
sections about how County
 
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.130 align:start position:0%
sections about how County
um

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:45.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
Commissioners sorry elected it's kind of
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
a flip of this bill where the the
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
district is defined and then the terms
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the county officials and how they're
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
voted comes after that and we've been
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
changing the Commissioners slowly but
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
surely to four-year terms so that might
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
also be a consideration here and
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
describe how they're voted uh you know
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
which commission has the four-year term
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
first and then the others would be two
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
and one or something like that so I I
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
would vote to retain on retain this to
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh I can't say oh rep uh sorry
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative wrong go ahead that's
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair I'm just
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
wondering why there's no fiscal note on
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
this bill because there would be a cost
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
to the county to to form those districts
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
and set up the election things like that
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
I I would think there'd at least be a
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.359 --> 00:57:50.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of my friends who live in these
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
rural areas in Stratford County when
 
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
they heard what was happening was very
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
alarmed they're independent voters
 
00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:07.609 align:start position:0%
alarmed they're independent voters
um

00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
and they said there's a better process
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
of doing this and they didn't feel like
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
there were not being heard or
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
represented they instead they did feel
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
like their existing system
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
existing Commissioners we're hearing
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
them and we're representing the entire
 
00:58:24.599 --> 00:58:25.549 align:start position:0%
them and we're representing the entire
County

00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
for the whole welfare of the county but
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
they felt like if this was needed there
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
would be there should be a time where
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
there the residents event uh independent
 
00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
commission would come up with the
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
boundaries for the three Commissioners
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
instead of having it done in this
 
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
instead of having it done in this
committee

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Representatives Davis
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair could you refresh my memory do
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor we have a
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
can we vote on that motion and then
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
we still have people making comments
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative treeleven
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my Mike's been on
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
this whole time good thing I was quiet
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I forgot to mention uh
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
two of the folks who contacted me
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
said why is this in front of our
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
committee and I had that question as
 
00:59:27.839 --> 00:59:29.270 align:start position:0%
committee and I had that question as
well

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
um Municipal and County government the
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
name of our committee might make sense
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
yet these people both asked me why it
 
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
wasn't in election law since those folks
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
have more experience with that that's
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
all thanks thank you for the comments
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'll make a few and answer
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
the first point of this bill and
 
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman kind of talked
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
about how it appears to be reversed it's
 
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
just the way I believe the rsas are
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
written and that's how olus wrote it up
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues that myself and the
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
vice chair and I assuming most on this
 
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
committee are concerned with and that's
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
consistency and in one of the rsas
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
contained in the bill it says starts out
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
except for Stratford County
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on in that IRS say to
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
delineate every other County and their
 
01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.289 align:start position:0%
delineate every other County and their
districts

01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's the first point
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
second point a person apportionment
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
versus districting or redistricting
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
apportionment is the 10-year
 
01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.470 align:start position:0%
apportionment is the 10-year
um

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
we do every 10 year after the census
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
numbers are given this past term we were
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
very delayed on the census and the
 
01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.490 align:start position:0%
very delayed on the census and the
district

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:48.500 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
redistricting was quite a bit delayed
 
01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.770 align:start position:0%
redistricting was quite a bit delayed
um

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:53.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
apportionment is when they take the
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
numbers they assign them to a town or
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
Ward or whatever and then
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
the districts are redrawn using those
 
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.770 align:start position:0%
the districts are redrawn using those
numbers

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.789 align:start position:0%
numbers
um

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
I heard talk about a lot of emails I too
 
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
got a lot of emails from people all over
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
the county including the city saying
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
this somebody asked about why this
 
01:01:24.119 --> 01:01:25.609 align:start position:0%
this somebody asked about why this
committee

01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
I would ask the same thing
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
um as you know well some of you know I
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
was on the redistricting committee for
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
the State uh for the
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
in the house last term
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
and um all of that went through
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
the election law I will say in 2006
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
there was a bill put forth similar to
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
this where they tried to put districts
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
into Stratford County and that came that
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
was also before this committee as to why
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
it was assigned here I don't have a a
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
the next thing this is not redistricting
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
this is a districting of the county
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
I've heard we have we heard the
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Stratford County last
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
week testified that this was
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because of
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
apportionment and redistricting he was
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
either totally in error not knowing the
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
law and the Constitution or he was maybe
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
attempting to mislead this committee it
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
is not in fact I went to the Secretary
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
of State yesterday and had a discussion
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
on HB 270 and he said indeed what you
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
were doing is not only lawful and
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
Constitution but he understands it I
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
asked him about redistricting versus
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
District he said this is not a
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting you were more than
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
I brought a little prop today I just
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to show you
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
so you have an idea when I I think I
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
spoke last week when we were talking
 
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
about the redistricting committee about
 
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
the legalities the constitutionality
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
when we were on the redistricting
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
committee last year this is the book we
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
were given and this this delineates all
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
the U.S constant U.S Supreme Court
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
decisions on
 
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.089 align:start position:0%
decisions on
redistricting

01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
I couldn't find one in here that even
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
deals with Commissioners and I will say
 
01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.299 align:start position:0%
when we went around to each County last
 
01:03:33.299 --> 01:03:35.089 align:start position:0%
when we went around to each County last
year

01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
had listening sessions every County the
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee went to at least
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
once and we had held several
 
01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:43.609 align:start position:0%
once and we had held several
um

01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.829 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who showed up
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
were minimal
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
and on top of that the comments
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
that they made were on the U.S House cd1
 
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
that they made were on the U.S House cd1
cd2

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
cd2
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
and then their County redistricting in
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
terms of their state representatives I
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
never heard one question about
 
01:04:11.819 --> 01:04:13.549 align:start position:0%
never heard one question about
commissioners

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
Commissioners districts
 
01:04:19.329 --> 01:04:19.339 align:start position:0%
were for the existing ones were redrawn
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
never received a single comment on a
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner's District
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to redistricting
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
the con the
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
the ease of drafting a commissioner's
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
district is much more simple
 
01:04:35.099 --> 01:04:36.589 align:start position:0%
district is much more simple
than

01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:38.630 align:start position:0%
than
uh

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
State reps as an example Stratford
 
01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
County County we're talking about
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners very easy to to
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
develop count districts there think
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
about trying to fit 38 Representatives
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
into that same same area much more
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
difficult so this is not
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is not a
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
something that is extremely extremely
 
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.530 align:start position:0%
something that is extremely extremely
difficult

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.490 align:start position:0%
difficult
um

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
trying to think of some of the other
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions or comments that were made did
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
I end I can't remember if I answered
 
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative cahills yet
 
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
representative cahills yet
um

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
I think that's all I have somebody
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned the cost there will be no
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
costs I spoke with OLS somebody last
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
time talked about
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
saying we need to have a new election
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
for commissioners
 
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
what it's saying is the next time the
 
01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
election cycle comes around we will be
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
electing Commissioners to districts
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
within Stratford County so there will
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
not be any additional
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
costs involved with that
 
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
and that's it for now
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
represents Davis
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I hear that you're
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
clearly passionate about your bill
 
01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I wish that we could vote on the
 
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.450 align:start position:0%
and I wish that we could vote on the
bill

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions we're going
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
to have the clerk call the roll
 
01:06:12.119 --> 01:06:15.410 align:start position:0%
to have the clerk call the roll
yes

01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I appreciate it
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I I want to reiterate
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
the message that I got from the people
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
who talked to me and emailed me and left
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
me messages about transparency and about
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that the input for changing
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
something that's worked in Stratford
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
County for decades
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
um they weren't they weren't asked about
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
it not broadly enough not widely enough
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
and I understand that people don't often
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
come to
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
listening sessions when they don't think
 
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
there's a big problem but when something
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be changed then they see
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
that there may be a problem and they
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
they speak up about it and I really want
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
to be listening
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
to those people uh who who are speaking
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.049 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:15.059 --> 01:07:15.829 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative priest I would like
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
to Echo the comments that were expressed
 
01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:24.299 align:start position:0%
by the previous representative
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
I think there is no transparency in this
 
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:31.700 align:start position:0%
and to really further and to make this a
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
districting plan that we that the
 
01:07:38.049 --> 01:07:38.059 align:start position:0%
chairman wants we should
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
retain this or put it into a study
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
committee and reach out to all of the
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
communities and the residents and get
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
their input on this matter thank you
 
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay on that comment I've I've heard
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
this uh several times now this bill has
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
been out for two months
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
people have more than enough time to
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
come and testify we received an email
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
everybody received a an email from a
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
gentleman involved with a
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
advocacy group I'll call it that
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
talking about a lot of the issues that
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
y'all are bringing up the same
 
01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:17.930 align:start position:0%
y'all are bringing up the same
individual

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
individual
who

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
casually suggests
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom of his page that you
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
redistricting plans are under challenge
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
in court would he failed to mention in
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
that email was that he and his group a
 
01:08:38.289 --> 01:08:38.299 align:start position:0%
very partisan although he calls it
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
is the one who has filed those lawsuits
 
01:08:45.239 --> 01:08:48.169 align:start position:0%
is the one who has filed those lawsuits
also

01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
there were many things that he put in
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
here were just totally wrong talking
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
about the unconstitutionality of it much
 
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
like the commissioner mclaris did it's
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
fine when people send out information
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
but when they send out information
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's totally wrong I mean that's
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
that's another
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
another thing we we keep hearing how
 
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
this has worked in our County it has not
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
obviously the people who knew about it
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
and took the time that came out come out
 
01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:17.060 align:start position:0%
and spoke about it they were adamantly
 
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
speaking adamantly for the bill and
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
letting it be known that they did not
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
feel this has been working for Stratford
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
County for a very long time uh
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can we vote on this bill
 
01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.329 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can we vote on this bill
please

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
yes representative only to just very
 
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
briefly paraphrase and repeat what I
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
said before that this is a committee
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that deals with the the nuts and the
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
bolts of how counties and municipalities
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
work this bill presents us with an
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
excellent opportunity to as I said do a
 
01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
deep dive into this issue which is
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
clearly a divisive issue and I think
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
that as a committee our charge is to
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
deal with these issues and we ought to
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
deal with them as presented in this bill
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative majority
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
um I was prepared to vote in favor of
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
this bill when we first heard it for
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
reasons that I've heard I I've ever
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
since I've been on this committee I've
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
talked about consistency in our
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
community in our in well in all of our
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
communities and certainly our counties
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
um but I've heard things here today that
 
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.770 align:start position:0%
um but I've heard things here today that
that

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure the transparency is the
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
word that I want to use so much as I
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
like the word Deep dive this may be the
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
right thing to do and this may be the
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
right way to do it I'm convinced that
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's perfectly legal to do it
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
having done the research on the
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
difference between creating the
 
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
districts and redistricting
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
um but I I fully support the idea of
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
retaining it to make sure that it has
 
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
been fully vetted and has had as much
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
input as possible thank you thank you
 
01:12:58.739 --> 01:13:00.290 align:start position:0%

01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
chair just for process when we retain a
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%

01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
the end of our the next term or do we
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
have a deadline for when we have to take
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
action there is a deadline I believe it
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
will be in the fall and then we
 
01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
will be in the fall and then we
um

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
the the bill will go with a
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the floor at the
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%

I originally was going to vote no to

retain because I don't think it's a very
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
still it's not a very good bill
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and working on it I just want to be
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we are all mindful of the fact
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a whole bunch of people we
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%

01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill and would like to
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
have a chance to discuss it
 
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
so for that reason
 
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I will be opposing the motion of itl
 
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:15.020 align:start position:0%
just so that
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
have a chance to discuss my Amendment
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Guthrie
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my comment was
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
that uh as any uh
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
abatement if you will uh our credit uh
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
that goes to a particular group in a
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
community uh there always is the issue
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
and the concern that the uh you know
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
John paying for Miri uh and I I know
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's a considered we can can't get
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
away from and I was surprised I happened
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
to take this uh Bill to my uh Tom clerk
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
who I have a great deal of respect
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
perspective for and she was I told her I
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
was going to get it for her and she was
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
all upset because of that those concerns
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
and once she read the bill I think she
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
thought it had a lot of Merit and
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
because it was enabling she was not
 
01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:24.980 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with it I think my and I
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
personally think that this bill is ahead
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
of its time I think it's something
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to go come
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh to the communities for their
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
consideration sometime in in the future
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
but uh I I don't see it uh being
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
accepted by uh any communities uh if it
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
was brought forward to them but having
 
01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:52.460 align:start position:0%
said that I think
 
01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:54.620 align:start position:0%
it's something that's going to happen
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to get to the position where
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
we now have uh part-time kindergarten uh
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
and it's just uh children are going to
 
01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:08.780 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten based on the lottery
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh and you know that seems to be kind of
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
unfair and what do we do those people
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
who didn't win the lottery
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh maybe uh they need some consideration
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
so I think it's I need some discussion I
 
01:19:25.729 --> 01:19:25.739 align:start position:0%
think it's uh probably something that's
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to happen uh after my time
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
but I I appreciate the uh the bill when
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to even though it's
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
enabling I'm going to have to vote
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
against it I think it's just as
 
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
something that's not going to be
 
01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.270 align:start position:0%
something that's not going to be
accepted

01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
service

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
I am in sympathy with the intent of this
 
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
I am in sympathy with the intent of this
bill

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
I have numerous issues with the
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of it there is no
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
means testing in this bill as there are
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
for other tax exemptions and credits
 
01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:10.460 align:start position:0%
that we Grant to other populations
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
there is also a section in the bill that
 
01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
deals with landlords and and but it is
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
not clear at all how the landlords are
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
to pass on the child tax credits to
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
their tenants there's no mechanism by
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
which that can be measured so
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
theoretically a landlord could rent to
 
01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
tenants with kids and reap the rewards
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
of the child tax credit without passing
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
that along to the tenants
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
which seems uh absurd on its face to me
 
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.470 align:start position:0%
which seems uh absurd on its face to me
um

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
and there was another issue with it I
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
was I see even though it is enabling
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
the means testing is where I just stop
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
in my tracks because if Elon Musk moved
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
to Lebanon and this was enacted and we
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
enabled it through our city council Elon
 
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
musk's would get a tax credit if he had
 
01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
more kids and that's just unacceptable
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
for the comments representative majority
 
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm heaping on but I would
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
also note that the bill has technical
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
flaws that haven't been addressed even
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
even if the amendment was introduced
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's another technical flaw you can't
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
have a percentage in the bill it has to
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
be a fixed dollar amount dra can operate
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
with with the idea of any percentage
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
they they need they need guard rails so
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh the the bill may be well intended and
 
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
ahead of its time but it is not ready
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%

again
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
um we have a housing crisis in this
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
state and I feel like this is one of the
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
tools that is needed in those
 
01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
communities with water and sewer I think
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
the zoning and the contextual
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
concerns will all be addressed with the
 
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.810 align:start position:0%
concerns will all be addressed with the
local

01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:37.820 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
zoning controls and if they aren't they
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and I feel like this is an important
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
tool and I think this amendment would
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
just a limited to those areas with water
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
and sewer thank you
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%

point out in the amendment there appears
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
to be an error
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the last line such accessory units
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
shall only be permitted on Lots served
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
by Municipal City and Sewer
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
um as I'm just looking at this this
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
amendment it looks like it is
 
01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:31.790 align:start position:0%
amendment it looks like it is
[Music]

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.189 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
amending the
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
section of law which previously granted
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
um accessory dwelling units as a matter
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
of right and now is saying that such
 
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units shall only be
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
and then the error
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is actually a step
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
back because I think it
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
um it would not it would restrict what
 
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
is currently a right of all
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
properties in the state to just the
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling
 
01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:15.890 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling
um

01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
that is already allowed to be changed to
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
just allowed on um Lots served by
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
Municipal City
 
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and so
 
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
um while I think this this uh
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
needs I think what what this really
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
needs is this bill needs to be retained
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
or um or tabled in some some aspects so
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
that this committee and or the committee
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
on housing can really do the work
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
um uh address the needs of the housing
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the state and
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
um while I I believe this this amendment
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
is well intentioned I think that
 
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
um it just it it's it signals that there
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
is a knee is the willingness to work on
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
um and so for that reason I think that
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
we should um
 
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
 
01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.350 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
Gallagher

01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I would like to
 
01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:32.420 align:start position:0%
um Echo representative
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
yokella's concern about this possibly
 
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
being a step backwards
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
um instead of shall only be permitted
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
the better wording might be so only be
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
required to be permitted
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's something that we would that
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
that would that could be an alternative
 
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.450 align:start position:0%
that would that could be an alternative
Amendment

01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.010 align:start position:0%
Amendment
that

01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
um we would discuss after retaining
 
01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
um we would discuss after retaining
um

01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:03.169 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:29:03.169 --> 01:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um I
 
01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.290 align:start position:0%
yeah um I
I think

01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment I think the bill
 
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.209 align:start position:0%
this amendment I think the bill
um

01:29:11.209 --> 01:29:11.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't think that this
 
01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
particular amendment is the right way
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
forward for this bill but I would like
 
01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
to see the underlying bill
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
um succeed and hope that we can have a
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
chance to help it do that
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
I wholeheartedly support representative
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
yokelo's comments
 
01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comments
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
support I mean I'm talking about the
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
procedural thing this happened to me a
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
couple of terms ago when there was a
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
error on the amendment and uh the
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
committee at that time recessed and I
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
got a change and corrected and brought
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
it back after lunch which I'm looking at
 
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
the clock it's getting to be close to
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
that is there a way instead of retaining
 
01:30:06.010 --> 01:30:06.020 align:start position:0%
it for a whole
 
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
year and bring it back with the right uh
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
Amendment because this is a critical
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
piece that we need to address the
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
housing shortage any number of ways that
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
we can do to help alleviate this is not
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
the only answer this is one of many
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
tools and we are desperate with housing
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
need and instead of retaining it for the
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
whole year if there's a way that we
 
01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is a question
 
01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
to the chair what is the procedure when
 
01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:49.990 align:start position:0%
to the chair what is the procedure when
we

01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
receive an amendment and there's errors
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
that we find in the discussion of it
 
01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.669 align:start position:0%
that we find in the discussion of it
um

01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned on this we will
 
01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:04.139 align:start position:0%
proceed with a vote on what exists it's
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
up to the individual who's bringing the
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
amendment forward to make sure that that
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
bill is properly vetted and correct
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
which brings us to the point of a lot of
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
times we get these amendments very very
 
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
last minute not a big fan myself from
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
either side because it does it's really
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us proper time
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know to vet the actual Amendment but
 
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh so we'll as far as I'm concerned
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to vote on the amendment
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
letting me make my comments I happen to
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
come from a community as that has
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
neither Municipal Water or soup
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh so you know all these things that are
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
being tried for the housing is sort of
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
on the side because it almost in every
 
01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.229 align:start position:0%
on the side because it almost in every
case

01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a given that if you don't
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
have sewer and water
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
then it's a local matter and you better
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
keep that local control there because if
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
you require towns that have that don't
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
have serum water to do things that might
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
impact adversely on their sewer and
 
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.290 align:start position:0%
impact adversely on their sewer and
water

01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:20.300 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much given that that we
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that and that plus the
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'll be in favor of the
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendment but I can't vote for the bill
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a funny situation but I
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
I will vote for the uh the the article
 
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
because I think that's the direction all
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
these bills should go to go through but
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
I can't vote for the article uh in uh a
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
matter of a right instead of uh option
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a question
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
for representative priests you can
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
choose to answer this or not I'm just
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how this amendment
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
uh was going to how you felt this
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
amendment itself was going to fix the
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
the problem with the the bill maybe you
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
could just clarify a little bit please
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative priest you may answer
 
01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
that if you'd like yes I will thank you
 
01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman there was concerns when this
 
01:33:25.209 --> 01:33:25.219 align:start position:0%
was discussed last week about
 
01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
imposing additional housing units in
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
areas where and on on lot sizes that
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
were not sufficiently you know adequate
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
with water with their own Wells and
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
septic tanks so that's what I thought it
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate just to limit
 
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
the adus in areas where there was Public
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer
 
01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
but representative Tatro
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
um coming from a community that
 
01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
does not have
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
water and Municipal City
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
water or sewer
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
um this would take the communities I
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
represent right out of the
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
the housing auxiliary unit
 
01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.450 align:start position:0%
the housing auxiliary unit
Market

01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:24.229 align:start position:0%
Market
um

01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:24.239 --> 01:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
with all the talk of
 
01:34:30.649 --> 01:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
not having enough housing seems to me
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
this is negative against
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
making more housing
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
and also discriminatory because the
 
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
eliminating towns that don't have
 
01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:43.610 align:start position:0%
eliminating towns that don't have
um

01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
accessory municipal
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
sewer and water
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
and the property owners may have enough
 
01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.129 align:start position:0%
and the property owners may have enough
land

01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
to comply with state law and that's
 
01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.610 align:start position:0%
to comply with state law and that's
already

01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
square footage
 
01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.310 align:start position:0%
square footage
of

01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:09.980 align:start position:0%
septic systems Plus
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
location of the Well Service so I I
 
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
cannot support this
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I seek the wisdom of
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:33.980 align:start position:0%
should I retract that
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
now and honestly I do and and I want to
 
01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:39.470 align:start position:0%
now and honestly I do and and I want to
respond

01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
in my comments to something of
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative yakella said the Speaker
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the House in his wisdom has created a
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
special housing committee
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
clearly this is a bill that needs to be
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
examined by this special housing
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee what is the proper procedure
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
from our perspective as a committee
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
to get it from our committee to the
 
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
special housing committee that is an
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
excellent question which I do not have
 
01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%

01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%

01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%

01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%

um so we can get lunch and then
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
um come back don't believe that's a
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
motion oh that could be for me we're
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking for a motion on the bill we've
 
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
opened up the hearing on HB 423 uh
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald do you have a
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
motion yes no representative McDonald
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
moves itl on HB 423 do we have a second
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
a second representative Cahill seconds
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:45.179 align:start position:0%
we have very limited uh water and sewer
 
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
treatment and this would probably cost
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
my community to replace that plant
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
probably 50 to 100 million dollars to
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
build a bigger plant to treat these new
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
houses now we've got a master plan that
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
spells out how many properties we can
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
develop on I think this is just about my
 
01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.030 align:start position:0%
develop on I think this is just about my
community

01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comments uh
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative uh yeah representative
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hicks thank you Mr chairman
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that I'm conflicted on
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
um I want to support this bill I I have
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
problems with this
 
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.629 align:start position:0%
problems with this
um

01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
I feel this is opening the gates to even
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
more adus in the future
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know what people will do with
 
01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
with those adus
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
I know in my neighborhood there's great
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
including a constituent in my own
 
01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.490 align:start position:0%
including a constituent in my own
household

01:39:42.490 --> 01:39:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
I disagree with that constituent
 
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
because we need more housing desperately
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
but that said constituent also said fine
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
then we will rent it out and help pay
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
our mortgage
 
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and that is not in the spirit of this
 
01:39:59.810 --> 01:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
I don't believe and she meant short-term
 
01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:00.729 align:start position:0%
I don't believe and she meant short-term
rental

01:40:00.729 --> 01:40:00.739 align:start position:0%
rental
 
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
so as much as I want to support this I
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the right form of
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank representative representative
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
color thank you for recognizing me
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
um disagree with representative McDonald
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any um Amendment having
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
to do with Municipal Water and Sewer so
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
I believe those comments were
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
um relevant to the bill at hand and I
 
01:40:29.639 --> 01:40:31.189 align:start position:0%
um relevant to the bill at hand and I
also

01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:32.510 align:start position:0%
also
um

01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know I believe that that one of
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
the uh that there is a lot of I believe
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
that there is a lot of
 
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.910 align:start position:0%
that there is a lot of
um

01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh support for working on this by the by
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that the chair of the housing
 
01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:52.139 align:start position:0%
committee is in attendance right now and
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
the um and the sponsor of the bill is is
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
um you know in attendance uh rushing to
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
go get amendments
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
um even as far as today
 
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
um and so I just believe that um in
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
answer to representative stavis's
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
comment about how do we get this from
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
our committee to the housing committee
 
01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:16.139 align:start position:0%
it would be a motion to vacate
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
from this committee on the floor and of
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
the house and then to recommit to the
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
housing and the housing board or the
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
housing committee is
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
um you know going to I believe meet
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
regularly and and going to be doing deep
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
Dives in this type of issue and so I
 
01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
agree with the with the representative
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
that this is the proper place and
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
um will give the work have the time to
 
01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
do the work the Deep dive work that
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
needs to be done on this and so while of
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
course I would be in favor of retaining
 
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
in this committee I would also be in
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
favor of vacating to the housing
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
committee also which I don't believe can
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
be made in this at this time but could
 
01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
be made on the house floor
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
um next week when we meet again
 
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Gallagher
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so just as representative
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
yokello was noting with um some of our
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
audience members in attended to say I
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
was wondering if we could have
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
um Prime sponsor read recognized to help
 
01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:30.659 align:start position:0%
us clear up some of the questions that
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
we had about this bill
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
let's add a question of the chair yes
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
that's a question after the chair uh no
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
we are going to continue with this bill
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative man japoodi thank you Mr
 
01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:44.629 align:start position:0%
representative man japoodi thank you Mr
chair

01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
01:42:46.139 --> 01:42:47.649 align:start position:0%
um I would
suggest

01:42:47.649 --> 01:42:47.659 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
this is my feeling on this Bill yes I am
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this and if instead of
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
itla if you're not willing to do it
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
right here in the committee send it to
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
as ought to pass and bring a floor
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then vacate it to wherever
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
it needs to go if we are not willing to
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
do that right here in our committee at
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
least give this chance because this is a
 
01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:18.659 align:start position:0%
very important tool that we need to
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
increase the housing and if that is
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
agreeable there's enough support if we
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
can instead of belaboring here and
 
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
retaining it move it forward I think
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that the housing
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee has eyes and ears and it's not
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily to vacate we just take
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
action on this this uh whether we want
 
01:43:47.649 --> 01:43:47.659 align:start position:0%
to retain it or uh
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
i.tell it and they I'm quite sure that
 
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
as I said they have eyes and ears I
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary to vacate
 
01:43:59.470 --> 01:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think this is not a
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
very important conversation I appreciate
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the chair giving us time to have this
 
01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.850 align:start position:0%
the chair giving us time to have this
conversation

01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I frankly don't know whether this is
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
a good bill or not there are good parts
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
to it there are not so good parts to it
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that worries me
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
about the special committee on housing
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%
is how will it dovetail with the work
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
that we do on a daily basis in Municipal
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
and County Government
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
how will the laws that undergird
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
the way our counties and municipalities
 
01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:48.790 align:start position:0%
the way our counties and municipalities
run

01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
run
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
be assured that they are not trampled
 
01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.450 align:start position:0%
be assured that they are not trampled
upon

01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
in a rush to develop more housing when
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
maybe those areas in which that housing
 
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
is thought to be developed are not
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that area but may be
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for another area so
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's a concern I have and I also would
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%
like to offer another suggestion
 
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we take a vote on the bill that we
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
debated on the floor or table it in
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
which case it can be pulled off the
 
01:45:21.119 --> 01:45:22.010 align:start position:0%
which case it can be pulled off the
table

01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
and reconsidered by either our committee
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
or another committee but I think that it
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
it appears obvious to me that we are not
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
equipped or prepared to dispose of this
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
bill today
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman just a clarification I
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
believe representative McDonald made a
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
motion I don't I didn't hear a second so
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned that we have a motion
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
on the floor yes
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
what's up okay there is a motion of ital
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
so I guess I just asked if we could uh
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm so conflicted on on how to
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
get this to the right people because I
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
still have questions I I asked the
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
question in committee when when
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
testimony was given that that this this
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
is only a step towards and I forget the
 
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
exact words uh that that the that the
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
witness used and I asked well can you
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
tell me how how many units we have added
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
or how much the one Adu mandate has it
 
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
has helped the situation and the answer
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
is we don't have those stats so I asked
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
well then how does doubling this to two
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
help if we don't have any stats I'm more
 
01:46:40.129 --> 01:46:40.139 align:start position:0%
than happy to support something that
 
01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:42.179 align:start position:0%
helps housing but I have to be able to
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
report back to my community and say
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
which by the way has told me not to
 
01:46:48.890 --> 01:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
support this but say this will help in
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
this way so I just however we can get it
 
01:46:54.649 --> 01:46:54.659 align:start position:0%
to the right people I'm all for that
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:46:58.679 --> 01:47:00.169 align:start position:0%
representative uh
X

01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
X
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just want to be
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
clear that um if
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
I support the Ito motion it does not
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
mean that I want to kill this bill
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
entirely and so that's a difficult thing
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
for me I do think that this should be
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
continue to be studied
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I support the itl
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I I really support expanding our
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
housing and I think accessory dwelling
 
01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
units can be a tool to that but the way
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is now
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
in my day job on the resources committee
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've been
 
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about are failed Wells
 
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
that Wells are being overused in a
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
drought situation we have catastrophic
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
well failures throughout the state and
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have a couple bills in front of our
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee now on that so I think any
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill that this committee is considering
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
to add housing onto an existing lot I
 
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
think it would be appreciated and
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
helpful to have a a component of that

direction on that from
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%

01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
I am part of the minority of the vote so
 
01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.450 align:start position:0%
I am part of the minority of the vote so
yeah

01:50:37.450 --> 01:50:37.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%

senior members of the minority committee
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
not the vote

not the vote
so

01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
the mind the senior member of the
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee voted to
 
01:50:58.490 --> 01:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
to itl they weren't part of the the
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee on this vote
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
correct but she will get the final
 
01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
decision on who writes the committee
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
report okay
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
if if that's you that's fine but
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative I don't I I just that's
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
fine I understand your position
 
01:51:22.689 --> 01:51:22.699 align:start position:0%
and that closes the exact session
 
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
exact session on 423
 
01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:27.530 align:start position:0%
exact session on 423
[Music]

01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
it looks like we have
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
one two three four five we've got about
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
six more representative priests
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
yes could this be taken off of the
 
01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.870 align:start position:0%
yes could this be taken off of the
consenta

01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
consenta
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not on the consent
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
I I assumed it wouldn't go on the
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
um we have six more to go I don't think
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
we can do those in 10 minutes so why
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't we break until 1 30 that gives
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
everybody an hour and we'll come back
 
01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.760 --> 03:03:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
everything

03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:49.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:03:49.849 --> 03:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:52.610 --> 03:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay folks we're gonna get going here
 
03:03:55.130 --> 03:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
um we'll go open up the exact session on
 
03:04:03.550 --> 03:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative priest I like a motion
 
03:04:10.130 --> 03:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
that we uh OTP
 
03:04:11.809 --> 03:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
um bill
 
03:04:15.650 --> 03:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
HB 467.
 
03:04:18.410 --> 03:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
do we have a second representative
 
03:04:20.510 --> 03:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to emotion yes I
 
03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:21.530 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to emotion yes I
would

03:04:21.530 --> 03:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:04:24.769 --> 03:04:24.779 align:start position:0%
um the reason why I think access
 
03:04:28.690 --> 03:04:28.700 align:start position:0%
to any park is essential well designed
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're all well constructed and I think
 
03:04:34.130 --> 03:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
it's essential if you have any
 
03:04:37.550 --> 03:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities physical disabilities
 
03:04:40.370 --> 03:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and and are handicapped and I have a
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
personal experience I would like to
 
03:04:44.330 --> 03:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
share with you because I have a nephew
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
who has physical disabilities and I see
 
03:04:47.399 --> 03:04:49.190 align:start position:0%
who has physical disabilities and I see
him

03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
him
 
03:04:51.010 --> 03:04:51.020 align:start position:0%
um on
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
Pathways that are not accessible and
 
03:04:58.690 --> 03:04:58.700 align:start position:0%
they don't mean the F the ADA
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
requirements and it's just heartbreaking
 
03:05:05.330 --> 03:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill kind of rectifies
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
03:05:08.690 --> 03:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:10.010 --> 03:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
do we have any other comments
 
03:05:12.410 --> 03:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
03:05:15.410 --> 03:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I do
 
03:05:19.309 --> 03:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
um believe that it it is important to
 
03:05:22.969 --> 03:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
have public playground accessibility
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
um for all people
 
03:05:28.130 --> 03:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
however due to the fact that there are
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
already Federal requirements
 
03:05:34.610 --> 03:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
to have surfaces that allow for
 
03:05:37.370 --> 03:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
accessibility to these playgrounds I
 
03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
don't see the need for this bill
 
03:05:44.809 --> 03:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'd be voting against OTP
 
03:05:46.849 --> 03:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:05:48.830 --> 03:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:05:51.410 --> 03:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
um we did hear in testimony when we when
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
you heard this bill
 
03:05:56.530 --> 03:05:56.540 align:start position:0%
um that the while the Ada is terrific
 
03:05:59.570 --> 03:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
and requires many things it does not
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
take into account variations in climate
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
and what we heard from those who
 
03:06:07.010 --> 03:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
testified and supported this bill is
 
03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
that the harsh New England Winters wreak
 
03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
havoc on the kind of filler that is used
 
03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
to make playgrounds elsewhere in the
 
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
United States accessible rendering them
 
03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
unaccessible for people with physical
 
03:06:22.790 --> 03:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
handicaps in New Hampshire so I will be
 
03:06:24.650 --> 03:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
supporting the ought to pass motion
 
03:06:26.570 --> 03:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
03:06:28.849 --> 03:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I wasn't here
 
03:06:30.830 --> 03:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
but I did look at some of the test mode
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
in regard to some like question that I
 
03:06:36.110 --> 03:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
have is how is this uh funded uh Beyond
 
03:06:38.690 --> 03:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
what's already required by the Ada
 
03:06:42.050 --> 03:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
this is actually not a place I don't we
 
03:06:46.490 --> 03:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative manage putty thank you Mr
 
03:06:48.960 --> 03:06:50.210 align:start position:0%
representative manage putty thank you Mr
chair

03:06:50.210 --> 03:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:06:50.220 --> 03:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
chair
um

03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:55.610 --> 03:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
I am in full support of
 
03:06:58.130 --> 03:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
ought to pass for a couple of reasons a
 
03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
few reasons one is idiot compliance will
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
bring equipment that's adaptive
 
03:07:07.550 --> 03:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
equipment to the playground but it does
 
03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
not address the Ada accessible
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
playground to caregivers who are
 
03:07:17.210 --> 03:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
handicapped so you know it could be
 
03:07:19.969 --> 03:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
adaptive swing adaptive climbing thing
 
03:07:23.630 --> 03:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
for the kids but 88 in a playground is
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
not accessed by the adults so from that
 
03:07:30.170 --> 03:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
angle we need to make sure that the
 
03:07:33.710 --> 03:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
access to playground as a caregiver
 
03:07:38.570 --> 03:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
coming to bring a child to a playground
 
03:07:40.730 --> 03:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
who doesn't need an adaptive equipment
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
so this addresses that in terms of
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
surface if I'm in a wheelchair I can do
 
03:07:45.840 --> 03:07:46.750 align:start position:0%
surface if I'm in a wheelchair I can do
that

03:07:46.750 --> 03:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
and also having been a speech
 
03:07:51.769 --> 03:07:51.779 align:start position:0%
pathologist and worked with the multiple
 
03:07:54.950 --> 03:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
the handicap population disability
 
03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
population for 30 plus years
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
I know exactly what the hurdles are in
 
03:08:05.269 --> 03:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
terms of it and one of the tester monies
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
referred to the playground that's in my
 
03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
district and I'm proud to say a lot of
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
thought was put into it and a lot of
 
03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
public input and taken into we have a
 
03:08:21.349 --> 03:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
playground for special needs kids in a
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
school small one but this is a public
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
playground and so and I cannot tell you
 
03:08:30.650 --> 03:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
how many people show up there in such a
 
03:08:33.650 --> 03:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
joy to watch that to see that it's
 
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
accessible not just for the kids adopted
 
03:08:36.540 --> 03:08:38.690 align:start position:0%
accessible not just for the kids adopted
uh

03:08:38.690 --> 03:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:41.450 --> 03:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh people with disability kids with
 
03:08:44.809 --> 03:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
disability but also the caregivers and
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing something right from
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
the get-go
 
03:08:53.630 --> 03:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
is a lot less expensive than trying to
 
03:08:56.809 --> 03:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
redo redo it and so there's a lot
 
03:08:59.450 --> 03:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
available now so
 
03:09:04.010 --> 03:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
to make inclusive public spaces is a key
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
thing it should be Paramount and this
 
03:09:10.130 --> 03:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
does that and with that I will
 
03:09:15.370 --> 03:09:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:18.170 --> 03:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:20.040 --> 03:09:20.809 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:09:20.809 --> 03:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:25.610 --> 03:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
when I first saw this bill I was
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
adamantly opposed to it because I don't
 
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
like more
 
03:09:31.080 --> 03:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
like more
um

03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:35.570 --> 03:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
restrictions and guidelines and just
 
03:09:38.389 --> 03:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
like seems like trying to make
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
everything more complicated but
 
03:09:44.570 --> 03:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
in the testimony we heard that the
 
03:09:48.070 --> 03:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
municip there was municipality that put
 
03:09:52.490 --> 03:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
a a park on a Warren article and was
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
voted on by the town for X dollars to
 
03:09:59.809 --> 03:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
make some Park and as a taxpayer you get
 
03:10:01.849 --> 03:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
the right to be able to vote that up or
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
down and a lot of that
 
03:10:10.190 --> 03:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
um amount is based on some Engineers or
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
or designers estimate of of what is
 
03:10:19.610 --> 03:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
lawful and and allowed to be put down
 
03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
there and and oftentimes probably going
 
03:10:24.650 --> 03:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
to be a low cost you're trying going to
 
03:10:26.510 --> 03:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
go with the lowest bidder
 
03:10:29.090 --> 03:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
likely and
 
03:10:32.990 --> 03:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
um to save the the taxpayers money but
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
allow the children to have this
 
03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:35.690 align:start position:0%
allow the children to have this
playground

03:10:35.690 --> 03:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
playground
 
03:10:37.490 --> 03:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and these
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
um places are able to bid on some
 
03:10:46.849 --> 03:10:46.859 align:start position:0%
surface which is technically compliant
 
03:10:51.290 --> 03:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
but only compliant if it essentially
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
when it is first installed and then as
 
03:10:55.849 --> 03:10:55.859 align:start position:0%
soon as someone goes on and plays on it
 
03:10:58.969 --> 03:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
is is no longer compliant with the Ada
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
and to
 
03:11:03.050 --> 03:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
bring it in compliance would require
 
03:11:05.690 --> 03:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
essentially full-time staff to go out
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
and make sure this the area is flat and
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
to avoid that they are going back to the
 
03:11:14.510 --> 03:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
voters and saying hey
 
03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
um you you pass this Warren article for
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
X dollars but now we need why more
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
dollars either for the staff to to make
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
it accessible full-time or to redo what
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
what was
 
03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:29.650 align:start position:0%
what was
um

03:11:29.650 --> 03:11:29.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
done to make it accessible all the time
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
without having to hire more staff and
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
and the and the person came and said
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
that it cost
 
03:11:39.889 --> 03:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
um you know a half a million dollars
 
03:11:42.889 --> 03:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
more or any amount of money more when
 
03:11:46.130 --> 03:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer agreed to X price they
 
03:11:49.370 --> 03:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
didn't agree to X Plus y price and I
 
03:11:52.250 --> 03:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
think that that is
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
um like a hidden cost that is going to
 
03:11:57.469 --> 03:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
be forced on to the that taxpayer to
 
03:11:59.690 --> 03:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
make them compliant with the Ada and so
 
03:12:01.550 --> 03:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
um in the effort to try and
 
03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
and ensure that our taxes aren't aren't
 
03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:11.269 align:start position:0%
and ensure that our taxes aren't aren't
uh

03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:13.370 --> 03:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
like we we know what we're getting into
 
03:12:15.050 --> 03:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
when we're voting on the Warren article
 
03:12:18.050 --> 03:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's best that the that the Warren
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
article be uh for a project that will
 
03:12:24.889 --> 03:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
stay compliant and
 
03:12:24.899 --> 03:12:25.610 align:start position:0%
stay compliant and
um

03:12:25.610 --> 03:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think that so for those reasons I
 
03:12:31.969 --> 03:12:31.979 align:start position:0%
think that this even though it's a rare
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
occurrence it's occurrence that that
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
essentially ties the taxpayers to paying
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
more money and so I'm not not in favor
 
03:12:41.330 --> 03:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
of that and so that's why I would be
 
03:12:44.450 --> 03:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of this bill thanks
 
03:12:47.210 --> 03:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
representative true 11.
 
03:12:49.250 --> 03:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm very much in favor of this bill
 
03:12:54.050 --> 03:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
because it was brought home to me during
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
03:12:55.319 --> 03:12:56.929 align:start position:0%
the testimony
that

03:12:56.929 --> 03:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:58.910 --> 03:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
as representative manager Puti said
 
03:13:01.010 --> 03:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
there may be adaptive equipment on the
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
playground but there's no way for a
 
03:13:04.250 --> 03:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
person using
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
a wheelchair or other sorts of AIDS to
 
03:13:10.490 --> 03:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
get to that thing and I've been doing
 
03:13:11.990 --> 03:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
some research
 
03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:12.710 align:start position:0%
some research
um

03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
and my church is in Portsmouth New
 
03:13:17.210 --> 03:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're downtown and we've just
 
03:13:21.290 --> 03:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
installed uh it's a walkway about as
 
03:13:24.290 --> 03:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
wide as a half of one of these tables so
 
03:13:26.450 --> 03:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
about this wide
 
03:13:29.330 --> 03:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
um on each side of the church and it's a
 
03:13:32.929 --> 03:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
mixture of crushed stone and there's a
 
03:13:34.730 --> 03:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
base and I'm waiting for a message back
 
03:13:37.130 --> 03:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
to tell me what the base is it's
 
03:13:40.190 --> 03:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
permeable it doesn't have to get raked
 
03:13:42.410 --> 03:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
every time they use it the stone moves a
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
little bit but not in the way that
 
03:13:46.690 --> 03:13:46.700 align:start position:0%
representative yokelo was talking about
 
03:13:49.010 --> 03:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
we've had it for
 
03:13:52.010 --> 03:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
six months it's pretty much in place so
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think there's things that are doable
 
03:13:56.510 --> 03:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire not way high
 
03:13:58.250 --> 03:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
priced and I know that representative
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
Gilman told me about
 
03:14:02.690 --> 03:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
um mats they have a rubber matting that
 
03:14:04.849 --> 03:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
they can put down and make the
 
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
the walkway accessible they don't have
 
03:14:09.710 --> 03:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
to do the whole playground with that but
 
03:14:12.290 --> 03:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
it makes us a firm surface so I think
 
03:14:13.610 --> 03:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different ways to do it
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
when I find out what the next step is
 
03:14:17.510 --> 03:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'll let you all know and I will be
 
03:14:23.769 --> 03:14:23.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.730 --> 03:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so originally
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
um thinking about this I was in
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
agreement with representative Powers
 
03:14:35.450 --> 03:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
thought and then so I did a little more
 
03:14:38.570 --> 03:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
thinking on that and talking to people
 
03:14:41.210 --> 03:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
because for me
 
03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
doing what's right especially for
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
children is a no-brainer it's my entire
 
03:14:45.899 --> 03:14:47.150 align:start position:0%
children is a no-brainer it's my entire
career

03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
career
 
03:14:50.210 --> 03:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
and in this case why not make it more
 
03:14:53.330 --> 03:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
clear and strengthen that communities do
 
03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
this for kids in the right way so that
 
03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
it's not missed because I respect
 
03:14:59.870 --> 03:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative Kellis said but really
 
03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
for the comments representative Gilman
 
03:15:10.730 --> 03:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:15:14.210 --> 03:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
um I find it interesting that uh two
 
03:15:17.090 --> 03:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
people on the committee are give are
 
03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
presenting their uh arguments and
 
03:15:21.410 --> 03:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
they're kind of against each other where
 
03:15:22.790 --> 03:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
one is saying we don't need this bill
 
03:15:26.170 --> 03:15:26.180 align:start position:0%
because uh the Ada Federal rules already
 
03:15:28.969 --> 03:15:28.979 align:start position:0%
regulate this and the other is saying we
 
03:15:30.349 --> 03:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
don't need this because it'll cost
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
people too much when it's already
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
required by federal law I just wanted to
 
03:15:37.490 --> 03:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
put that out there as an
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
um you know there's two ways to look at
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
this and we have to pick one of them
 
03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:44.460 --> 03:15:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative manager put it thank you
 
03:15:54.170 --> 03:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just to add to it in terms of
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
accessing and uh you know the kids
 
03:15:57.600 --> 03:15:59.870 align:start position:0%
accessing and uh you know the kids
before

03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:16:03.530 --> 03:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
the you know inclusive communities were
 
03:16:06.830 --> 03:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
very limited you would see blind child
 
03:16:09.889 --> 03:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
Crossing or here hard of hearing child
 
03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
on the street kind of thing so to allude
 
03:16:17.690 --> 03:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
to individual or small uh existence but
 
03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
now with the total inclusion and parents
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
population with disabilities living with
 
03:16:31.610 --> 03:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
the families in their own communities
 
03:16:34.269 --> 03:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
that Community has to accommodate
 
03:16:37.309 --> 03:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
inclusion mainstreaming which is a
 
03:16:41.090 --> 03:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing and uh just to enhance
 
03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:42.530 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing and uh just to enhance
that

03:16:42.530 --> 03:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
to give those uh
 
03:16:49.370 --> 03:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
children an opportunity to enjoy every
 
03:16:52.250 --> 03:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
part of their childhood like everybody
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
else so that inclusion will this bill
 
03:16:59.929 --> 03:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
will enhance that inclusive nature of a
 
03:17:03.290 --> 03:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
community and I would urge my colleagues
 
03:17:07.690 --> 03:17:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
um so uh I was just looking back over my
 
03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:17.809 align:start position:0%
um so uh I was just looking back over my
notes

03:17:17.809 --> 03:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
notes
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
um from the hearing and one thing that
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
caught my eye was
 
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
um the municipal associations testimony
 
03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
now normally
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
the municipal association's testimony I
 
03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
can predicted beforehand since they're
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
pretty principled and make
 
03:17:39.050 --> 03:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
recommendations based on those
 
03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
principles but in this case they
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
actually kind of caught me by surprise
 
03:17:46.429 --> 03:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
that they were in support of this since
 
03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be too great of a
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh burden on towns so um yeah I think
 
03:17:58.490 --> 03:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
that is something that is worth noting
 
03:18:00.410 --> 03:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
if this really were going to be a burden
 
03:18:02.690 --> 03:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
they would have said so
 
03:18:02.700 --> 03:18:03.469 align:start position:0%
they would have said so
um

03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:06.230 --> 03:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
and because they they do in fact say
 
03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
that about
 
03:18:12.170 --> 03:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
um many other bills that
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
come before us so
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I think that shows that
 
03:18:24.769 --> 03:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
it this is really going to do more good
 
03:18:28.190 --> 03:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
things than bad things so I think we
 
03:18:31.250 --> 03:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll make a couple
 
03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:41.030 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll make a couple
um

03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:43.250 --> 03:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that uh the vice chair
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
brought up is that the adaos already has
 
03:18:49.870 --> 03:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for this the bill itself
 
03:18:52.730 --> 03:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
talks about rubber matting or other
 
03:18:55.849 --> 03:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
types of service surfaces
 
03:18:58.490 --> 03:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
let's be clear there's nothing that
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
prevents towns from implementing
 
03:19:04.610 --> 03:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
this onto their playgrounds as it is is
 
03:19:06.650 --> 03:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
nothing that prevents that from
 
03:19:09.410 --> 03:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
happening the bill is written uh
 
03:19:11.570 --> 03:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
actually is an unfunded mandate
 
03:19:15.110 --> 03:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony that it costs
 
03:19:17.929 --> 03:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars to put
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
in and then it was hundreds of thousands
 
03:19:20.990 --> 03:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
of dollars to
 
03:19:23.929 --> 03:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
go back and fix something that
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
had been done improperly to that
 
03:19:28.790 --> 03:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
specific item I want to talk
 
03:19:30.889 --> 03:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
um some of the testimony during the
 
03:19:30.899 --> 03:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
um some of the testimony during the
hearing

03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
I got the impression that this bill was
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
they were asking for the legislature
 
03:19:40.680 --> 03:19:42.710 align:start position:0%
they were asking for the legislature
to

03:19:42.710 --> 03:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
put in the irsa's
 
03:19:51.650 --> 03:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
from doing harm to themselves almost
 
03:19:57.010 --> 03:19:57.020 align:start position:0%
like they're expecting us to somehow
 
03:19:59.269 --> 03:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
protect the towns from themselves when
 
03:20:00.349 --> 03:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
the towns are going to put in a
 
03:20:03.710 --> 03:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
playground or or this type of matting to
 
03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the access to the playground
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
they ought to be doing their due
 
03:20:07.920 --> 03:20:08.929 align:start position:0%
they ought to be doing their due
diligence

03:20:08.929 --> 03:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
diligence
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
03:20:13.910 --> 03:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
that what's going in is correct and not
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
expecting legislature to say oh
 
03:20:19.490 --> 03:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
protect us from ourselves by putting in
 
03:20:21.790 --> 03:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
a law that requires this and this again
 
03:20:24.050 --> 03:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prevents talents
 
03:20:26.570 --> 03:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
from doing what's what's in here now the
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
Ada already requires it so I will be
 
03:20:33.950 --> 03:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:37.010 --> 03:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative Brown yes uh thank you Mr
 
03:20:40.670 --> 03:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
chairman uh as a retired engineer I used
 
03:20:42.170 --> 03:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
to specify
 
03:20:44.809 --> 03:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
products for facilities buildings
 
03:20:44.819 --> 03:20:46.030 align:start position:0%
products for facilities buildings
outside

03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
outside
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
landscape and all that type of thing I
 
03:20:49.490 --> 03:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
just reviewed the bill again to make
 
03:20:51.230 --> 03:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
sure I had it right before I commented
 
03:20:54.410 --> 03:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
but in this bill it requires either
 
03:20:56.510 --> 03:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
rubber matting or some type of composite
 
03:21:00.730 --> 03:21:00.740 align:start position:0%
matting as opposed to allowing concrete
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
pavers or asphalt for access to these
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
facilities I just feel like I know when
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
I built these facilities before I very
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
often entertained alternatives to what
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
my initial
 
03:21:20.510 --> 03:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
specification was to save time or money
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
and I'm just I just feel that this bill
 
03:21:26.090 --> 03:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
is limited in that it says it requires
 
03:21:28.730 --> 03:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
rubber or composite materials to be used
 
03:21:30.650 --> 03:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
as opposed to allowing Paving or
 
03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.319 --> 03:21:37.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:21:37.870 --> 03:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
said did I say that right
 
03:21:43.730 --> 03:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
sorry where she has a crushed stone with
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
another material underneath it that
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
provides adequate access I'm all for
 
03:21:50.690 --> 03:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
providing adequate access for these
 
03:21:54.050 --> 03:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
playgrounds I have a nephew that has Ms
 
03:21:55.849 --> 03:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
and he has difficulty getting around as
 
03:21:58.969 --> 03:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
well but I think that this bill as it is
 
03:22:02.450 --> 03:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
limits it I'd be amenable to a bill that
 
03:22:05.469 --> 03:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
had alternatives to this or allowed
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
engineered materials to be used to allow
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable access for this so for that
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
reason alone I'm going to vote against
 
03:22:15.469 --> 03:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
the bill as it is thank you
 
03:22:15.479 --> 03:22:17.570 align:start position:0%
the bill as it is thank you
representative

03:22:17.570 --> 03:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:20.809 --> 03:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do note the bill
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
does provide for alternative surfaces in
 
03:22:27.170 --> 03:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
its text saying rubber composite
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
surfacing or a similar resilient solid
 
03:22:31.250 --> 03:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
surface material
 
03:22:35.809 --> 03:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm corrected thank you
 
03:22:38.160 --> 03:22:40.790 align:start position:0%
I'm corrected thank you
representative

03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:42.230 --> 03:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:47.570 --> 03:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to comment on the statement
 
03:22:50.269 --> 03:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
about the unfunded mandate which I think
 
03:22:53.090 --> 03:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
um a stretch at at Shoe horning the
 
03:23:00.889 --> 03:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
unfended Mandate uh into this as all the
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
playgrounds would be optional
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and so no no no state is saying that
 
03:23:11.450 --> 03:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
you have to ha the state is not saying
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
you have to have a playground and the
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
playground needs to be this we're saying
 
03:23:18.590 --> 03:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
if you build a playground
 
03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
do this and we do that with
 
03:23:24.650 --> 03:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
essentially everything like if you have
 
03:23:26.450 --> 03:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
a police department you have to do this
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
we don't mandate that you have a police
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
department in the state it's not because
 
03:23:32.929 --> 03:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
that's not an unfended mandate right we
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't we don't force people to have you
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
know fire departments but if you have a
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
fire department you have to do this like
 
03:23:43.070 --> 03:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
those types of things are not unfunded
 
03:23:48.769 --> 03:23:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.290 --> 03:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um as you most of
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
you will know I
 
03:23:59.570 --> 03:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
worked as an urban planner for 44 years
 
03:24:02.330 --> 03:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I did was Master
 
03:24:02.340 --> 03:24:04.389 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I did was Master
plans

03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
plans
 
03:24:08.690 --> 03:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
and Park and Recreation plans and you
 
03:24:12.650 --> 03:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
know your final goal was to have parks
 
03:24:16.269 --> 03:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
that were successful that Drew people
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
all people
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
and if the access to these parks are not
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
there and people are not complying with
 
03:24:28.969 --> 03:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
the ADA requirements then you have then
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
nobody uses it
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
and especially when you have a group of
 
03:24:33.960 --> 03:24:34.849 align:start position:0%
and especially when you have a group of
people

03:24:34.849 --> 03:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:24:40.370 --> 03:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
in the United States called disable for
 
03:24:40.380 --> 03:24:41.809 align:start position:0%
in the United States called disable for
whatever

03:24:41.809 --> 03:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
and they're not they're prohibited to
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
using these facilities
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
then you're doing you're not we're not
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
doing what we're supposed to be doing
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
and that is looking out for the safety
 
03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
and Welfare of all people in New
 
03:25:02.809 --> 03:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:05.809 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
um

03:25:05.809 --> 03:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:09.410 --> 03:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes I'd just like to address the
 
03:25:09.420 --> 03:25:10.910 align:start position:0%
yes I'd just like to address the
Point

03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
Point
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
um raised about stopping towns from
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
harming themselves
 
03:25:18.590 --> 03:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
03:25:18.600 --> 03:25:19.490 align:start position:0%
um I think
um

03:25:19.490 --> 03:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:21.769 --> 03:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
yes in general
 
03:25:25.610 --> 03:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
that's a decent principle to abide by
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
um towns it sounds awfully film familiar
 
03:25:32.570 --> 03:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
or similar to um John sturt Mills harm
 
03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
principle but I don't think it's an
 
03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
applicable principle here
 
03:25:38.450 --> 03:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
since the
 
03:25:41.389 --> 03:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
kids that are using these playgrounds
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
are not the ones who are voting on
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
whether to have them or not
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
so it I yeah it's since they're
 
03:25:52.190 --> 03:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
two separate groups of people here
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
03:25:57.889 --> 03:25:57.899 align:start position:0%
the whole harm to self relationship
 
03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
really applies here
 
03:26:03.769 --> 03:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
um so yeah that's my response to that
 
03:26:03.779 --> 03:26:05.870 align:start position:0%
um so yeah that's my response to that
point

03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:26:07.550 --> 03:26:07.560 align:start position:0%

already got that represent Kelly
 
03:30:46.250 --> 03:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
continue thank you thank you Mr chair
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
there was some worry that
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
at some point the owner occupied unit
 
03:30:57.290 --> 03:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
may become a rented
 
03:31:01.250 --> 03:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
um unit and there was some
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh concern about that and so this
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is just to clarify that that
 
03:31:09.530 --> 03:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
is not what we are talking about when
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking about this bill so thank
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
03:31:16.210 --> 03:31:16.220 align:start position:0%
uh discussion uh representative majority
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative priest could you turn
 
03:31:19.969 --> 03:31:19.979 align:start position:0%

03:31:21.650 --> 03:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:31:24.110 --> 03:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
um having just seen the the amendment
 
03:31:26.690 --> 03:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
now this may be my question may be easy
 
03:31:28.790 --> 03:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
to answer but I don't know what the
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
answer is
 
03:31:32.090 --> 03:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
um on line nine it says the legislative
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
body May enact a process for the
 
03:31:35.809 --> 03:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the State Building Code
 
03:31:38.929 --> 03:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
can a local legislative body enact an
 
03:31:38.939 --> 03:31:40.969 align:start position:0%
can a local legislative body enact an
enforcement

03:31:40.969 --> 03:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:31:43.630 --> 03:31:43.640 align:start position:0%
of a State Building Code
 
03:31:45.889 --> 03:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
oh that's the existing language okay
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:58.990 --> 03:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:02.929 --> 03:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:32:08.690 --> 03:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
um I just have one question
 
03:32:10.729 --> 03:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
um for representative yukela which you
 
03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
may or may not choose to answer
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
which is what if the owner is renting
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:21.530 --> 03:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly you may answer that
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:28.969 --> 03:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
um for recognizing me um I believe that
 
03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
that would not that that renting
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't be the owner then
 
03:32:35.210 --> 03:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
they would be a rental it would be a
 
03:32:38.210 --> 03:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
rental just no day
 
03:32:40.490 --> 03:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
no different than
 
03:32:40.500 --> 03:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
no different than
um

03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:45.050 --> 03:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
the rental next door I don't I guess I
 
03:32:47.570 --> 03:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
guess I would
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think that it would count as a
 
03:32:51.889 --> 03:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
rental and wouldn't be covered by this
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
exemption anymore so
 
03:32:57.710 --> 03:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
for the quest uh comments representative
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
um taking my comment I'm going to be
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill although I understand
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
some of the rationale behind
 
03:33:11.889 --> 03:33:11.899 align:start position:0%
um representative Barry's
 
03:33:15.889 --> 03:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
wanting to put it forward and process it
 
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
I think a multi-family unit
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
all the units should be as safe as one
 
03:33:24.650 --> 03:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
another and this is about safety it's
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
not about privacy
 
03:33:30.530 --> 03:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I would even go so far as to say if
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
my town enacted a code where they wanted
 
03:33:35.090 --> 03:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
my single family home to be inspected
 
03:33:38.690 --> 03:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
for code issues every three years I'd be
 
03:33:41.570 --> 03:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
fine with that because
 
03:33:44.330 --> 03:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
um you know you can have a fire you can
 
03:33:46.550 --> 03:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
a mishap with a tree falling on your
 
03:33:51.050 --> 03:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
house you can all sorts of things happen
 
03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
that might be preventable the tree could
 
03:33:55.849 --> 03:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
be preventable prevented by taking it
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
down before it gets to that point the
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
fire obviously being sure that your
 
03:34:02.809 --> 03:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
electricity is up to code that your wood
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
stoves are installed properly
 
03:34:05.520 --> 03:34:06.349 align:start position:0%
stoves are installed properly
um

03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:06.359 --> 03:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:15.769 --> 03:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:17.630 --> 03:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
comment representative fix
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I respectfully
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
disagree with my friend representative
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
11 about having inspections of my home
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
um but here the person is a landlord who
 
03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
is choosing to rent out a unit and make
 
03:34:35.939 --> 03:34:37.670 align:start position:0%
is choosing to rent out a unit and make
money

03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:34:40.269 --> 03:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
um on that unit and there are already
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions for inspection I don't
 
03:34:44.690 --> 03:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
understand and from the testimony it
 
03:34:46.610 --> 03:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
seem to be
 
03:34:46.620 --> 03:34:47.690 align:start position:0%
seem to be
um

03:34:47.690 --> 03:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:49.729 --> 03:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
well let's just say it's a choice to go
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
that route instead of just have a
 
03:34:52.610 --> 03:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
private home so I think there's a
 
03:34:52.620 --> 03:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
private home so I think there's a
difference

03:34:55.190 --> 03:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
03:34:59.389 --> 03:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:35:01.670 --> 03:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
um speaking to the amendment
 
03:35:01.680 --> 03:35:04.010 align:start position:0%
um speaking to the amendment
specifically

03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
um or yeah I noticed that
 
03:35:08.640 --> 03:35:09.530 align:start position:0%
um or yeah I noticed that
um

03:35:09.530 --> 03:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:12.590 --> 03:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
well it it changes more than just the
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
part that was mentioned about
 
03:35:15.720 --> 03:35:16.849 align:start position:0%
part that was mentioned about
um

03:35:16.849 --> 03:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
about uh what the inspection applies to
 
03:35:21.769 --> 03:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
I see it moves it to a completely
 
03:35:25.010 --> 03:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
different part of the rsas
 
03:35:28.090 --> 03:35:28.100 align:start position:0%
um from 155 to
 
03:35:32.809 --> 03:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
674 which I I noticed just because it's
 
03:35:34.250 --> 03:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
like hey wait a second what happened to
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
this other section from the
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
um original legislation
 
03:35:40.319 --> 03:35:41.389 align:start position:0%
um original legislation
um

03:35:41.389 --> 03:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:43.969 --> 03:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
so you're yeah I guess this is a
 
03:35:43.979 --> 03:35:45.650 align:start position:0%
so you're yeah I guess this is a
question

03:35:45.650 --> 03:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
um to representative yokella um if he
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
wishes to answer ask who
 
03:35:55.610 --> 03:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
um why
 
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly you make or may not
 
03:36:07.010 --> 03:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
03:36:08.809 --> 03:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
I can't answer because I didn't
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
understand the question so I'm not in
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:18.170 --> 03:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
represent majority
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
well it's it's the same question why the
 
03:36:23.210 --> 03:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
original Bill wanted to thank you Mr
 
03:36:25.929 --> 03:36:25.939 align:start position:0%
chair the original Bill wanted to amend
 
03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
155-a-7 Roman 3. this new Amendment
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
wants to amend 674.
 
03:36:31.680 --> 03:36:34.570 align:start position:0%
wants to amend 674.
6

03:36:34.570 --> 03:36:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.050 --> 03:36:38.060 align:start position:0%
74 51.
 
03:36:40.849 --> 03:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
Roman I
 
03:36:40.859 --> 03:36:42.410 align:start position:0%
Roman I
so

03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:44.750 --> 03:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm trying I'm trying to catch
 
03:36:46.429 --> 03:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
up and I I remember hearing on the floor
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
the other day if we don't understand
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
then we should vote no and right now I
 
03:36:53.150 --> 03:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
don't know that I understand what the
 
03:36:55.610 --> 03:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
difference is and I so I apologize that
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
I didn't ask a question but I'm with you
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher that I'm just a
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
little confused
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative yakella sure thank you
 
03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:06.710 align:start position:0%
representative yakella sure thank you
um

03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:10.010 --> 03:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying the question
 
03:37:10.020 --> 03:37:10.849 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying the question
um

03:37:10.849 --> 03:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:13.250 --> 03:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that it was moved
 
03:37:16.729 --> 03:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
because the inspectors did not want
 
03:37:19.370 --> 03:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
um it in the section on the um
 
03:37:22.130 --> 03:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
on the building code they wanted it
 
03:37:25.429 --> 03:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's to appease the um
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
some stakeholders the the placement
 
03:37:31.610 --> 03:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:31.620 --> 03:37:33.769 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

03:37:33.769 --> 03:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:35.330 --> 03:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:37:37.250 --> 03:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
um about grammatical comment on the
 
03:37:39.650 --> 03:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
amendment and also a procedural question
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
03:37:45.229 --> 03:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
um if we have a bill before us that
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
amends a given existing statute and we
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
are given an amendment that amends a
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
different statute is that proper
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
and that and my comment on the grammar
 
03:37:58.849 --> 03:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
is in line
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
16 going to line 17 it says relating to
 
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
permitting the unit for renting without
 
03:38:07.969 --> 03:38:07.979 align:start position:0%
the owner's consent
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what that means is it the
 
03:38:13.729 --> 03:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
owner can't consent to renting is it
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the owner doesn't consent it just
 
03:38:19.130 --> 03:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
makes no grammatical sense so I don't
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
understand it and I wonder about the
 
03:38:24.769 --> 03:38:24.779 align:start position:0%
permissibility of us accepting amendment
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
that it amends a different law than the
 
03:38:31.130 --> 03:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard testimony on amends
 
03:38:31.140 --> 03:38:36.170 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard testimony on amends
foreign

03:38:36.170 --> 03:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none will ask the clerk to call a
 
03:38:42.290 --> 03:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.050 --> 03:38:44.060 align:start position:0%
okay HP
 
03:38:46.910 --> 03:38:46.920 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your emotion
 
03:40:34.849 --> 03:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
yes I think we're here to protect the
 
03:40:37.250 --> 03:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
wealth Bill and safety of our residents
 
03:40:39.650 --> 03:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
and when you have a development like
 
03:40:39.660 --> 03:40:40.610 align:start position:0%
and when you have a development like
this

03:40:40.610 --> 03:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
a duplex
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
a Triplex or a quadplex
 
03:40:47.570 --> 03:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
what you do in one unit affects all
 
03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
units and it doesn't matter if your
 
03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
owner occupy or not
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
so I believe the building inspections
 
03:40:59.809 --> 03:40:59.819 align:start position:0%
and regulations should stand forth thank
 
03:40:59.819 --> 03:41:04.250 align:start position:0%

thank you as
 
03:43:24.530 --> 03:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I just want to start by addressing
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we have received from
 
03:43:27.899 --> 03:43:29.150 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we have received from
the

03:43:29.150 --> 03:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:29.160 --> 03:43:30.229 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:32.210 --> 03:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sheriff's Sheriff's
 
03:43:35.929 --> 03:43:35.939 align:start position:0%
Association today opposing this
 
03:43:38.570 --> 03:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
um bill they believe that while they're
 
03:43:42.050 --> 03:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
in favor of more training they
 
03:43:42.060 --> 03:43:43.370 align:start position:0%
in favor of more training they
um

03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:46.269 --> 03:43:46.279 align:start position:0%
uh the training requirement would be in
 
03:43:50.090 --> 03:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
intensive extensive and
 
03:43:52.969 --> 03:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
um essentially would be an unfunded
 
03:43:54.429 --> 03:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
mandate to them
 
03:43:54.439 --> 03:43:56.290 align:start position:0%
mandate to them
to

03:43:56.290 --> 03:43:56.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:43:59.389 --> 03:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
spend money on this when they their
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
budgets are already tight and
 
03:44:05.929 --> 03:44:05.939 align:start position:0%
um that they feel that they that their
 
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
current supportive role to
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities is appropriate I also
 
03:44:12.120 --> 03:44:14.630 align:start position:0%
municipalities is appropriate I also
um

03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.050 --> 03:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
think that uh the sponsor really should
 
03:44:19.729 --> 03:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
have considered
 
03:44:24.530 --> 03:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
um addressing that 91 or the um 20 28a
 
03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
issue by uh assigning this to the state
 
03:44:28.739 --> 03:44:30.710 align:start position:0%
issue by uh assigning this to the state
level

03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:44:32.929 --> 03:44:32.939 align:start position:0%
um and that would have been I think more
 
03:44:36.769 --> 03:44:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh receptive at least or I at least from
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
my perspective I would have been more
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:45.530 --> 03:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that there is such a
 
03:44:48.650 --> 03:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
small amount of these cases
 
03:44:52.610 --> 03:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
um is another reason why the state level
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
operation and training seems to make
 
03:44:58.370 --> 03:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
sense instead of the county level so for
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
all those reasons
 
03:45:01.250 --> 03:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that itale is the proper
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
03:45:05.330 --> 03:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
represents Davis
 
03:45:07.370 --> 03:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
it could be a small amount of these
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
cases because the reporting is so spotty
 
03:45:13.370 --> 03:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
so I will be
 
03:45:15.889 --> 03:45:15.899 align:start position:0%
sorry did you make a motion to Ito
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
I will not be supporting the motion to
 
03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
itl because I believe that um
 
03:45:25.490 --> 03:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
unreported or uncoordinated responses to
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty
 
03:45:30.410 --> 03:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
other than cruelty to horses is not
 
03:45:36.170 --> 03:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.570 --> 03:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative of Elwood
 
03:45:41.450 --> 03:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I don't think this
 
03:45:44.090 --> 03:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
bill really goes far enough in speaking
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
to reporting uh there's no requirements
 
03:45:52.130 --> 03:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
to report say to a repository maintained
 
03:45:54.769 --> 03:45:54.779 align:start position:0%
by the state vet let's say
 
03:45:58.490 --> 03:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
and so it's a feel-good bill to me and
 
03:46:02.330 --> 03:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
unless it's serves a further purpose to
 
03:46:04.490 --> 03:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
coordinate these cases I'm going to be
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
voting Ito
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
03:46:10.739 --> 03:46:11.389 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
um

03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:16.610 --> 03:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
so I'd just like to note that the prime
 
03:46:20.349 --> 03:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor included an amendment
 
03:46:23.570 --> 03:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh when she presented
 
03:46:26.150 --> 03:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
her bill however I think the current
 
03:46:29.210 --> 03:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
motion is on the bill as unamended
 
03:46:31.190 --> 03:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
03:46:32.450 --> 03:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
would like a chance to discuss the
 
03:46:35.399 --> 03:46:36.469 align:start position:0%
would like a chance to discuss the
amendment

03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:46:39.530 --> 03:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
so I will be
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
opposing the motion of itl so that
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
had saw representative Kelly's hand up
 
03:46:50.580 --> 03:46:52.250 align:start position:0%
had saw representative Kelly's hand up
no

03:46:52.250 --> 03:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.889 --> 03:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
hi um thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I would like to agree with
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative stavis that these cases
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
are frequently under reported and in
 
03:47:13.130 --> 03:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that we live in a
 
03:47:16.370 --> 03:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
society that undervalues animals by Epic
 
03:47:16.380 --> 03:47:17.410 align:start position:0%
society that undervalues animals by Epic
Proportions

03:47:17.410 --> 03:47:17.420 align:start position:0%
Proportions
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
I have seen firsthand in my own
 
03:47:24.769 --> 03:47:24.779 align:start position:0%
neighboring Community where cases are
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
purposely dropped because it's more
 
03:47:28.849 --> 03:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
trouble than it's worth to people
 
03:47:31.610 --> 03:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes to to defend animals they
 
03:47:33.050 --> 03:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
think it's too expensive or too much
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
trouble or evidence is stolen I know
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
firsthand of those cases and I
 
03:47:40.729 --> 03:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
personally would prefer to make the
 
03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
effort to have someone who aggressively
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
pursues animal cruelty so
 
03:47:52.330 --> 03:47:52.340 align:start position:0%
um I will be opposing the Ito
 
03:47:55.250 --> 03:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
um I want to support the itl motion I'm
 
03:48:03.410 --> 03:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
an animal lover I I can't even stand to
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
watch those commercials that we see on
 
03:48:07.190 --> 03:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
TV with it I turn them off it just
 
03:48:08.929 --> 03:48:08.939 align:start position:0%
breaks my heart I can cry in an instant
 
03:48:13.250 --> 03:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
however I I I I don't see the the uh I
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
was about to say I don't see the teeth
 
03:48:16.010 --> 03:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
in this bill I guess I did say that and
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
I I shouldn't have said that but I don't
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
see where this where this bill
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
um is going to enhance the current
 
03:48:25.130 --> 03:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
statutes for animal cruelty that exist
 
03:48:25.140 --> 03:48:26.690 align:start position:0%
statutes for animal cruelty that exist
already

03:48:26.690 --> 03:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:48:26.700 --> 03:48:27.349 align:start position:0%
already
um

03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh I I and I guess I'll just leave it at
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
that that I'll support the itl thank you
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
03:48:37.250 --> 03:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:48:39.769 --> 03:48:39.779 align:start position:0%
um sorry if I interrupted you
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
so a number of years ago I took in a
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
stray cat on my doorstep that had been
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
shot about 13 years ago
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
and I reported it
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
and nothing was done about it and I had
 
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
the cat for a long time until he passed
 
03:48:56.929 --> 03:48:56.939 align:start position:0%
away and when he passed away I had to go
 
03:48:59.330 --> 03:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
to a vet and some questions came up and
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
then I had sheriffs asking questions
 
03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
like 13 years later after I had filed
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
out a police report about the cat being
 
03:49:08.450 --> 03:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
shot so while I love animals
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
I don't trust this organization to
 
03:49:12.530 --> 03:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
follow through and do anything about it
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I would agree with Mr yokella
 
03:49:16.610 --> 03:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
possibly on the state agency being in
 
03:49:20.290 --> 03:49:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:23.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:49:23.229 --> 03:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
down the end pretty soon
 
03:49:29.090 --> 03:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I don't think
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is a heavy lift on our County
 
03:49:31.680 --> 03:49:33.010 align:start position:0%
this is a heavy lift on our County
Sheriff's

03:49:33.010 --> 03:49:33.020 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's
 
03:49:37.690 --> 03:49:37.700 align:start position:0%
for something that has been for so long
 
03:49:40.490 --> 03:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
ignored and
 
03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
just Swept Away
 
03:49:43.979 --> 03:49:45.590 align:start position:0%
just Swept Away
and

03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
having grown up and raised horses
 
03:49:54.229 --> 03:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
nothing is you know more cruel than to
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
see horses mistreated
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
and having no Avenue around to report
 
03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:01.729 align:start position:0%
and having no Avenue around to report
this

03:50:01.729 --> 03:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:50:03.469 --> 03:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
um as you know the
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
hi Sheriff from Carroll County submitted
 
03:50:14.290 --> 03:50:14.300 align:start position:0%
a letter of testimony
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
indicating that he didn't feel it was
 
03:50:19.130 --> 03:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
necessary I've had 11 years working with
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the police in the town of moultonborough
 
03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
never had any complaints the police seem
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
to do a good job with that and I haven't
 
03:50:28.190 --> 03:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
heard any complaint from the
 
03:50:30.110 --> 03:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
constituents and the other two towns
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
that I represent so I would vote to it
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
all this thank you representative uh
 
03:50:38.210 --> 03:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
Hicks well thank you Mr chair I'm a
 
03:50:39.650 --> 03:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
little unclear how this is going to
 
03:50:43.010 --> 03:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
increase reporting versus once reporting
 
03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
our report has been made action being
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
taken so I don't quite understand that
 
03:50:53.090 --> 03:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
so and I think that this is a heavier
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
lift then representative priest said
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
especially being completely understaffed
 
03:51:00.010 --> 03:51:00.020 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack County Sheriff's Department
 
03:51:03.530 --> 03:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
this would put quite a burden on that
 
03:51:05.450 --> 03:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
department thank you
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
03:51:07.800 --> 03:51:08.809 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
chairman

03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to follow up and along with
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
what the previous member said in a prior
 
03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
member may have also
 
03:51:22.490 --> 03:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
said this as well but my concern is with
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
the um the increased costs that this
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
03:51:31.130 --> 03:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
represent if it were signed into law we
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
did get testimony from the New Hampshire
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Association
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
um expressing concerns that this um
 
03:51:44.090 --> 03:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
could cost counties quite a bit of of
 
03:51:44.100 --> 03:51:44.929 align:start position:0%
could cost counties quite a bit of of
money

03:51:44.929 --> 03:51:44.939 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:51:46.510 --> 03:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:51:50.929 --> 03:51:50.939 align:start position:0%
it may require additional deputies with
 
03:51:55.490 --> 03:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
um to to receive this training and they
 
03:51:57.769 --> 03:51:57.779 align:start position:0%
also specified
 
03:51:57.779 --> 03:51:58.389 align:start position:0%
also specified
um

03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:01.990 --> 03:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing perhaps another vehicle
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
and they also indicated in their letter
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
of testimony supporting itl that
 
03:52:12.530 --> 03:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
training requirements could include the
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
possibility of the sheriff's deputy
 
03:52:19.130 --> 03:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
having to attend an academy to become a
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
certified law enforcement officer so for
 
03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:22.729 align:start position:0%
certified law enforcement officer so for
those

03:52:22.729 --> 03:52:22.739 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
cons for those reasons I have concern
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
with cost associated with this so I will
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
be supporting itl
 
03:52:34.610 --> 03:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:52:39.650 --> 03:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
from my notes from the public hearing
 
03:52:39.660 --> 03:52:40.610 align:start position:0%
from my notes from the public hearing
um

03:52:40.610 --> 03:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:44.050 --> 03:52:44.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sheriff's Association
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or representative had no
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
position on this and also the training
 
03:52:54.050 --> 03:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
question came up and I don't recall who
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
did that but currently the training in
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
the police academy exists it's just
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
added to the deputy because currently
 
03:53:08.090 --> 03:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
only the deputies can take a complaint
 
03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
or report a complaint or investigate if
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
it is the officer below the deputy
 
03:53:18.349 --> 03:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
cannot do that and considering that
 
03:53:23.330 --> 03:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
animals are voiceless creatures and
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
unless we human advocate for them
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
they can't advocate for themselves
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
and uh so from that
 
03:53:35.809 --> 03:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
but last but not the least
 
03:53:38.929 --> 03:53:38.939 align:start position:0%
our colleague who left us last here who
 
03:53:41.090 --> 03:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
was a strong advocate
 
03:53:43.190 --> 03:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
of animal
 
03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
protection representative Rogers would
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
be smiling down to say we did what is
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
right for the animals so with all that I
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
will be voting against itl and I would
 
03:53:56.279 --> 03:53:57.790 align:start position:0%

representative lasalles
 
03:56:38.330 --> 03:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
an issue right now with
 
03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:44.090 align:start position:0%
an issue right now with
Staffing

03:56:44.090 --> 03:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
03:56:44.100 --> 03:56:46.790 align:start position:0%
Staffing
and

03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:49.370 --> 03:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
um filling all the opening open
 
03:56:51.889 --> 03:56:51.899 align:start position:0%
positions that we have
 
03:56:54.729 --> 03:56:54.739 align:start position:0%
for police
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
you might think well if we do this bill
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
then that would relieve some of the
 
03:57:01.800 --> 03:57:03.110 align:start position:0%
then that would relieve some of the
duties

03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
duties
 
03:57:06.590 --> 03:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the police and free them up but
 
03:57:10.370 --> 03:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
testimony that we got and individual
 
03:57:13.969 --> 03:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
feedback that I got was that this would
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
be seen by
 
03:57:18.170 --> 03:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
police departments
 
03:57:21.650 --> 03:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
as a negative morale booster
 
03:57:25.670 --> 03:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
so with with respect to what's happening
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
right now with police departments I
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
think the timing on this bill
 
03:57:35.210 --> 03:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
is wrong so I will be supporting the
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
retain I'm all for saving money and I
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
think there certainly are
 
03:57:42.479 --> 03:57:43.809 align:start position:0%
think there certainly are
um

03:57:43.809 --> 03:57:43.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:47.450 --> 03:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
situations where we can get away with
 
03:57:51.050 --> 03:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
less than uh a uniformed police officer
 
03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
I just think right now the timing is bad
 
03:57:57.290 --> 03:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
I'll be supporting retaining the bill
 
03:57:59.210 --> 03:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
seeing no further comment we'll ask the
 
03:58:03.769 --> 03:58:03.779 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I didn't see your hand up
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
there representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
03:58:07.309 --> 03:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
chair just quickly
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
um I will support retaining this bill I
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
do hope that in the discussion it isn't
 
03:58:16.729 --> 03:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
a point of emphasis that police officers
 
03:58:20.090 --> 03:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
rely on the duty to make more money I I
 
03:58:21.889 --> 03:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
don't think that should be the point of
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.080 --> 03:58:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:58:26.510 --> 03:58:26.520 align:start position:0%

information upon which any informed
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman I would just like

to comment that as a selectman that the
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
board of adjustment on occasion
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
depending on the town is an elected
 
04:00:40.680 --> 04:00:41.630 align:start position:0%
depending on the town is an elected
official

04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%

04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%

real problem getting rid of an elected
 
04:00:46.620 --> 04:00:47.689 align:start position:0%
real problem getting rid of an elected
official

04:00:47.689 --> 04:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
official
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
because he didn't take a test
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
and I think the uh the intent of the
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
bill is a good one to provide this kind
 
04:00:58.969 --> 04:00:58.979 align:start position:0%
of training I think it is available and
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
All Aboard of adjustment to members
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
should be knowledgeable of what's going
 
04:01:07.450 --> 04:01:07.460 align:start position:0%
on it's a very very important position
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
but I just think it's set up in a way
 
04:01:13.870 --> 04:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
just it's on weirdly if if anything else
 
04:01:22.969 --> 04:01:22.979 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that the uh the
 
04:01:24.889 --> 04:01:24.899 align:start position:0%
information for the board of adjustment
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.410 --> 04:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you Mr chair
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to repeat the remarks that were
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
just said I I believe it would have a
 
04:01:43.250 --> 04:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
dampening effect on zoning board
 
04:01:43.260 --> 04:01:44.630 align:start position:0%
dampening effect on zoning board
membership

04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
membership
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
um also the bill references the
 
04:01:52.250 --> 04:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
the office of the office of business and
 
04:01:58.490 --> 04:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
development and the office of Planning
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
and Development already provide this
 
04:02:03.050 --> 04:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
training so I don't understand why
 
04:02:05.689 --> 04:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
they'd want to move it from one one
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
office to another
 
04:02:09.290 --> 04:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
I think that's it
 
04:02:11.150 --> 04:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to make a quick
 
04:02:14.570 --> 04:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
comment here as a general rule
 
04:02:14.580 --> 04:02:15.349 align:start position:0%
comment here as a general rule
um

04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
we in the committee believe that if a
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
individual sponsor cannot attend his own
 
04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
04:02:27.110 --> 04:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
we will normally
 
04:02:30.170 --> 04:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
send that bill to the dust heaps if we
 
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
need to keep talking about this we can
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
but I think we're all headed in the
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
or the same direction I should say not
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
04:02:40.080 --> 04:02:46.790 align:start position:0%
right direction
foreign

04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%

04:04:22.010 --> 04:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
for some reason it goes through and they
 
04:04:24.349 --> 04:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
say it can't we'll make it we only had
 
04:04:26.330 --> 04:04:26.340 align:start position:0%

second committee
 
04:04:30.889 --> 04:04:30.899 align:start position:0%
and that was the one we did this morning
 
04:04:30.899 --> 04:04:32.090 align:start position:0%

um says that
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
instead of having a warned article being
 
04:05:42.370 --> 04:05:42.380 align:start position:0%
required for
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
these for each lobbying firm that that
 
04:05:49.020 --> 04:05:50.990 align:start position:0%
these for each lobbying firm that that
the

04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:51.000 --> 04:05:53.450 align:start position:0%
the
associations

04:05:53.450 --> 04:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
associations
 
04:05:53.460 --> 04:05:54.910 align:start position:0%
associations
that

04:05:54.910 --> 04:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:57.590 --> 04:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
members are Town School Districts or
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
local public officials those
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
associations shall have membership fees
 
04:06:07.570 --> 04:06:07.580 align:start position:0%
and lobbying fees be separately stated
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
and the lobbying fee be an optional
 
04:06:15.889 --> 04:06:15.899 align:start position:0%
B and not contingent on their membership
 
04:06:18.889 --> 04:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
or the membership not be contingent on
 
04:06:21.650 --> 04:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
on that paying of that lobbying fee so
 
04:06:25.729 --> 04:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
that allows more flexibility at the
 
04:06:28.969 --> 04:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
local municipality that they could
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
either for
 
04:06:34.010 --> 04:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
financial reasons choose to
 
04:06:34.020 --> 04:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
financial reasons choose to
um

04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:38.769 --> 04:06:38.779 align:start position:0%
to Avail themselves of the training of
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
such a membership fee but not uh the
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
lobbying fee that might be accompanying
 
04:06:49.130 --> 04:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
with it or they could do it because of
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
the lobbying would go against some
 
04:06:54.769 --> 04:06:54.779 align:start position:0%
principle that that they do not uh wish
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
to espouse or for whatever reason
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
um the the local municipality will be
 
04:07:04.490 --> 04:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
able to fully
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
discuss the cost the the cost and the
 
04:07:11.090 --> 04:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
benefits of the the lobbying efforts of
 
04:07:13.490 --> 04:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
each of the associations and could take
 
04:07:15.710 --> 04:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
or leave that with
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
um which right now it is
 
04:07:20.929 --> 04:07:20.939 align:start position:0%
um part and parcel of the membership fee
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so it is
 
04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
um part of the cost
 
04:07:27.410 --> 04:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
04:07:30.889 --> 04:07:30.899 align:start position:0%
um also taking taxpayer money and and
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh lobbyists that would espouse
 
04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
um things that the people paying for it
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
would not
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
um be comfortable with uh supporting and
 
04:07:53.570 --> 04:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
so taking taxpayer money and using it
 
04:07:53.580 --> 04:07:54.769 align:start position:0%
so taking taxpayer money and using it
for

04:07:54.769 --> 04:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
for a lot this type of lobbying
 
04:08:01.729 --> 04:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
should only be done essentially with the
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
consent of those people those taxpayers
 
04:08:06.769 --> 04:08:06.779 align:start position:0%
and so this this amendment would allow
 
04:08:09.710 --> 04:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers the right to
 
04:08:09.720 --> 04:08:10.490 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers the right to
um

04:08:10.490 --> 04:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
to make that decision which currently
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
they're not able to do so thank you
 
04:08:16.250 --> 04:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:08:16.260 --> 04:08:17.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
majority

04:08:17.630 --> 04:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
majority
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that the amendment
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire Bill okay so uh at
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
this point to the best of my knowledge
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh communities have the ability to know
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
everything that is being that they are
 
04:08:34.010 --> 04:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
spending their money on and should I
 
04:08:36.889 --> 04:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
know I'll speak only to my town uh we
 
04:08:40.250 --> 04:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
have a line item for uh for all of our
 
04:08:42.170 --> 04:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts for our lobbying
 
04:08:44.330 --> 04:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
organizations contained within our
 
04:08:46.610 --> 04:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
budget our budget additionally the
 
04:08:48.889 --> 04:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
budget committee then can ask questions
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
about where are those fees going or who
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
is getting those fees that information
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
is absolutely readily available and also
 
04:08:58.969 --> 04:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge any
 
04:09:01.370 --> 04:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
represent or excuse me any citizen of
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
the town can can file a petition with 25
 
04:09:08.750 --> 04:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
other 25 24 other people to to restrict
 
04:09:11.090 --> 04:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
those lobbying efforts through any one
 
04:09:13.729 --> 04:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
organization to add any lobbying efforts
 
04:09:16.610 --> 04:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
from an organization so I think what
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to do is already
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
readily available to any Community out
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
there I also don't understand
 
04:09:28.370 --> 04:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
how an organization in this effort is
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to parse their training
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
from their lobbying I see that as being
 
04:09:38.150 --> 04:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm not I I just maybe it's just a not
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
a mature thought yet but I can't
 
04:09:41.809 --> 04:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
understand how an organization that's
 
04:09:44.929 --> 04:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
going to give a training on
 
04:09:48.969 --> 04:09:48.979 align:start position:0%
um on 674 land use
 
04:09:53.090 --> 04:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
would then not be able to lobby for
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
those same efforts to improve the
 
04:09:59.450 --> 04:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
statute so I I don't support the
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
amendment at all and and have other
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts but that's all I have right now
 
04:10:05.530 --> 04:10:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd like to say
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
first of all that I really wanted to
 
04:10:15.290 --> 04:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
vote for this I had it my notes on the
 
04:10:20.090 --> 04:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
front of my uh my paperwork that I
 
04:10:24.769 --> 04:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
ought to pass uh and then after further
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
thinking as a selected and in my town
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's to pretty much transparency too I
 
04:10:33.410 --> 04:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
get concerned about as I said before
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with the word lobbying and
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
what is lobbying I mean is that a bad
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
word I mean is it something like uh it's
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
not a four-letter word it's just I think
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's more than four letters in it so
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's not something we have to clean up
 
04:10:51.050 --> 04:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
off the floor
 
04:10:53.570 --> 04:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest to you that it's
 
04:10:57.110 --> 04:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
lobbying means getting help uh
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
information from a group or a person and
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
you know where that's coming from and I
 
04:11:04.429 --> 04:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
think that's the key you know where it's
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
coming from you can either reject it or
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
accept it but as a public official I
 
04:11:11.330 --> 04:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
need that information
 
04:11:13.969 --> 04:11:13.979 align:start position:0%
uh either it's at a local level at this
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
level as long as I know where it's
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
coming from I have a option to make make
 
04:11:22.130 --> 04:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
it a break it and I think this sometimes
 
04:11:26.210 --> 04:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
this somewhat uh hampers the ability for
 
04:11:29.809 --> 04:11:29.819 align:start position:0%
us to work in concert with people who
 
04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
are trying to help us
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
so I don't think I'm changing my mind
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to change my mind when we
 
04:11:36.000 --> 04:11:36.889 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to change my mind when we
vote

04:11:36.889 --> 04:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
because although I understand the intent
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh particularly of the amendment you
 
04:11:47.809 --> 04:11:47.819 align:start position:0%
know trying to get making make sure that
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're getting the money's going to the
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
right place uh and I condemn I commend
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
that not condemn it I amend commend that
 
04:11:58.849 --> 04:11:58.859 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm not going to be able to
 
04:12:01.490 --> 04:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Jim representative
 
04:12:06.830 --> 04:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I completely agree
 
04:12:08.809 --> 04:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative Guthrie
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
on the points that he made one person's
 
04:12:14.689 --> 04:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
lobbying as another person's expertise
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
in a necessary field and my well one of
 
04:12:21.889 --> 04:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
my concerns with the amendment
 
04:12:26.150 --> 04:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
is that I do feel that it creates an
 
04:12:28.729 --> 04:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate because who in city
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
hall or town hall is going to be
 
04:12:33.530 --> 04:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
responsible for singling out what's
 
04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
education from what's lobbying and
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that those bills are paid
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
are not paid and I and I also have a
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
04:12:44.650 --> 04:12:44.660 align:start position:0%
the author of the amendment statement
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
that people shouldn't be required to pay
 
04:12:51.229 --> 04:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
for views they disagree with
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that should the people
 
04:12:56.269 --> 04:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
in the town change their views that they
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
can then re-adopt the people advising
 
04:13:01.790 --> 04:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
them so it's very confusing to me and it
 
04:13:03.530 --> 04:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
seems to be an infringement on freedom
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
04:13:14.050 --> 04:13:14.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm also confused by
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
the phrase or the local public officials
 
04:13:22.010 --> 04:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
thereof and whether that means that a
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
fellow select board member can cannot
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
come before this commission for say and
 
04:13:33.410 --> 04:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
Lobby for an or against uh bill that
 
04:13:35.630 --> 04:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're discussing
 
04:13:38.210 --> 04:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
um it's a local public official and it
 
04:13:40.969 --> 04:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
could even be uh someone from our town
 
04:13:42.650 --> 04:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
manager Department of Public Works who
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
has a specialty in what we're talking
 
04:13:46.610 --> 04:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
about so if that's what this means I
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:51.060 --> 04:13:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair when I was on
 
04:13:59.210 --> 04:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government last
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
term this bill or something similar came
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
forward and it's it's really unworkable
 
04:14:06.769 --> 04:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
at the local level and I Echo what
 
04:14:10.130 --> 04:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie had said but in
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
my situation
 
04:14:12.889 --> 04:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
um in
 
04:14:15.410 --> 04:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
our Local School board chairman a few
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
years ago was on the board for the New
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association so
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's not as though these associations
 
04:14:22.920 --> 04:14:24.429 align:start position:0%
it's not as though these associations
are

04:14:24.429 --> 04:14:24.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
isolated they're member organizations so
 
04:14:29.929 --> 04:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
people that are on these boards and
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
Boards of selectman school board
 
04:14:34.490 --> 04:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
whatever they're actually part of this
 
04:14:37.130 --> 04:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
Association so I don't really know how
 
04:14:39.110 --> 04:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
you can delineate
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
um discussions of those members who may
 
04:14:45.530 --> 04:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
sit on those boards from what is just
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
informative educational to what is
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
lobbying there is such a big gray area I
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
think it this would create such a undue
 
04:14:56.650 --> 04:14:56.660 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary burden on our local
 
04:14:59.090 --> 04:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities so I'm going to vote for
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
the itl or vote against the ought to
 
04:15:02.279 --> 04:15:04.010 align:start position:0%
the itl or vote against the ought to
pass

04:15:04.010 --> 04:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:15:06.290 --> 04:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
04:15:08.330 --> 04:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the amendment I'll be voting
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:15:13.680 --> 04:15:15.070 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
um

04:15:15.070 --> 04:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:19.070 --> 04:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
I'm currently Citizen selectman and I
 
04:15:22.729 --> 04:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
previously served for three terms as a
 
04:15:24.889 --> 04:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
school board member in my town of
 
04:15:24.899 --> 04:15:27.050 align:start position:0%
school board member in my town of
Litchfield

04:15:27.050 --> 04:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
Litchfield
 
04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
as a school board member there were
 
04:15:34.010 --> 04:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
times when I felt that the school boards
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
Association had an agenda
 
04:15:41.710 --> 04:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
which was an agenda that was completely
 
04:15:46.729 --> 04:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
against what I as a school board member
 
04:15:51.010 --> 04:15:51.020 align:start position:0%
had and it was it was um
 
04:15:54.650 --> 04:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
against what the what the overwhelming
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
majority of the people
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
who had elected me as as a school board
 
04:16:03.889 --> 04:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
member that they were they were pushing
 
04:16:07.870 --> 04:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
something else and they feel that
 
04:16:10.849 --> 04:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
because the school boy there are people
 
04:16:14.170 --> 04:16:14.180 align:start position:0%
who feel that because the School Board
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
Association has a particular feeling
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
about something that has instant
 
04:16:19.979 --> 04:16:21.290 align:start position:0%
about something that has instant
credibility

04:16:21.290 --> 04:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
credibility
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
and I always
 
04:16:28.010 --> 04:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
felt that I that that was a stab in my
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
back now I'm currently a selectman
 
04:16:34.030 --> 04:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's hardly a meeting that goes by
 
04:16:37.450 --> 04:16:37.460 align:start position:0%
when the Selectmen or the Town
 
04:16:40.490 --> 04:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
Administrator doesn't say well we need
 
04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
to talk to the municipal Association
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
and and they perform a valuable service
 
04:16:53.090 --> 04:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
and when a member of the municipal
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
Association comes and speaks to us here
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that they are lobbying even
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
if they were lobbying you know I can
 
04:17:06.769 --> 04:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
tell them to go jump off a cliff
 
04:17:09.050 --> 04:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
you know I'm gonna make up my own mind
 
04:17:14.150 --> 04:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
now their input is valuable
 
04:17:14.160 --> 04:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
now their input is valuable
but

04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:17:19.809 --> 04:17:19.819 align:start position:0%
I don't have to accept that and because
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh they're from the municipal
 
04:17:25.250 --> 04:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
Association that doesn't mean that
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
they're all knowing about something
 
04:17:31.849 --> 04:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
now I do have to say
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
that I I disagree or I'm sorry I agree
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
with my uh my fellow committee members
 
04:17:44.090 --> 04:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
that I don't see how this would work I
 
04:17:47.929 --> 04:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
really don't as much as I dislike
 
04:17:51.889 --> 04:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
paying for uh when I was on the school
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
board as much as I dislike paying for
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
the school board association dues
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
I I just don't see how you can break
 
04:18:05.830 --> 04:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
that out into lobbying or information
 
04:18:08.349 --> 04:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
because as
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
my respected uh
 
04:18:11.479 --> 04:18:13.870 align:start position:0%
my respected uh
compatriot

04:18:13.870 --> 04:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
compatriot
 
04:18:17.570 --> 04:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Davis said one person's
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
lobbying is another person's information
 
04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
so I I just don't feel that it would
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
work and I'm I'm going to be in trouble
 
04:18:28.269 --> 04:18:28.279 align:start position:0%
here because my running mate there
 
04:18:31.010 --> 04:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative Baum this is a dream that
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
he's had for years so
 
04:18:33.479 --> 04:18:34.070 align:start position:0%
he's had for years so
um

04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:37.849 --> 04:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh but I I have to say that I just don't
 
04:18:42.290 --> 04:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.990 --> 04:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so I see this bill as well as
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment and what it's doing is
 
04:18:54.050 --> 04:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's dividing the function right
 
04:18:54.060 --> 04:18:57.550 align:start position:0%
it's it's dividing the function right
now

04:18:57.550 --> 04:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.530 --> 04:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts they
 
04:19:04.210 --> 04:19:04.220 align:start position:0%
pay for a they pay a fee for a service
 
04:19:07.969 --> 04:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
and that service is is a combined
 
04:19:10.610 --> 04:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
service it's it's training it's
 
04:19:13.090 --> 04:19:13.100 align:start position:0%
information it could be
 
04:19:17.570 --> 04:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
legal services if you will opinions and
 
04:19:20.389 --> 04:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
then it's the lobbying piece of it that
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
this funding goes to those purposes with
 
04:19:25.969 --> 04:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
respect to these organizations
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
and to me lobbying is when the the the
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
employees of these organizations come
 
04:19:33.120 --> 04:19:34.729 align:start position:0%
employees of these organizations come
here

04:19:34.729 --> 04:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
to Concord and sit at the witness table
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
and they're wearing orange tags
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
because of their lobbyists they have to
 
04:19:45.650 --> 04:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
register with the secretary of state so
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
I let's be very clear about that and to
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
me what this is is allowing at the local
 
04:19:51.840 --> 04:19:54.410 align:start position:0%
me what this is is allowing at the local
level

04:19:54.410 --> 04:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
and all are caught
 
04:19:59.210 --> 04:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
Services if you will if they if locally
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
a school board or a
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
municipality wants to
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
have these services that they can pay
 
04:20:12.769 --> 04:20:12.779 align:start position:0%
for them or they can do one or either or
 
04:20:12.779 --> 04:20:13.790 align:start position:0%
for them or they can do one or either or
both

04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
and it just separates it out so
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.889 --> 04:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:20:29.450 --> 04:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
04:20:31.969 --> 04:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
so to the points
 
04:20:34.610 --> 04:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
um that Representatives
 
04:20:37.370 --> 04:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
um acellus got three and save us were
 
04:20:39.170 --> 04:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
raising about the
 
04:20:42.170 --> 04:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
um difficulty or
 
04:20:44.110 --> 04:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
um the fine line between
 
04:20:46.490 --> 04:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
distinguishing between providing
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
information versus
 
04:20:51.410 --> 04:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
lobbying where it sometimes hard to tell
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
um I I'd just like to say I do kind of
 
04:20:59.929 --> 04:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
share uh
 
04:20:59.939 --> 04:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
share uh
the

04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
um this bill's sponsors distaste for
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
getting information from lobbyists but
 
04:21:11.330 --> 04:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
the thing is it is useful information
 
04:21:12.830 --> 04:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
though like
 
04:21:15.290 --> 04:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
when the municipal Association provides
 
04:21:16.849 --> 04:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
the information to us oftentimes it
 
04:21:20.150 --> 04:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
helps us clean up the bills and make
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
them better just because
 
04:21:23.279 --> 04:21:23.809 align:start position:0%
them better just because
um

04:21:23.809 --> 04:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know they're good at catching typos
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
and mistakes and stuff like that now
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
if we wanted
 
04:21:33.000 --> 04:21:34.370 align:start position:0%
if we wanted
to

04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:34.380 --> 04:21:36.410 align:start position:0%
to
have

04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:21:36.420 --> 04:21:38.469 align:start position:0%
have
another

04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
way of doing this like perhaps by
 
04:21:44.809 --> 04:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
funding OLS better so that they can hire
 
04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
more drafting attorneys to
 
04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
catch mistakes for us then okay then
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
maybe we wouldn't need the municipal
 
04:21:56.689 --> 04:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
Association as much but this bill
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that though so
 
04:22:02.030 --> 04:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I don't think
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can uh decrease the
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
municipal associations role unless
 
04:22:13.729 --> 04:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
we increase our loss's role instead so
 
04:22:15.650 --> 04:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I can't support this
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the definition of Lobby
 
04:22:26.090 --> 04:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
and it's a group of people seeking to
 
04:22:28.130 --> 04:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
influence politicians or public
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
officials on a particular issue
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say provide training it
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
04:22:36.479 --> 04:22:38.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
information

04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
now I know that as a citizen or a
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I cannot walk into town hall
 
04:22:46.729 --> 04:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
and say give me the password to the
 
04:22:50.510 --> 04:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
portal that gets me into nhma so that I
 
04:22:52.610 --> 04:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
can benefit from everything the
 
04:22:55.729 --> 04:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
municipality is benefiting from
 
04:23:00.969 --> 04:23:00.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:04.729 --> 04:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
dues that is paid is funded by the
 
04:23:07.929 --> 04:23:07.939 align:start position:0%
taxpayers they should have full benefit
 
04:23:13.630 --> 04:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
and have full input into how the town
 
04:23:17.750 --> 04:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
interacts with these associations and by
 
04:23:21.250 --> 04:23:21.260 align:start position:0%
no means do I mean any disrespect
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
to the representatives from nhma here
 
04:23:25.319 --> 04:23:26.530 align:start position:0%
to the representatives from nhma here
today

04:23:26.530 --> 04:23:26.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
I I fully depend on the information I'm
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
able to access but
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
what your what this bill is doing is
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
allowing the taxpayer to decide not the
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
municip not the town government to
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
decide what the political position of
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
the town is
 
04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
and that's how I read what this bill is
 
04:23:56.170 --> 04:23:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
04:24:01.130 --> 04:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think back to the
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
FairPoint litigation and wonder how I
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to as a selectman remember
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
the select board in my town be able to
 
04:24:12.110 --> 04:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
explain to my community the value of
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
getting information from Comcast to and
 
04:24:19.010 --> 04:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
the assessors Association to fully
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
understand what that litigation would
 
04:24:23.450 --> 04:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
imply I don't know how I could explain
 
04:24:27.050 --> 04:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
that to my voters to get Authority when
 
04:24:29.330 --> 04:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
that information is also readily
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
available under statute RSA 15 requires
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
that all fees from lobbying be reported
 
04:24:38.210 --> 04:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
so it is I just we rely on that
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
information it's incredibly valuable and
 
04:24:44.330 --> 04:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
maybe fluid at times in a way that if I
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
had to do it by warrant article and
 
04:24:50.090 --> 04:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
request would be untenable
 
04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and since it's fresh in my
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
mind I'll just address the um recent
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
comment about Warren articles there is
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
no worn article requirement in this bill
 
04:25:07.130 --> 04:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
um so or under in this amendment so that
 
04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
is is not not an issue and also I wanted
 
04:25:14.150 --> 04:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
to address the the comment before about
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
how municipalities can already do this
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
and as a budget Committee Member
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
um who would like to make a motion to
 
04:25:27.290 --> 04:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
not fund the lobbyists
 
04:25:27.300 --> 04:25:27.410 align:start position:0%
not fund the lobbyists
um

04:25:27.410 --> 04:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:27.420 --> 04:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:25:33.229 --> 04:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
but still want to be a member of nhma
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
or or Municipal is or uh the School
 
04:25:39.710 --> 04:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
Board Association or whatever
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I know that I am not able to make
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
that motion and because they there is no
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
option for
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
um for being a member of the municipal
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
Association without the lobbying fee
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
currently and what this amendment seeks
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
to do is to allow me as a budget
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
Committee Member to be able to make that
 
04:26:06.290 --> 04:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
motion or for a citizen with a warrant
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
article to be able to make that motion
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
and say no we're going to do the
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
municipal Association or or the School
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
Board Association membership but we are
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to have a robust discussion about
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the lobbying efforts and I also want to
 
04:26:22.080 --> 04:26:22.670 align:start position:0%
the lobbying efforts and I also want to
um

04:26:22.670 --> 04:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
touch on what is the distinction between
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
lobbying because and and information
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
because it keeps on getting passed
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
around as far as like there is some
 
04:26:31.680 --> 04:26:32.750 align:start position:0%
around as far as like there is some
confusion

04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
04:26:35.090 --> 04:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
there is no confusion it's written into
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
law what is lobbying and what is not
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
lobbying and lobbying is not giving
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
information you're able to go to the
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
municipal Association whether or not
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
that um you paid for the lobbying
 
04:26:52.010 --> 04:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
to get information from them lobbying is
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
in statute under RSA 15 colon 1 it says
 
04:27:01.550 --> 04:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
to promote or oppose directly or
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
indirectly any legislation
 
04:27:08.689 --> 04:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
so it if you asked the any of these
 
04:27:11.210 --> 04:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
associations a question
 
04:27:14.689 --> 04:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
about not saying whether they oppose or
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
or for the bill but trying to gather
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
information that is not lobbying
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
lobbying is when they say this bill
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
should die or this bill should be be
 
04:27:27.889 --> 04:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
passed that is what is lobbying and and
 
04:27:27.899 --> 04:27:29.689 align:start position:0%
passed that is what is lobbying and and
to

04:27:29.689 --> 04:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
um representative Gilman's question
 
04:27:31.680 --> 04:27:32.809 align:start position:0%
um representative Gilman's question
about

04:27:32.809 --> 04:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:27:32.819 --> 04:27:34.250 align:start position:0%
about
um people

04:27:34.250 --> 04:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
um people
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
um if a selectman or any other person in
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
the town in the in the local officials
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to quote lobby at the
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
State House the this this uh I'm this
 
04:27:50.210 --> 04:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
paragraph is only about the association
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
what the association can do that you're
 
04:27:55.849 --> 04:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
a member of and so if those members are
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
associated uh part of an association
 
04:28:03.649 --> 04:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
then the association has a lobbying arm
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
under current law the the amount the
 
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
money spent on lobbying has to have a
 
04:28:12.170 --> 04:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
separate bank account
 
04:28:15.710 --> 04:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
under current law the the money for for
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
lobbying has to be separate
 
04:28:25.610 --> 04:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
and all this is doing is making that
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
instead of being able to transfer in and
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
out of that separate bank account for
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
lobbying now you have dedicated funds
 
04:28:34.010 --> 04:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
for that lobbying
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that money goes into a bucket for
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
lobbying and so you wouldn't be having
 
04:28:41.570 --> 04:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
this transferring in and out of
 
04:28:43.969 --> 04:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
some amount of money unknown at the time
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
and really what this is coming down to
 
04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
is not about
 
04:28:51.610 --> 04:28:51.620 align:start position:0%
defunding or funding any particular
 
04:28:54.889 --> 04:28:54.899 align:start position:0%
organization it is about giving the the
 
04:28:58.490 --> 04:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
local voters and the local budget
 
04:29:00.769 --> 04:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
committee members the local Selectmen
 
04:29:03.769 --> 04:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to make the decision
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
right now they currently do not have the
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make the decision it's a
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
take it or leave it option right now
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're either part of the N8
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
um the nhma or the School Board
 
04:29:19.370 --> 04:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
Association or the um the clerks
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
Association you you're all in or nothing
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
right now I'm saying that there is some
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
value in the training
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely and so people often want to
 
04:29:33.769 --> 04:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
keep get access to that training but
 
04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
there may be philosophical issues or
 
04:29:38.929 --> 04:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
differences and it's not even at the
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
Town level because the town doesn't have
 
04:29:43.370 --> 04:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
the right to to
 
04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
um to tell nhma that they cannot do some
 
04:29:51.530 --> 04:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
lobbying on some Bill if if my town
 
04:29:54.170 --> 04:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
let's say my Selectmen all vote that
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
they like hb44
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
like they cannot go to the municipal
 
04:30:01.490 --> 04:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
Association and say you cannot Lobby on
 
04:30:03.410 --> 04:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
this right they would have to come here
 
04:30:06.170 --> 04:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
themselves and do their own lobbying on
 
04:30:06.180 --> 04:30:06.950 align:start position:0%
themselves and do their own lobbying on
it

04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:06.960 --> 04:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
it
because

04:30:08.389 --> 04:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:30:12.170 --> 04:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
the majority of towns voted for specific
 
04:30:12.180 --> 04:30:13.670 align:start position:0%
the majority of towns voted for specific
policies

04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
policies
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
whether or not my specific Town agrees
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
with those policies those are the
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
policies and if my my town does not
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
agree with those policies
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they should not be forced to fund
 
04:30:28.610 --> 04:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
them they should be able to come here
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and say no we disagree with those
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
policies and that's why we didn't give
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
them the money this year
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason it could be on any
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
issue it could be on you know uh you
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
know electric charging stations and and
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
requiring electric charging stations the
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
municipality say that's an unfunded
 
04:30:46.490 --> 04:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
mandate we don't like it but maybe
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth really wants to have electric
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
charging stations that that should be
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
their choice and if they don't want to
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
fund that I think you know and they want
 
04:30:57.769 --> 04:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
to come up here and represent themselves
 
04:31:01.090 --> 04:31:01.100 align:start position:0%
I encourage them to do so thank you
 
04:31:35.889 --> 04:31:35.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:39.410 --> 04:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
um and so thank God that the New
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%

04:31:47.530 --> 04:31:47.540 align:start position:0%
there because they gave them the voice
 
04:31:51.410 --> 04:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
they gave them the voice to to the
 
04:31:54.649 --> 04:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
legislature on matters that concerned
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%

04:32:20.769 --> 04:32:20.779 align:start position:0%
I did want to uh agree with
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles on a number of
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
points I was a school board member as
 
04:32:28.610 --> 04:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
well and felt that I was well trained by
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
the School Board Association when I
 
04:32:31.610 --> 04:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
initially became a school board member
 
04:32:34.010 --> 04:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
but I also felt that I was being lobbied
 
04:32:35.929 --> 04:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
for positions that I didn't necessarily
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
hold or the people in my town but also
 
04:32:39.600 --> 04:32:40.849 align:start position:0%
hold or the people in my town but also
um

04:32:40.849 --> 04:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:40.859 --> 04:32:42.170 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:32:42.170 --> 04:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:44.269 --> 04:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
I've seen was the New Hampshire
 
04:32:46.010 --> 04:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association which covers a
 
04:32:48.290 --> 04:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
broad range of topics when I first came
 
04:32:49.849 --> 04:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
on this committee I was like holy cow
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
they really cover the whole topic and
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
since I've been here they seem to
 
04:32:57.170 --> 04:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
represent themselves as far as providers
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
of information not necessarily lobbyists
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
but I also wanted to point out to the
 
04:33:03.050 --> 04:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
committee members that every job that
 
04:33:05.330 --> 04:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
I've ever had in my life I was able to
 
04:33:07.730 --> 04:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
track how many hours I did on one part
 
04:33:10.369 --> 04:33:10.379 align:start position:0%
of my job and another part of my job
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
when I was a project manager I tracked
 
04:33:13.970 --> 04:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
the hours for each project that I
 
04:33:17.449 --> 04:33:17.459 align:start position:0%
managed so and
 
04:33:19.490 --> 04:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know lawyers do that most
 
04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
professional organizations track their
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
hours and assign them to particular
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
projects so I'd say it's it is doable as
 
04:33:28.131 --> 04:33:28.141 align:start position:0%
far as tracking your cost and splitting
 
04:33:29.650 --> 04:33:29.660 align:start position:0%
those costs up
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
but it does take some additional work
 
04:33:39.170 --> 04:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.810 --> 04:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
I wish we wouldn't just look at two
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
groups the municipal Association the
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
school district this bill is going to
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
affect a whole bunch of people and I was
 
04:33:52.970 --> 04:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
just going I'm on the budget Community
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
my time been on for about 30 years and
 
04:33:56.689 --> 04:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
these are some of the groups that we pay
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
for dues for the employees we pay the
 
04:34:00.650 --> 04:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police Chiefs Association
 
04:34:03.051 --> 04:34:03.061 align:start position:0%
Tax Collectors Association the assess
 
04:34:05.949 --> 04:34:05.959 align:start position:0%
Association town clerk Association
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
county attorney's group we've got the
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
association of counties which I'm sure
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
your counties belong to we pay the New
 
04:34:15.410 --> 04:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bob Association we pay the
 
04:34:17.390 --> 04:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
recreational direct to be part of epoxy
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
Rec Association
 
04:34:22.131 --> 04:34:22.141 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sheriff's Association New
 
04:34:23.929 --> 04:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fire Chiefs Association and
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
then we have got a whole bunch of other
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
people other groups that we pay on the
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
national level like National Police
 
04:34:30.650 --> 04:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
achieve police Chiefs and firemen and
 
04:34:32.810 --> 04:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
things like that all these groups are
 
04:34:34.849 --> 04:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
going to be affected by this by this
 
04:34:36.769 --> 04:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
amendment okay it's not just the
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
municipal folks and the school teaches
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be everyone that we that
 
04:34:42.289 --> 04:34:42.299 align:start position:0%
our towns the communities our counties
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
pay for to belong to something
 
04:34:47.209 --> 04:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
and I think it's uh it's unreasonable I
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
I feel it's an attack on those two
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
groups the municipal Association the
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
school teachers and there's other ways
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
of solving the problem on the local
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
level if you want to address it either
 
04:34:58.250 --> 04:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
through a a loan article or you can come
 
04:35:00.410 --> 04:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
into a budget meeting and tell your
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
budget members could you please take
 
04:35:04.609 --> 04:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
this out we don't want to pay for this
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.390 --> 04:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.449 --> 04:35:14.459 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm so upset that I
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
04:35:24.170 --> 04:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have just a couple quick
 
04:35:24.180 --> 04:35:25.670 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have just a couple quick
ones

04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
ones
 
04:35:25.680 --> 04:35:26.810 align:start position:0%
ones
um

04:35:26.810 --> 04:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:27.890 --> 04:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is give you an
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
analogy that I brought up in our caucus
 
04:35:34.609 --> 04:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
this morning about this bill
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
I'm a dues-paying member of 38 years for
 
04:35:41.650 --> 04:35:41.660 align:start position:0%
the pilots Union that I work with
 
04:35:45.289 --> 04:35:45.299 align:start position:0%
and what they do is they segregate the
 
04:35:49.250 --> 04:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
funding between union dues which goes
 
04:35:53.230 --> 04:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
for the education contract compliance
 
04:35:56.330 --> 04:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
training a lot of things that the pilots
 
04:35:57.890 --> 04:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
Union do
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
but they also have
 
04:36:02.689 --> 04:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
a pack
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
political action committee
 
04:36:09.769 --> 04:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
which is used specifically for lobbying
 
04:36:13.250 --> 04:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
that part of our the dues although we're
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
a you know you can be a member or not
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
you still pay a portion of your dues
 
04:36:19.609 --> 04:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
even if you're not a member I've been in
 
04:36:22.609 --> 04:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
full who's paying for 38 years
 
04:36:28.010 --> 04:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.131 --> 04:36:31.141 align:start position:0%
the pilots aren't always as a lot of
 
04:36:32.090 --> 04:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that have been
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
brought up are not always on board with
 
04:36:36.890 --> 04:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
sometimes where our Union goes you can
 
04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
go in and out of the pack you can you
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
know you can start your contributions
 
04:36:44.330 --> 04:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
you can stop your contributions but it's
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
it is segregated
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
um I personally like that I do pay for
 
04:36:51.529 --> 04:36:51.539 align:start position:0%
my pack because that is specifically for
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
lobbying and I believe we get
 
04:36:56.929 --> 04:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
value out of that I will say there was a
 
04:36:58.849 --> 04:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
two-year period where I would stop
 
04:37:01.369 --> 04:37:01.379 align:start position:0%
paying because I didn't like where they
 
04:37:03.289 --> 04:37:03.299 align:start position:0%
were going
 
04:37:03.299 --> 04:37:04.070 align:start position:0%
were going
um

04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:06.769 --> 04:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
I don't somebody mentioned uh you know
 
04:37:07.970 --> 04:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
lobbyist is bad word I don't see
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
lobbyists as a bad word at all
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this is where this
 
04:37:14.631 --> 04:37:14.641 align:start position:0%
bill goes the bill is going simply to
 
04:37:18.109 --> 04:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
separate the two pots of money which I
 
04:37:20.689 --> 04:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
do not disagree with
 
04:37:20.699 --> 04:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
do not disagree with
um

04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
the last thing and it kind of goes along
 
04:37:25.131 --> 04:37:25.141 align:start position:0%
with the my analogy of my Pilots Union
 
04:37:27.131 --> 04:37:27.141 align:start position:0%
it's not all
 
04:37:30.170 --> 04:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
towns want or need the same thing
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
especially if you've got cities like
 
04:37:35.689 --> 04:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua their needs and wants
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
may be different than
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
my town of Barrington or representative
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
Brown's Town of moultonborough or
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's Town up in Cross County
 
04:37:45.840 --> 04:37:47.390 align:start position:0%
somebody's Town up in Cross County
so

04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:50.449 --> 04:37:50.459 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see this as attack I don't
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
see this attack on anybody in this room
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
or anybody that comes before us at all
 
04:37:57.410 --> 04:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
it to me it is a way of segregating out
 
04:37:59.810 --> 04:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
the funds I'm not opposed to that so I
 
04:38:03.730 --> 04:38:03.740 align:start position:0%
will vote in favor of it thank you
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%

04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
49 bills and as of today we believe it

or not are completed which is to me well
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
done I would also like to say I was very
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
suspicious on doing 18 bills today
 
04:44:08.690 --> 04:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
we were able to get
 
04:44:11.330 --> 04:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
18 bills exact which is uh very very
 
04:44:11.340 --> 04:44:12.708 align:start position:0%
18 bills exact which is uh very very
good

04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:44:12.718 --> 04:44:14.868 align:start position:0%
good
um

04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
I would expect next week we have two
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
days of sessions uh house sessions I
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
would expect to be see some of our bills
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
from last week that we execed on
 
04:44:31.250 --> 04:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
on at least one of the two days I'm not
 
04:44:34.368 --> 04:44:34.378 align:start position:0%
sure which day that'll be uh once once
 
04:44:35.810 --> 04:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
that is published that will be published
 
04:44:37.610 --> 04:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
tomorrow night
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
what we'll need to do is get together on

04:44:46.970 --> 04:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis and I and we'll
 
04:44:48.650 --> 04:44:48.660 align:start position:0%

04:46:33.490 --> 04:46:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
04:46:39.850 --> 04:46:39.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I hate to be the
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
naysayer but I feel very offended for
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
not being recognized it's it's almost
 
04:46:47.520 --> 04:46:49.190 align:start position:0%
not being recognized it's it's almost
like

04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's gotten to me that this will be the
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
last time I'll be in this committee
 
04:46:57.890 --> 04:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
because it's somehow I feel singled out
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
by you every time I raise my hand it
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
looked the other way and I'm always the
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
last person to be recognized and it's
 
04:47:12.288 --> 04:47:12.298 align:start position:0%
really very personal to me and I've been
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
invisible and I'm sorry
 
04:47:19.610 --> 04:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
to say that but it's really affected I
 
04:47:22.128 --> 04:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
had a healthy issue I put aside that
 
04:47:23.930 --> 04:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
came today
 
04:47:27.050 --> 04:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
to be part because I know that's my duty
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
to my constituents and
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
sorry but I needed to express that at
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
the cost of my health I'm here today and
 
04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was treated that badly
 
04:47:43.310 --> 04:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the comment uh
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative um as you've seen
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the year I have a method of
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
who is called and when is called I
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
alternate you'll see me all the time I
 
04:47:56.990 --> 04:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
alternate my head to the right and the
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
left the individuals who have spoken
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
once I allow others to speak before
 
04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
somebody speaks twice
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I think I've been extremely fair in
 
04:48:13.788 --> 04:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
how I allocate the those who speak I
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
also have mentioned before at previous
 
04:48:19.010 --> 04:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
meetings that
 
04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
I prefer at times to have if I see
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who doesn't speak frequently I
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
would like to hear them speak
 
04:48:31.310 --> 04:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
and I always do I prefer to have them
 
04:48:32.770 --> 04:48:32.780 align:start position:0%
speak first
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
and then I always get to everybody at
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
some point so I don't think there's any
 
04:48:44.090 --> 04:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
certainly any intent to exclude anybody
 
04:48:46.970 --> 04:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
everybody has spoken one
 
04:48:53.050 --> 04:48:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
sure representative 11. thanks
 
04:48:56.218 --> 04:49:00.948 align:start position:0%
sure representative 11. thanks
um

04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.958 --> 04:49:02.868 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:49:06.050 --> 04:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
think representative man dupudi has a
 
04:49:08.930 --> 04:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
point and it might be where she sits
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
because both of us are served in the
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
corner over here
 
04:49:15.650 --> 04:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and it might be another reason but I
 
04:49:17.330 --> 04:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
04:49:19.190 --> 04:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
I have to disagree with you a little bit
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and I unders I understand her
 
04:49:24.410 --> 04:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
feelings of feeling excluded and not
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
listened to so my suggestion to you
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be that you have a personal
 
04:49:30.890 --> 04:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
conversation with her and and hear the
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
whole thing out
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
because we know your intentions are good
 
04:49:37.250 --> 04:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
when we disagree we disagree and that's
 
04:49:40.128 --> 04:49:40.138 align:start position:0%
fine that's what we're supposed to do
 
04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
um but she's she's received a message
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
that you say you aren't sending so that
 
04:49:48.590 --> 04:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
needs to get square between the two of
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
you is what I think I would note that
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
what I just discussed
 
04:49:55.730 --> 04:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
reps the representative who made the
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
comments was not even in the room she
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
vacated the room I I understand all
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
right yeah with that thanks
