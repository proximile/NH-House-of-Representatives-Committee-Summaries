00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 align:start position:0%
 
like

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to welcome all the members of
 
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
the public to our hearings today the
 
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
first hearing is 464 prior to getting
 
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
into that message for the committee
 
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
um when I was a school principal we had
 
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
what we call the Sunshine fund and that
 
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
was a fund to try and get enough
 
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
coffee out there and and where we picked
 
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
up the money for that too so we're going
 
00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
to be wanting to discuss that in terms
 
00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
of can it if if everybody contribute a
 
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
little bit to the plot then we can be
 
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
paying off the costs of bringing the
 
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
coffee and because that's all on us and
 
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
if you're not a coffee drinker don't
 
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
worry about it but uh we buy
 
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
there might be tea it might be hot
 
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
chocolate whatever so uh it'd be nice if
 
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
we could just put a little jar out there
 
00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
and if you have a little bit of
 
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
something you might want to put it in
 
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
there it can be put in anytime
 
00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
um so we've also used those monies at
 
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
times when we have had get-togethers you
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
know and and we had to book a place or
 
00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 align:start position:0%
something like to have a dinner together
 
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
which is a nice thing to do as a total
 
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
committee Rick is that the same fund
 
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
that where the five dollars goes if your
 
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
cell phone goes off during a session
 
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right and and I want to
 
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
reinforce that
 
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
and it's non-lapsing it's it just
 
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
continues you're right representative
 
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.970 align:start position:0%
continues you're right representative
um

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
well we have a performance audit done it
 
00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
I do it and and so at any rate so
 
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 align:start position:0%
um it will be out there uh and you might
 
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the time to turn your
 
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
phones off right now because if we hear
 
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
it going off there's a little bit that
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
goes in the kitty and we'll discuss what
 
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
the rules are going to be if it's going
 
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
to be five bucks it used to be that you
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
had to pay for a meal for us oh and that
 
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
was huge dollars so you learned it
 
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 align:start position:0%
quickly to turn it off so with that um
 
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
information didn't really need it for
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the public but took advantage of the
 
00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
time so we have 464 on the docket this
 
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
morning this is relative to eligible
 
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
students in the education Freedom
 
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
account program and the prime sponsor is
 
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
before us right now I like to well
 
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
welcome Erica land representative lamb
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
to present her Bill thank you Mr
 
00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning members of the
 
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
House Education committee I'm so glad
 
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
that I had the opportunity to serve with
 
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
you the first year of last term for the
 
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
record I am Erica Leon and I have the
 
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
honor of representing Dairy I am here
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
today to introduce House Bill 464 which
 
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
expands eligibility for the education
 
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts to a number of
 
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
different marginalized groups
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
we currently offer students and families
 
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
which make up to three times the federal
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
poverty limit level the opportunity to
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
use a state portion of their school
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
funding to follow them to an education
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
option of choice
 
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
while many of the students in the
 
00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
following categories qualify based on
 
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
income that is not guaranteed and the
 
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
experience of a relatively more
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
well-to-do student in these
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances can be even more isolating
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
let me give you some examples as I share
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
the categories
 
00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
Foster kit children are thrust into the
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
foster care system for many reasons and
 
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 align:start position:0%
extending the EFA will help a student
 
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
who is already attending a private
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
school keep that crucial consistency
 
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 align:start position:0%
while their world drastically changes
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
migratory child migratory workers
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
include field bosses not just field
 
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
hands and I for one don't want to
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
discriminate against the children of
 
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
migratory workers who earn more than
 
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
three times the poverty level level
 
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
homeless child homeless lists can come
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
catastrophically after a family
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
financial disaster or a house fire just
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
as a foster child already attending a
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
private school should not lose their
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
school along with their family these
 
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
homeless students should not lose their
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
school along with their home
 
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 align:start position:0%
children of active duty service members
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
their parents wrote a blank check to our
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
country up to and including their lives
 
00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 align:start position:0%
and we don't know if that check is going
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
to be cashed these students deserve some
 
00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:09.830 align:start position:0%
to be cashed these students deserve some
choice

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
English language learners
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
our educational system has learned a lot
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
about teaching most English language
 
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
learners but those on both extremes
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
still struggle very low skilled students
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
I know these students my mom actually
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
taught kids who immigrated from villages
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
in Mexico that had no written language
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the standard ell programs don't work
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
with those kids but being able to
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
individualize it works sometimes that
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
happens in the school system sometimes
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
they need other options and then very
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
high academic skills students they'd
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
benefit from individualized immersive
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
English while they can continue to
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
achieve their academic process progress
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
in their native language while building
 
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
up both sets of skills so that they can
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
perform well in English
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
persistently bullied students if a
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
student is persistently bullied they
 
00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
definitely deserve an Escape Plan well
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
an Escape Plan other than dropping out
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately happens too often
 
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
neurodivergent children often don't do
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
well in a standard classroom they need a
 
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
more personalized approach to learning
 
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
one that can accommodate their learning
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
differences allowing these students to
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
take their state portion of funding with
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
them to a better educational fit will
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
save the local school district the
 
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
tremendous cost of trying to replicate
 
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
the environment that is naturally found
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
at many learning cooperatives
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
a student with a documented manifest
 
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
educational hardship these students are
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
already leaving their local school for a
 
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
better academic fit allowing these
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
students access to EFA funds broadens
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
their options and it relieves the school
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
district of the cost of an out of
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
District placement
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
a student in an underperforming school
 
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
is defined in statutes schools in the
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
bottom five percent of the state and
 
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
high schools that graduate fewer than 69
 
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
percent of students over two consecutive
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
years meet this definition well I have
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
compassion for these schools I have more
 
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
compassion for these students who may be
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
missing out on an education those who
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
want another option should have access
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
to EFA funds to do so
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
a student assigned to a persistently
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
dangerous School
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
no student should be forced to attend a
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
persistently dangerous School these kids
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
definitely need access and finally any
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
student who's eligible for a free or
 
00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
reduced price meal I know that right now
 
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
these levels are below our income
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
eligibility but I believe that if a
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
family is determined to be in need of a
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
subsidized lunch then they also deserve
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to have their State dollars
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
follow their student
 
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a referendum on the EFA
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
program this bill provides access to
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
some students who are marginalized and
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
face challenges
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
many speak of systemic oppression it
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
comes in so many shapes and sizes that
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
no one thing can fix it but this can
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
extend a branch to some students who
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
don't fit in the system and they need
 
00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
don't fit in the system and they need
out

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
small learning groups can accommodate
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
students in a way that a school system
 
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
never can
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
by necessity we build our schools our
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
curriculum and our schedules for average
 
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
students and then we add as many
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
supports as we can for those who perform
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
below the level and we hope that those
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
are performing above will make it
 
00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:15.409 align:start position:0%
are performing above will make it
anyways

00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
educational groups of choice and private
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
schools can meet the needs of student
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
well educational groups of choice more
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
than private schools in my experience
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
but they can meet the needs of students
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
as individuals unless it's a small
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
private school honoring what makes them
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
special and building the foundation that
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
they need to succeed in life
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking you today is if these
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
students deserve to take their state
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
funding to a different option Foster
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
kits migratory and homeless kids active
 
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
duty military kits English language
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
Learners persistently bullied kids and
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
those with a documented manifest
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
educational hardship children with a
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
disability and students in low
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
performing or dangerous schools
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
I believe that these students deserve
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
whatever options we can offer them and
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
letting their state funding follow them
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
is only fair I ask that the opposition
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
to this bill tell me and these students
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
which of these students don't deserve
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have their state
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
funds follow them for Choice thank you
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
aren't these students already available
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
for cfas
 
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question not every
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
student is available for these you could
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
look at a foster student who's come from
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
a higher income family and was attending
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
a private school something catastrophic
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
happens in their life where suddenly
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
they need to be placed in a foster
 
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.910 align:start position:0%
they need to be placed in a foster
family

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:49.019 align:start position:0%
they've already had their world shifted
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
we should be able to offer those EFA
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
funds for them to continue that or
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
whichever educational option they were
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
how about the other students
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
um there are many of those students are
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
I would hope that our active duty
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
service members are above the income
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
threshold those families definitely make
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of sacrifice for us English
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
language Learners are not limited to
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
just one income group there are some
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
that make more money and some of those
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
may be higher performance students some
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
of them may be lower performing students
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
and they may need more intensive focus
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
on English and then separately on
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
academics so that both can improve and
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
they don't end up behind a grade level I
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
have some experience with that since my
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
mother spoke in uh school and taught in
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
a school that had a very very high
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
immigrant population and over two-thirds
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the students were English language
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
Learners it took a very special process
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
to get these kids up to speed the kids
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
that spoke Spanish did a better job but
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
those with tug log and other languages
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
that were less common had a much harder
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
time building up both their English
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
skills and their academic skills without
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
having learning losses
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification thank
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you very much
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative lamb for for joining us
 
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:09.500 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
exactly what's preventing these students
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
from getting a voucher right now
 
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question not every
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
student in these categories make is in a
 
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
family that makes or makes at or below
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
300 of the federal poverty level and a
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair yes and how much is
 
00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:28.009 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair yes and how much is
that

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
I don't remember the number offhand
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
um do any members of the can I can I get
 
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
a clarification well and at the end
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
maybe tactical but this you know we're
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to limit it to two questions right
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
now okay because I believe that's about
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
140 000 a year it is not that high
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
unless you have a family of eight or
 
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
nine somewhere around 86
 
00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339 align:start position:0%
000 86.87s I recall
 
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
see if you were talking if you were
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
talking greater numbers you would be up
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
to a hundred eleven thousand dollars but
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
that's that's a different category
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
yes representative could you just
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
clarify what you just said 86 000 is
 
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
which percent that's the 300 percent
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
now don't quote me on that exactly
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's a family of four okay are there
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
Liam yes representative uh woodcock
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair appreciate it good
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
morning good morning
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going back to for my own
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
notification here on line six of the uh
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
document on the aggressive it's up to
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
300 percent what are the currently that
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
is the current law the current law right
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
now okay so my question deals so it's
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
not an expansion of the 300 percent it's
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
just to that level
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
um the question deals actually with line
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
eight and
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
um where you you had in your bill free
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch folks uh and those
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
students uh those entitlement students
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
have to reapply every every year for
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
free and reduced categories to be
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
certified uh most entitlement programs
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
in the state have to recertify every
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
single year my question is
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
if if students or parents or students
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
who who are now at the 300 threshold and
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
make the uh appropriate documentation
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
and their income goes above the
 
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.430 align:start position:0%
and their income goes above the
threshold

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
then as they move down why why should be
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
why should we be funding that I said at
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
least minimally recertify every year
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't understand I don't
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
understand why we exclude them from
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
recertifying every year like any other
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
entitlement program
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question and
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services we're dealing
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
with the Medicare Medicaid Cliff problem
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
we don't want to create a cliff problem
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
here in the education Freedom accounts
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
and this is actually the current law I
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
know at least 12 families myself that
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
are within a hundred or a thousand
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
dollars of that and they're worried that
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they need to recertify that the
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
question is are they going to make
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
marginally more and then end up costing
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
their family more by not having this in
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
order to provide the educational
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
services that are helping their children
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
Thrive do we want families to limit
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
their income so that they continue to
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
qualify for programs or do we want both
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
the families and the students to thrive
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
oh I want to thank you
 
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
oh I want to thank you
um

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to debate if that issue if
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
we want them not them I do know that we
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
have every every panel program has a
 
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
Line in the Sand uh every driver's
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
license has a Line in the Sand every uh
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
can you put that in the form of a
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
question please where yes yes sir thank
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate that
 
00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:48.110 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate that
um

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
if every driver no okay um the point is
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
the point of the question is that why
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
should any one particular group be
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
entitled not to create or recreate that
 
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
certification every year on every other
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
entitled program that we all use for
 
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
anything it just goes eligible to
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
ineligible right so this particular
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
program we say nope you don't have to do
 
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.490 align:start position:0%
program we say nope you don't have to do
that

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you there's another bill that
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
deals with that but the state adequacy
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
Grant going to Public Schools is not
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
limited by income I'm not sure why we
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
would limit it here either
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you and
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
clarification on the amount if you had
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
400 percent of the four family that's
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
111 000 as I stated if you're at 300 I
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
believe it's down around 83 000 for a
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
family for a family of four
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
yes represent Drive
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
um what's the current status of
 
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
schooling ability for homeless children
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
and are there high schools that meet
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
this um dangerous uh standard in New
 
00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.350 align:start position:0%
this um dangerous uh standard in New
Hampshire

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
um thank you currently homeless students
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
go to the I believe it's either the
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
school district that they were in when
 
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
they lost their home or that that they
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
are in I don't know 100 but I know we
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussed it and we've discussed it
 
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.009 align:start position:0%
discussed it and we've discussed it
before

00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
um that's actually a good one to look
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
into and make sure that these students
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
needs are being met not just through
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
efas but through the public school too
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the high school yes
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
um the high school is very dangerous
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
High School
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any options for students
 
00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
that are in a persistently dangerous
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
school are there any that are
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes well are there any currently
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
designated that way
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I I apologize I did not look to see
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
if we currently do but I hope we don't
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
that would be a terrible thing to have a
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
persistently dangerous School here in
 
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
the state but if that does happen it
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
would be good to give those students a
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
way out
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you that that information is
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
governed by Statute and you can get the
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
answer to your question if you contact
 
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.650 align:start position:0%
answer to your question if you contact
Doe

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
Doe
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
further question representative Belcher
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
um in in current
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
um funding for EFA programs there's
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that would link
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
um those uh dollar amounts to qualify to
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh inflation levels is there
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question that's the
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
state adequacy aid so that's something
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
that is calculated separately in the
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
budget each year so that is something
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's dictated for all students who
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
attend public school charter school is a
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
slightly different calculation and then
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
for those students that qualify for the
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
EFA so we set that on each year oh each
 
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
EFA so we set that on each year oh each
biennium

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
adequacy set by the biennium
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
thank you further further questions from
 
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question my
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
question is that a lot of these
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
categories that you have up here
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
um would require special services
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and is there anything that a private
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
school that takes a voucher are they
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
prepared to and do they have those
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
services available that ESL students
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
would need or emotional services for the
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
bully students
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
or even going on to you know
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
students with learning disabilities
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's a that runs the gamut so just
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
um this is these aren't vouchers this is
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
money that goes into account to pay for
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
whichever educational service provider
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
is determined by the parents to meet
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
their child's need so they will go
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
looking to figure out which one it is I
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
know a family that's not an EFA program
 
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
family but they have a child with
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
significant learning disabilities and so
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
they are paying out of pocket for an ot
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
to work with their student and a student
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
that was basically decided to be
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
uneducable through this intensive work
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
and then Family Support is actually
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
performing only a couple grade levels
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
behind and she was essentially
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
considered a lost cause by the school
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
system our schools are really really
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
resource constrained when we have aides
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
that are coming in to be one-on-one a
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
lot of that is to try and get things
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
back into more of a small group adaptive
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
learning process when you're starting
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
out in a small group where you have
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
maybe six or seven students in some sort
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
of Learning Center working together
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
those individual differences both teach
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
the children how to work with with
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
people with different needs and it also
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
supports those students that otherwise
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
would need intensive supports in a class
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
of 16 to 25 students but in a very small
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
group that's able to naturally be part
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
of the educational process I can tell
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
you not every single student will
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily find that provider outside
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the school system but this isn't a
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
one-way process any family can go back
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
to their public school if they find that
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
they're not having their needs met and
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
so they always have that option of
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
returning if they cannot find better
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
services that better meet their needs
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
and I would bet those families would be
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
really really appreciative of what the
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
schools do when they started off
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
frustrated when they left the school
 
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.690 align:start position:0%
frustrated when they left the school
system

00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to remind everybody
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
in the committee we need to address
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
questions relative to this bill
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh vfa law is in statute right now
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is not putting EFA
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
in statute this is
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
identifying additional categories which
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
would qualify uh for the efas let's try
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
to keep it there
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
um any further questions for the
 
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.409 align:start position:0%
um any further questions for the
representative

00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you I'd like
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
to call forward uh representative Lauren
 
00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:39.770 align:start position:0%
to call forward uh representative Lauren
selig

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you for
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
seating me quickly so I can get to my
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
own hearings um I am representative
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
Lauren selig I am also a parent of two
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
kids in the Oyster River School System
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
and I oppose this bill
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and increasing the eligibility for
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
um these students there are a number of
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
items that were listed talking about
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
special education talking about ESL
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
these are programs that are already
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
currently being defunded by the voucher
 
00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:07.909 align:start position:0%
currently being defunded by the voucher
program

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
um and continuing to take money out of
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
our public school system by funding kids
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
going to programs where there's no
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
accountability there's no certification
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
there's no monitoring to ensure that
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
these children are in fact getting any
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
of the education that we're
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
presumably paying for doesn't serve
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
anyone's purpose currently vouchers
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
receive uh seven thousand dollar over
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars per student
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
um as the justification and so if that's
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
the case I don't understand where the
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
justification comes to only provide
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
public schools with four thousand
 
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
dollars per student in terms of state
 
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.990 align:start position:0%
dollars per student in terms of state
aid

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
um you know we need to live up to our
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement to fund
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
adequate education for all students
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
across the state not just pull uh money
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
for people who decide to pull their kids
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
out of the public school system as a
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
parent of special needs child I know
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
that the private schools in my area
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
often do not actually provide any
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
support because they are not required to
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
by federal law in the same way that the
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
public school system is it allows for a
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
significant lack of balance between the
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
two having also taught in a public
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
school system where I taught in an ESL
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's an ESL program in my school we
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
housed 45 different languages
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
students Thrive when they are provided
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
collaborative education in those
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
settings I cannot tell you how many of
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
my ESL students transitioned into my
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
regular English classes and went on to
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
go to incredibly challenging four-year
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
colleges go into the US military go into
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
career paths and become incredibly
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
successful without needing to pull money
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
out of public school systems in order to
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
do that thank you thank you very much
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative representative cordelli
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
representative for being here
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I I think you I heard you say that
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
um was it ESL programs and special
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
education programs are being defunded
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
because of this program I was just
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
wondering I hadn't seen any information
 
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
your source of your information it's not
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
specifically those programs the more
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
that we continue to pull money out of
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
our public school system to send to
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
private schools that have no
 
00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:13.850 align:start position:0%
private schools that have no
requirements

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and and theoretically public charter
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
schools that are actually run by private
 
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.310 align:start position:0%
schools that are actually run by private
entities

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
um the more that we continue to do that
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
and pull the funds out of our Public
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
School System the less funding there is
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
available for ESL programs for art
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
programs for physical education for all
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
the rest of the programs that our
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
students need you have a follow-up
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
 
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.529 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
um

00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just wondering uh I'm not
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
familiar with any private
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
charter schools in New Hampshire they're
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
Public Schools but the public charter
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
schools but the organizations that are
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
getting the money are not necessarily
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
public organizations they are
 
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:49.730 align:start position:0%
public organizations they are
um

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
there are several of them and there are
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
other people who probably can give you
 
00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:54.539 align:start position:0%
more accurate information than I can but
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
that are actually sponsored by private
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
entities there's a new one attempting to
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
start an Exeter that's called the 1776
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
Foundation school for example which
 
00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059 align:start position:0%
um is is theoretically a public charter
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
except that it's the curriculum is all
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
being purchased at very high cost from a
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
private organization
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um being newer to
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
this committee I obviously have a lot to
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
learn about the various distinctions so
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
when you bring up the distinction
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
between uh Public School versus a
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
charter school is is the distinction as
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing it correctly that the public
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
school is government run versus the the
 
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:37.820 align:start position:0%
charter is private organization run
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
technically charter schools are public
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
schools as well they're started and
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
again I'm not that foremost expert I
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
know we've got experts in the room
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
who'll be able to answer this better
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
than I can um but um there are there are
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
public schools that theoretically
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
specialize in something
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
um but they students who go there it
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
takes money out of our Public School our
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
our town schools for example to go to
 
00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:05.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
just a brief follow-up so but the
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
distinction there is is government-run
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
versus private run is that is that
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
correct basically I don't believe
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
they're necessarily private run but
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
they're run by a um in I think by
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
interest groups primarily okay thank you
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not an expert in other
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative luno thank you
 
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and thank you very much for your uh
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning and offering
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
your testimony and uh um just a question
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
are you aware that uh seven out of the
 
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
seven out of ten of the lowest
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
performing schools in New Hampshire are
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
um I I am aware of that I I think it's
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
not seeing you thank you very much thank
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman yeah okay
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah a little bit of cursive training
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
here yeah I went to a public school I'm
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I was it was uh low performing
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
and I struggled
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to set my my clock and um try
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
and do my three minutes but I I hope
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
um first my name is Campbell and I
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to sit where you
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
guys are sitting uh for a number of
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
years two decades ago and interestingly
 
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
the the conversations the Dynamics and
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
the thought processes really haven't
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
changed that much
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
um it's uh you know the unions are up
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
front protesting
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
one party saying one thing that's a
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
little off skew and other party's saying
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
another thing
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
um so I'm really here to hopefully touch
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
your heart and touch your mind I think
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's time for a grand compromise to be
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
made this bill does a lot of good things
 
00:26:56.769 --> 00:26:56.779 align:start position:0%
by expanding the opportunities
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
for children to be availed the adequate
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
the adequate education grant that we're
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
constitutionally and through lawsuits
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
obligated to give students
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
that obligation is not just for students
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
who are in a government-run school that
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
obligation is not just for students who
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
attend a union organized educational
 
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.450 align:start position:0%
attend a union organized educational
environment

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I had the opportunity to sit in a
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee when I was on this this
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
thing I had the opportunity to pass
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
legislation that I sponsored and that
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is pretty much the education
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
funding formula that you're dealing with
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
today we target eight small communities
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm from Farmington we're a poor
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
Community one of the lowest and as a
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
state representative after I passed
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislation in a bipartisan way we got
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
over two million dollars more
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
and back then our budget was about 14
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
it was significant
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
um I want to support public education
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
education is a great equalizer
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
but we have to realize that students are
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
entitled to their adequate education
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
grant period
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
I try to pass another bill with an
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant where we
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
understood that it was a constitutional
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
obligation just follow the student
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
wherever they went it was just that
 
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
wherever they went it was just that
simple

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
we missed passing the house by one vote
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
that was 20 years ago and I'm happy that
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
over the 20 years we now have you know
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
education scholarship programs we have
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
this EFA program and we have a mechanism
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances for the
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant that the kids
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
are entitled to to follow them
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
I've also since I was here was involved
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
in private schools I'm the father of my
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
children uh I'm Catholic involved in my
 
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
faith although probably a wretched
 
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.610 align:start position:0%
faith although probably a wretched
Center

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:45.620 align:start position:0%
Center
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
I also had the opportunity this last
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
year to start a non-profit called Seton
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
foundation and we started a private
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
Catholic school after the Catholics go
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
in our town closed and that school
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
closed because we fiscally discriminate
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
against anyone other than a
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
government-run union-organized school
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
environment we fiscally discriminate
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
when I mispassing that bill by one vote
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
I walked out of the house and two reps
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
in front of me said I'm glad we defeated
 
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
that the Catholics won't get our money
 
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
now look I'm not saying that we're
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
horribly discriminated against but it's
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
still happening today
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.710 align:start position:0%
we need to have
um

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
this bill passed because it'll give
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to come to
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
Seton Academy and guess what we have
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
children's with with ifps we have
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
children with modified learning programs
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
they have children's with with second
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
language in our town Rochester school
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
district provides Aid to us for any kids
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
that have an IEP that's current law
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
you should support this bill and and
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
widening those environments and if you
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
were ever going to make a change to this
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill or kill it just get rid of the 300
 
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.350 align:start position:0%
bill or kill it just get rid of the 300
percent

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's blatantly illegal my daughter
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and her husband have one child you
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
know so it's 65 000 they make just over
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
that and they pay six thousand dollars a
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
year and that's almost that's over ten
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
percent of their income it's almost 20
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
of their income and their income is
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
probably at you know eighty five
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year they both work
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
long hours and hard days and they make
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
that sacrifice so these kids that are
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
just starting out and they have a little
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
four-year-old that they want to provide
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
a really good environment because they
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
know they both didn't do well in the
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
Farmington School District
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
that's all they shouldn't have to choose
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
such a extreme impact on their budget
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
it's these people just over the poverty
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
level at 400 or 500 percent of the
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
poverty level that you're hurting the
 
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:46.340 align:start position:0%
most so this bill expands opportunities
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
for different groups which I think makes
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
sense I don't think my daughter would
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
fall into any of those groups so I'll
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
talk about the next bill next but I'll
 
00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:57.140 align:start position:0%
wrap up with please support this bill
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
please you know people on both sides of
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
the alley have lunch together talk to
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
each other see if there's a grand
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
compromise that you can make see if you
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
can get rid of the income limit and
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
maybe have a little bit of that
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
education funding Grant stay in the stay
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
in the public school I'm not sitting
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
here throwing rocks in the window at
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
Public Schools what I'm saying is my
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
child and my children and future
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
Generations because if you say on the
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
current cast and you don't do something
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
all these private schools are going to
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
close just like the one that I was
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
involved in with 20 years they closed
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then there's no opportunity so we've
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
got to support people to make choices so
 
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
that there's Market response for good
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
educational environments we we had to
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
get all the licensing we had to get all
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
the approvals
 
00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:42.419 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fully licensed public school
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
that I started
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
I don't like it when people say anything
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
other than the truth I think so thank
 
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:51.260 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
could you please explain your last
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
statement how is your newly funded I
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
mean newly founded Catholic School a
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
public school I don't understand that
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
because I think it's a lot of confusing
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
when we when we founded the school we
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
had to go to the Department of Education
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
we had to meet all of these requirements
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
to open up what they do label a private
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
school but our school is open to the
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
public it's contexted in a public place
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's conducted in a public environment
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
we have a publicly open available
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
building anyone can come to our school
 
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
this is not an exclusive thing and we
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
get a lot of kids that are on this
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
program we have about 30 kids right now
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
in our first year we have 35 kids
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
committed for next year and I have a
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of families that are just
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
over that income limit that may qualify
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
under this bill for some of the other
 
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
expanded criteria which I appreciate
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
um that but none of our stuff we're not
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
unlicensed we're not meeting a standard
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
we follow all the rules and regulations
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education gave us
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
and we had to get approved and licensed
 
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:09.419 align:start position:0%
to operate in the public assay school
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
just like a daycare or you know we have
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
a license to be an educational
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
environment and sometimes it's just like
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
oh they don't follow all we do and
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's when I say public that's exactly
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
what I mean what we don't have is Union
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
teachers and Union aides we don't have a
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
union environment but we have very I
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
think a very talented staff and you know
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
actually the teacher of the year in New
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in our school it's a
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing we we have a very good
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
environment and it's open to the public
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden thank you Mr
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for my question just
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
pertains to the level of Education of
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
the teachers are they all certified and
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
licensed through the department of Ed
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
yes thank you further questions yes
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Miss Mr chair
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here and
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
regarding the school The Seton Academy
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
um so it's designated a Catholic School
 
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:06.620 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise because obviously in
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools being Catholic isn't a
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm just curious as to you
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you know the percentage that are I
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
would say antidotically because we don't
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
we don't ask that question whether
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
you're Catholic or not but I can tell
 
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
you of the kids that we have I would say
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're about 50 50 that it's it's a
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
pretty balanced environment
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
um my adopted grandson for instance is
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
not Catholic and his father's
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
non-catholic but they're in that
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
environment so I would say it's at least
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
50 50 it may actually be more kids are
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
not Catholic but we are a Catholic
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
school and we don't exempt kids out if
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
we go to mass you know we have a every
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
school environment should have a moral
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
compass you know every government runs
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
school and I'll say government run
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
instead of public because there's
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
confusion on that definition but every
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
government-run school has a mission
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
statement they have a set of guidelines
 
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:08.339 align:start position:0%
that you follow they have a standard of
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
conduct that they expect from their kids
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
as they should
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
we just have that same thing and then
 
00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
our our thing we actualize our religious
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
freedom to bring Jesus Christ into it
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
and to bring a 2 000 year old religious
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
tradition into their lives that helps
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
people have a framework
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
um that I think will guide them for the
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives I know it has for me
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
um I went to public school until
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
sophomore year and then uh got in a
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
little bit of trouble and they in the
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
80s they would send you a Catholic
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
school if you got in trouble so uh I
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
spent three years at St Thomas and and
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
got to explore my faith a little bit
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
more and it and it changed the whole
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
trajectory of my life and and that's the
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
point that every environment isn't a
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
perfect fit for every student so give
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
these students the freedom they deserve
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
give them the opportunity to have these
 
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.890 align:start position:0%
give them the opportunity to have these
other

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:56.900 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
environments out there
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question thank you
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
yes represent Woodcock thank you Mr
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
chairman uh good morning uh Marvel uh a
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
question for you guys your curriculum uh
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
do your students in your school uh do
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
they take religious education is it
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the curriculum that all
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
the religious education is immersed
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
meaning that we're we're authentically
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
Catholic environment so we don't
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
separate it out and say oh in fifth
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
period you have religious education
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's not the way it works we use
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
Singapore Math we had a very uh a very
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh detailed curriculum committee a very
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
detailed curriculum process and we have
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
a very good curriculum I wasn't on the
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
curriculum committee but I will tell you
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
that our Catholic moral values aren't
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
separated out in math class you know
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
meaning meaning that that we don't say
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
there was you know two Apostles met two
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
Apostles how many apostles do you have
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that I'm just saying that
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
that it's not
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's not the right it's not the
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
right question to ask we don't we don't
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
say we only study like if you had a
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
government-run school and you had
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
Western sieve and you took West and Sid
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
fifth period it's not like you take
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
religion fifth period does that make
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
sense yes I was asking if you had a
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
specific instruction in your curriculum
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
what you're saying it's integrated
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
through all your courses
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have religious education
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum absolutely so we might be
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
studying the New Testament one day we
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
study a lot of Latin we study a lot of
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
different types of prayers we do
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
catechesis of the Good Shepherd is is in
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
the Pre-K level
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you know I can talk to you a little
 
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
bit more about that thank you so within
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
your curriculum thank you Mr chairman
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh yes represent

Allison oh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question all right you
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
started off by indicating that the
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
unions were protesting out front of this
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
building which unions were you talking
 
00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:01.490 align:start position:0%
building which unions were you talking
about

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't know which unions they belong
 
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.890 align:start position:0%
um I don't know which unions they belong
to

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much thank you for the
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
questions Nancy thank you very much for
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you all very much
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning Mr chair and
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
having me I'm opposed to HP 464 and um
 
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
many of my reasons also apply to HB 367
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
and I thought I'd spare you having to
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
hear me twice so
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
um many of my comments aren't
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
specifically about the exceptions that
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
HB 464 is wanting to add
 
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
or the specific categories but about the
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
whole idea of expanding the program at
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:38:57.839 --> 00:38:58.670 align:start position:0%
this point
um

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm wondering what is the
 
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:04.220 align:start position:0%
justification for expanding the program
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
my when uh earlier this year the
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
um said quote it's exciting and
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
encouraging to know that New Hampshire
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
families now have the opportunity to
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
determine the best educational Pathways
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
for their children he was referring to
 
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.140 align:start position:0%
the new numbers that had just come out
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
from the EFA program yet so he stressed
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
that they now have a new opportunity to
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
determine best educational Pathways but
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
over the first two years of the program
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
only 694 students
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
who were in public school left public
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
school for this program 86 or 87 percent
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
of the students who took efas were
 
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
already in private or home school
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
without these public without needing
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
public subsidies so really we spent uh
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
22.8 million dollars to give 694
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
Children Choice the other people already
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
had Choice they'd already exercised
 
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
had Choice they'd already exercised
choice

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.730 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:09.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
also I feel like this is pretty early to
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
be expanding a program that's only been
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
in existence for a year and a half
 
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
in existence for a year and a half
um

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions that are
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
hard to answer this hasn't been a lot of
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
transparency about many different
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
aspects of the program I'll for instance
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know why those 694 students
 
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
did leave public school what was their
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
reason and how are they doing now have
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
their issues been addressed
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
what kind of academic progress has been
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
made by all of the EFA students over the
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
last year and a half
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the Bill's sponsors want to get this
 
00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:51.619 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors want to give EFA students
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
they want to give efas to so-called
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
students at so-called low performing
 
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.770 align:start position:0%
students at so-called low performing
schools

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
without regard to income but before they
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
do that shouldn't they determine whether
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
the private schools that might educate
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
these kids are better performing how do
 
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
we know what data do we have on that I'm
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
not aware of any
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
it's a scholarship organization making
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate determinations as to which
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
expenses to reimburse
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
has anybody else looked at that it's
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
those are very difficult decisions to
 
00:41:22.859 --> 00:41:23.710 align:start position:0%
those are very difficult decisions to
make

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
and I know that when the does rules
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
about this were in front of the Del car
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
committee the attorneys there felt that
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
that was an awful lot of perhaps
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
unlawful level of discussion to
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
um the scholarship organization is paid
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
10 up to 10 of every uh every uh expense
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
that it approves
 
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
I have I I don't want to sound like I'm
 
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:54.500 align:start position:0%
suggesting that anybody's doing anything
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh nefarious but somebody needs to be
 
00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
watching that other than the scholarship
 
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
organization itself it's public money
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's 21 22.8 million dollars so far and
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has said that uh it's
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
likely to double next year
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
is um is it scholarship organization
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
calculating its fees correctly what
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
safeguards are in place to prevent fraud
 
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
by parents I imagine there are some but
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
are they sufficient who knows have we
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
has anybody assessed that
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
why have only six percent of the efa's
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
gone to students with disabilities when
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
18 of the students in our state have
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
disability our special needs students
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
why has the fa money gone so
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
disproportionate lead to to religious
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
schools rather than secular schools
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
have any EFA students given up their
 
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.250 align:start position:0%
have any EFA students given up their
efas

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
efas
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
um can we turn to public school and if
 
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
so why
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
have any EFA students been denied
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
admission to any private schools and if
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
so on what basis
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
and then even expelled from private
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
schools and if so why
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
these are just some questions that
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
rattle off when you think about a
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
program this big and you wonder who's
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
watching it well the legislative
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
eversight committee was appointed to
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
watch it they were supposed to monitor
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
implementation and report back they met
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
once to organize they met a second time
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
last March and as far as the public
 
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
record shows they haven't met since the
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
statute required them to file a report
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
by last November but they didn't
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
and the only as far as I know the only
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
other oversight that's expected is an
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
LBA report they were supposed to be
 
00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:33.980 align:start position:0%
doing an audit next sometime after next
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh October I believe it hasn't happened
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
yet nobody's thought that as I
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
understand the legislature didn't think
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
it should happen earlier because there
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough data and there won't be
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
enough data until the program's been
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
operating for a while it hasn't happened
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
yet why would you expand a program this
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
big in any way whether by adding
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
categories by changing the income level
 
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
eligibility without first having
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
somebody outside the program actually
 
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
assess how it's doing whether it's
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
actually doing a good job or whether
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
whether the students in it are doing
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
better because they're in it whether
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
they're doing worse we need to know the
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
answers to these questions before a
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
program like this should be expanded
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cass Cannon thank you Mr
 
00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:19.730 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cass Cannon thank you Mr
chair

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you Miss well for your
 
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
um thank you Miss well for your
testimony

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:23.809 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.099 align:start position:0%
in listening to all of this I guess my
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
question would be and I don't know if
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
you know where this data would be
 
00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.230 align:start position:0%
you know where this data would be
available

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
but I know that all students in a
 
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
district have options to take a class
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
take a course get into a CT program join
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
a club join a athletic team within the
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
public school system which is locally
 
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
public school system which is locally
governed

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
governed
 
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.450 align:start position:0%
governed
um

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
but I just wonder if that data is
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
available because that is funded locally
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and an example is when I was a
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
teacher in a middle school Catholic
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
School my husband was a public school
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
science teacher and my students in
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
seventh eighth grade walked over to the
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
public school for science because
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
Catholic school did not offer science
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I would just be curious as to how
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
many students are access accessing
 
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
anything that the Public School District
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
offers because in my 50 years experience
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
that is what happens kids like to be on
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
athletic teams you want kids to be
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
social parents have always had school
 
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.329 align:start position:0%
social parents have always had school
choice

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a great thing I think
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
they should have it
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
but those services that are offered in
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
the public sector are offered to all
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
students and I wonder if you know where
 
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
that data might be
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
that shows students on scholarships and
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
how many public
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
or city-wide or district-wide services
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
do they access even if it's just one
 
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
class or one program or one team you
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
know if that's available students who
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
are taking afas yeah and I I really
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it's available or not
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
I just know that that it feels to me
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
like a lot of information is not
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
available and it may be available if
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
somebody would go out and collect it but
 
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know I you know I would I had a
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
few questions here and there about other
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
data about the schools and I contacted
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and they
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
said oh ask this you know as a
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization and I've sent
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
some emails to scholarship organization
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
have gotten nothing back I don't know
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
where you get the information I would
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
think it would be public and right but
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
um but I I really don't know and maybe
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
it is public and I just don't know I
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
don't want to sound like I'm no expert
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
I just don't that would be a good thing
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
it would be a good thing and and I agree
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
that parents have already have Choice
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
um you know 694 students took this
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
50 000 were eligible
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
parents are choosing they're making
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
choices they're choosing public school
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
by and large thank you are there
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative I just want
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
to thank you for taking my question good
 
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
morning good morning
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
um you made a comment I just want some
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
clarification you said something about
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
their 694
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
which is about 13 of those who and you
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
said they're the only ones
 
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.290 align:start position:0%
said they're the only ones
um

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:14.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
exercising Choice the ones that are
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
going from public to private so the
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
other 87 percent are staying
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
but are they not exercising Choice
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes a choice can be to stay where
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
they are which is what this is allowing
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
some struggling families to do
 
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
no I agree that they were that those
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
parents are exercising choice I was
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
referring to the commissioner's comment
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
that now that we have this EFA program
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh families now have the opportunity to
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
to determine the best Pathways for their
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
children well those 87 percent had
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
already made that choice before we had
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
an EFA program so how did the AF Pro AFA
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
program give them the choice they had it
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
already they had already exercised the
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
choice and they didn't need public
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
subsidy to do it apparently that that's
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
what I was referring to thank you
 
00:48:09.849 --> 00:48:09.859 align:start position:0%
further questions representative luno
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
very much Ms Wilke for joining us this
 
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.930 align:start position:0%
very much Ms Wilke for joining us this
morning

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
um it's been referred a couple times uh
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
during testimony this morning that that
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has made several
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
comments one of the comments he made
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
during a close-up uh this past weekend
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh was with respect to um uh fraud in
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
the EFA program and and the commissioner
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
said that he's reviewed certain
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
materials and is assured that there's no
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
fraud in the program as has been seen in
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
other states and I was wondering if
 
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:47.180 align:start position:0%
you've had an opportunity to also review
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
the materials that the commissioner is
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
materials he is referring to I noticed
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
in the rules for instance that if
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
parents get are used the efas to get
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
computers and other technology and
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
internet service they can't it has to be
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
used 51 of the time
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
for Education the educational
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
needs of their child
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how that's been
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
monitored I don't know if the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner has gone into homes in fact
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know where's where's the
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
information to find it if that's
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
actually happened I want to really get
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
us back to the nature of this bill when
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the EFA and fraud
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with the
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
additional categories which we're
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
alluding to in this bill so let's keep
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
the questioning
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
On Target here please
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up a follow-up please
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you um is there anything in the um
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill here
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
um which which obviously is an amendment
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
of the um EFA statute 194 F1 uh that
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
would um uh um make you feel that um
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
that that unlike in other states New
 
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has better protection against
 
00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has better protection against
fraud

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I really I'm not really
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
sure what you're asking could you say
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
anything so so give given the fact that
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner said that there
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
has been fraud in other states and that
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's none in New Hampshire is there
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
anything specific to this bill or this
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
or the statute in New Hampshire that
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
would lead you to believe that yeah
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
there's um there's something different
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire nothing anything
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
I've learned about uh other states
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
implementation of these programs
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
compared to New Hampshire so I haven't
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
seen anything like that okay thank you
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
 
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.530 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
um we just heard testimony that alluded
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
to possible discrimination and EFA
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
funding against disabled students noting
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
that while 18 of New Hampshire students
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
have a disability only six percent of
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
EFA funding has gone to disabled
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
students but this bill on page 2 line 12
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
would appear to be designed specifically
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
to remedy that by opening efas to all
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
disabled students can can you speak at
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
all to the that apparent dissonance
 
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.770 align:start position:0%
all to the that apparent dissonance
there

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
well I I would think that uh parents of
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
students with special needs are probably
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
spread I don't know if they're spread
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
evenly throughout the income levels I
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
doubt that they're mostly wealthy
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and so I would assume that if you if
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
you're at 300 or below eligibility
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
um it would still be that among that
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
group there are still 18 of students who
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
are have disabilities and yet the
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
program has only been serving six
 
00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:50.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
do you have any Source relating to that
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
below 300 income threshold also has the
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
same no I don't I just the only
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
information I have is with that
 
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide how many thank you thank you
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Tanner
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here testifying
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
um with disabilities uh the private
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
schools and the non-public Schools are
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
they required to follow Ida for example
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
if a child needed a wheelchair or an
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
elevator uh for that particular building
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
or special services are they required to
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
provide those that's my understanding
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
that they're not that parents give up
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
the right to um in to have an IEP all
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
the services that would be in an IEP
 
00:52:37.559 --> 00:52:39.109 align:start position:0%
the services that would be in an IEP
provided

00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you Mr
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
chairman I am the director of latitude
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
learning resources which is a homeschool
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
Learning Center a non-profit Center in
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
Derry New Hampshire our students are
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and we have approximately
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
20 percent of our families that use the
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
EFA program or a scholarship of some
 
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
sort to take part in our programming
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
among all of our students on a typical
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
day we have up to 40 percent who have
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of a neurodivergent learning
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
or a disorder like anxiety or trauma
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
so we see quite a lot of students who
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
are not neurotypical or do not have I
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
guess typical family experiences or
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
typical learning experiences
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
in a given week we offer about 70
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
classes our ages are 4 to 18 for our
 
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.010 align:start position:0%
classes our ages are 4 to 18 for our
students

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
for this bill there are two
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
classifications of that would expand
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
offerings to the type of students that
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
the first is for disability and as I
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have up to 40 percent of
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
our students on a given day who would
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
fall into that category
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
so the other one is because of bullying
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
we have quite a number of students who
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
have left public schools because of
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
fitting in
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we even have had bullying from
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
reported from
 
00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:24.059 align:start position:0%
teachers or administrators amongst our
 
00:54:24.059 --> 00:54:26.450 align:start position:0%
teachers or administrators amongst our
families

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to tell you about two of my
 
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
students one his name is John I'm going
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
to call him John that's not his actual
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
name he came to us and
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
he had been in an auto accident when he
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
was a boy a young child
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
he was put in this public school sent to
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
a special classroom and he was punished
 
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.370 align:start position:0%
a special classroom and he was punished
for

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
symptoms of his accident that resulted
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
from his accident he came to us two
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
years ago and can only participate for
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
part of a day
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
at that point he was a full home
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
schooler over the course of two years in
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
our program he was able to improve to
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
the point where he was assisting
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
teachers with their classes
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
another student
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
is on the opt excuse me the autism
 
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.309 align:start position:0%
is on the opt excuse me the autism
spectrum

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
she her parents went to her local public
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
school to try to get her special
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
services in an IEP she was denied at our
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
program because we're small and Nimble
 
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
we were able to take care of her needs
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
so our program has met the needs of a
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
lot of the students who were
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
I guess in consideration for this bill
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to thank you for your time
 
00:55:37.569 --> 00:55:37.579 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:40.460 align:start position:0%
yes reps in woodcock
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
just one here um just some clarity here
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
on your home School Association right
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
because you said your chairman of The
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
Homeschool Association there's
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that the students come
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
to you so is there a structure or brick
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
and mortar structure where they go yes
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
we have a facility in Dairy okay so it's
 
00:55:59.819 --> 00:56:00.770 align:start position:0%
we have a facility in Dairy okay so it's
a

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
another home school it's a private
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
school it's not a school we cannot call
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
ourselves a school according to State
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
regulation we're a Learning Center okay
 
00:56:09.059 --> 00:56:10.490 align:start position:0%
regulation we're a Learning Center okay
food

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
you're just a place where people come
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
exactly so to explain our program just
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
for clarification families sign up for
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
one to four days per week for their
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
students to attend classes for a full
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
day the students choose four classes per
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
day and because they are homeschoolers
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
their parents are in charge of their
 
00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
learning program they just come to us to
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
as a supplement for their homeschool
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
learning thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other further
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Hall
 
00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned that
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
20 use efa's currently with this bill
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
how would you see that changing
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
I am not sure how it would change
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
because we are at capacity for our
 
00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.190 align:start position:0%
because we are at capacity for our
program

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
I'm imagining that other programs like
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
latitude learning would emerge if there
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
are more more students in need
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you further
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative cascadden
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for all
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
the work that you do to submit and
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
provide support to those individual
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
students my question is and you
 
00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:18.890 align:start position:0%
students my question is and you
mentioned

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
um bullying is prevalent and as you know
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes a problem in a lot of
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
places uh but based on that
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
is your Learning Center required to
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
complete a school safety data report
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
that other schools have to submit to the
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
state it talks about safety of students
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%

not a school so we do not have to so as
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
a learning center or an EFA
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
no efas are individual correct they are
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
individual yeah but we are an approved
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.150 align:start position:0%
vendor for the EFA program okay thank
you

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:54.780 align:start position:0%

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:04.910 align:start position:0%
um about
um

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
non-public schools and discrimination
 
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
um specifically I think uh in relation
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
to children with special needs
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
um does your Learning Center
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
discriminate in any way
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely not we do our best to
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
accommodate the needs of families when
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
they come to us thank you thank you
 
00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
representative you had your hand up yeah
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair do um do
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
you collect data on bullying and other
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
um um student uh discipline issues
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
So within our Center we have our own
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
metrics that we use we do our own
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
reporting but we are not required to
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
submit our reporting to any state agency
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
as we are not a school yes well is it
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
possible to share that reporting with
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to speak with you on an
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
individual basis but I do not want to
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
reveal any data from our families as
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
their active families and we have a very
 
00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:06.619 align:start position:0%
small Center so I don't want to
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
discriminate against those families
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Balboni
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just curious when
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
you say that you have the opportunity
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
for them to come one to four days how
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
many students would be in your facility
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
at one time and how many students do you
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
serve as a whole thank you for the
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
question so we have over 100 students
 
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
come during the week and at a on any
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
given day we have a between 40 and 60
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
students so some students come for one
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
day a week some come for four days a
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
week it's totally dependent on what the
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
family is willing and wanting to do
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
so yes just a quick follow-up um so when
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
you have those 40 students in the center
 
00:59:58.569 --> 00:59:58.579 align:start position:0%
at one time what is your ratio of a
 
01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
instructor or parent to student at that
 
01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:02.930 align:start position:0%
instructor or parent to student at that
time

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
it varies depending on the age of the
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
kid but
 
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do a quick calculation in
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
my head our largest class is 20 students
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
and we have two teachers in that class
 
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
plus we have backup teachers and staff
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
who are able to help out some of our
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
question as an approved EFA vendor do
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
all of the staff at your school have
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
criminal checks done before they work
 
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.730 align:start position:0%
criminal checks done before they work
there

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
so we background check anyone who is not
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
a parent we
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
parents who teach are generally known
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
entities with us who have been with us
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
for a long time who are part of our
 
01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:54.299 align:start position:0%
original group but anybody who comes
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
from the outside absolutely they go
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
through a background check
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up parents who are teaching in
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
your school do not have a background
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
check but they are teaching in your
 
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.490 align:start position:0%
check but they are teaching in your
school

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
yes with their kids there at the same
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Belcher
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair just to
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
clarify your your program is not so much
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
a school in a traditional sense as it is
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
a a center where parents can bring their
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
children to homeschool them collectively
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
an environment that becomes more
 
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
efficient is that is that sort of a
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
correctly about it
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
you could say it's efficiency but I
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the reason why most
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
parents come I think it they want their
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
children there for social opportunities
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
for learning in areas that the kids
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
might have an interest that they're not
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
capable of teaching at home or because
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
some kids prefer social opportunities or
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
social learning
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
so efficiency does come into it but
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's not the primary motivation
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
Ellison oh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you mentioned
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
that you do do background checks is this
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
the same process that the public school
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
uses to background check teachers and if
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
not what what is the process for
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
background checking somebody in your
 
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
school I am not familiar with what the
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
public schools use but we use a National
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
Organization to do our background check
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
so it's a a state and National Check
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
well yes uh could you provide the
 
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
committee with some information on that
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
organization that's involved in doing
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
background checks I yes the name of the
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
organization just changed and I can't
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
remember the new name but after I'm more
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
than happy to thank you other further
 
01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.710 align:start position:0%
than happy to thank you other further
questions

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you very much thank you
 
01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:46.940 align:start position:0%

have a good day
Wendy

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
Wendy
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
um just introduction my name is Wendy
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
Santiago I am a mother of one child I am
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
a graduate student of clinical Mental
 
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.049 align:start position:0%
a graduate student of clinical Mental
Health

01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:19.069 align:start position:0%
Health
um

01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
so finding school for my son has always
 
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:25.220 align:start position:0%
been difficult because instead of being
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
on an artistic Spectrum he's on a gifted
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
spectrum and he's very gifted
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
um I say finding a school for him was
 
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
very difficult because unfortunately New
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't offer an accelerated
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
programs for children that are
 
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.910 align:start position:0%
programs for children that are
accelerated

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
accelerated
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
so I I did homeschool him for quite a
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
little for up to third grade
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
I did choose to send them to a public
 
01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:52.460 align:start position:0%
school here in New Hampshire
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
mainly for social skills and for other
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
skills that you know I thought would be
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
necessary for him
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
during that time in that in that school
 
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
he entered at third grade
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
after being called to the office saying
 
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
that we're having educational issues
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
with your child because you just
 
01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
completed almost two months worth of
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
work in a week because he's accelerated
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
he was put in a fifth grade classroom
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
he was doing absolutely wonderful
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
until mid-school where he became bullied
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
physically abused
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the point we had to go to the
 
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
to the point we had to go to the
hospital

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
he couldn't walk for a little bit
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
emotionally scarred
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
concerned that the threats of one child
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
the Brenda gone
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
was very real to him
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
it was to the point where I had to make
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
an escape plan for him that he ever felt
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
scared that he had every right to go
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
over to Casa which was located on the
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:02.990 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.030 align:start position:0%
foreign
concerns

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
and the non-responsive of the school
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
staff whether they they tried or not it
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
didn't solve the issue I had to pull him
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
from that school
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
I didn't know where to bring my son
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
except to re-home School him at home
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
which I did
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that is when I found out about
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund prior the
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
EFA where now he successfully at a
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
um his testing scores have skyrocketed
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
he's in eighth grade currently but since
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
his third grade and currently
 
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
um where he's at he's been able to
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
succeed the school has a zero bullying
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
tolerance the school has suspended
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
students for bullying there it does it
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't you're just suspended it doesn't
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
happen in this school it's not tolerated
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
when I say that his testing scores have
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
rocketed his knee while testing as well
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
as his Iowa testing both suggest the
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
same he is at a 10th plus grade level 13
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
plus and multiple of those levels he is
 
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:16.609 align:start position:0%
plus and multiple of those levels he is
above

01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
above
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
um he's an eighth and a half ninth grade
 
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
math level which is all above his level
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
he was he had the opportunity to go to
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
high school this year if he wanted to
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
um but I allowed him to make his own
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
educational choice and he chose to stay
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
at the school that he's at and I think
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's important to understand that
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
bullying has a huge aspect
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
on how children learn
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about vulnerable
 
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.549 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about vulnerable
children

01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
that come from
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
backgrounds that we have in this house
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.450 align:start position:0%
backgrounds that we have in this house
bill

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
it only makes it very difficult for
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
those children to learn
 
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
or be accepted
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's hard when a child comes home
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
and has significant bursitis and a need
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
because a child decides to throw him to
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
ripping his clothes
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
embarrassing him taunting him
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
harassing him choosing him out to harass
 
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.849 align:start position:0%
harassing him choosing him out to harass
him

01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
I mean we have state laws that are
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
against that and if I recall correctly
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
it's RSA
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
466 that talks about harassment
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when I go and I ask for
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
help under that law for my child somehow
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
he's exempt from that
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
when I go to the school it's somehow
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay for this to be happening
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
so without the help from EFA and without
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
the help from children's scholarship
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
fund my son would continue to be at home
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
and not being able to accelerate to who
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
he is today and I'm very proud to say
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
because of the less stress that he has
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
at school not only can he focus on his
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
current schoolwork but he's also
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
currently a student pilot
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
and he's very proud of that and he's can
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
only give thanks to
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
all the yeses that you've given
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
positively to these programs and I ask
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
that you continue to say yes to help
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
other students
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
to move forward and out of these abusive
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
situations and into in a situation that
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
they can learn and Excel these are our
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
children's next this is our next future
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
these are people who are going to be
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
sitting in your chairs making decisions
 
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I think it's going to be very
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
difficult for children to rise up and
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
work or go into any other field after
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
school if they're continued to sit in a
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
situation of abuse and neglect from our
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
school districts in regards to bullying
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying all do but this
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
particular School my son went to was
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you very much Wendy I
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate it are there questions yes
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chairman
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony it's
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
very moving and so are you saying that
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this bill it will
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
increase the physical safety of our
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
students because it allows them to have
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
that choice to if they are bullied which
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
is one of the categories a spill would
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
expand to they have the opportunity to
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
be in a safer environment
 
01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.259 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that bullying is not
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
prejudiced against certain income levels
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
all income levels
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
have children in that have been bullied
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
and I feel that if we can raise this to
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
a higher income level that then those
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
other children that right now are not in
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
that income level can have that same
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity of having a safe education
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you further
 
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.570 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you further
questions

01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
now see thank you very much for your
 
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.270 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
best uh not to embarrass the
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
organization as I said at this table
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%

you can be to yourselves I just want to
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
hit a couple points uh that we think are
 
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.130 align:start position:0%
hit a couple points uh that we think are
important

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
while looking at voucher EFA programs
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
whichever one we want to call them and
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
looking at outcomes which uh someone who
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
spoke at this table before talked about
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
not knowing the outcomes in this state
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
of how these students are doing once
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
they take the fa there have been studies
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
that have been done that talk about
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes for students who take vouchers
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
throughout the country so I'm going to
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
highlight just a few of them here
 
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
in 2008 the Federal Reserve Bank of
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
Chicago so that's the best research to
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
date finds relatively small achievement
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
gains for voucher students most of which
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
are not statistically different than
 
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.470 align:start position:0%

low-income students who switched from

public to private school using a voucher

um

01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative Iowa introduced this Bill
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
said something that we actually agree on
 
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.270 align:start position:0%
said something that we actually agree on
together

01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.169 align:start position:0%
together
um

01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is that our schools I came here
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
she said uh she referred to my cash
 
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
maybe not cash strap but that was the
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
sort of the point of the what that she
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
was making
 
01:12:26.699 --> 01:12:27.229 align:start position:0%
was making
um

01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
we should be funding our Public Schools
 
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
public dollars should be funding our
 
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:32.060 align:start position:0%
Public Schools so that students who have
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh IEPs or other problems or and I'm a
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
father of four uh with a uh my second
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
child who is neurodivergent I understand
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
that this is a real thing
 
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.470 align:start position:0%
that this is a real thing
um

01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
should be funding them so that they can
 
01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
work with all students that's what
 
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
public schools are set for and these
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that they already do
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
better than the voucher counterparts
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
when given Voucher Program money so
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's really the Highlight they wanted
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
to do here
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave it at that because she did
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
say more again you can read her letter
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
um but I hope you take any questions
 
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:09.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question did I hear you
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
correctly that you said the 2008 study
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
was the best research to date and do we
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
have will we get information on these
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
studies I think and if not I will have
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
her attached I think in her email she
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
sends you attached to all the studies to
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
the to the testimony all right so the
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
first part of my question was did you
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
see the 2008 that was one question in
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
2008 they said their best research to
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
date so and then there were more studies
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
that happened later than that okay thank
 
01:13:42.239 --> 01:13:43.669 align:start position:0%
that happened later than that okay thank
you

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
chair you provided some um evidence from
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
outside of State based on uh outcomes uh
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
looking at the the academic differences
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
between public school students versus
 
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
voucher or private school students
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
but are there also not other measures of
 
01:14:05.209 --> 01:14:05.219 align:start position:0%
outcome besides solely looking at
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
standardized academic testing and
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
further who is in a better position to
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
judge those outcomes is it is it us
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
sitting here in a room in Concord or is
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
it parents
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
well I mean I think you know as a parent
 
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
you're you hopefully sitting down with
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
your kid and talking to them and seeing
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
what they're learning every day and you
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
know experiencing that with them I think
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
that's really important
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not going to sit here and say
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
the standardized tests are the best way
 
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
to judge academics but they are way too
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
judge academics and I think
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
um we can certainly use we should use
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
all the tools that we have and that's
 
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
Michael thank you very much thank you so
 
01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.250 align:start position:0%
Michael thank you very much thank you so
much

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
good morning sir
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
good morning and uh thank you Mr
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to provide testimony
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
here today my name is Sarah Scott and
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of Grassroots
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
operations with Americans for Prosperity
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and on behalf of
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
and our activists all across the state
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh we ask that you support House Bill
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
464 to expand eligibility for the
 
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts program I
 
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat too much of the
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
testimony that's already been given here
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
today but since the education Freedom
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
accounts program was launched in 2021
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
we've seen over 3 000 students who have
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of that this opportunity
 
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
to really find an education that best
 
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
fits them
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this opportunity doesn't
 
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:47.780 align:start position:0%
exist still for thousands of students
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
across the state and this could really
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
be a life-changing opportunity for some
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
of these specific at-risk categories of
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
students like those in foster care
 
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
English language Learners the bullied
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
students children of military families
 
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
and uh these categories are already
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations and we should
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
really be giving them every opportunity
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
we can to succeed in kind of looking at
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill I did some research on some
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
other states that have passed similar
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
programs a lot of other states have
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
specifically outlined these categories
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
as eligible for Education Freedom
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
accounts so I looked at kind of some of
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
the reasons that these parents have have
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
opted for this and in I think the state
 
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
was Arizona they were one of the first
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
states to offer it to be a specific
 
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
categories and specifically looking at
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
some of the students with disabilities
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
and one of the stories that I was
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
reading was actually a parent who was
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
explaining that her child was getting
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
greater services with their local public
 
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
school they enjoyed the the teachers
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
they liked the program the only issue
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
they had was that her child's Peak
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
learning hours were from 6 a.m to 9 A.M
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
it seems like a very small window just
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
meant you know most kids are going to be
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
in school from eight o'clock onwards but
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
her student learned best from six to
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
nine and unfortunately the public school
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't accommodate that we can't
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
always open the school for just one
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
child at that early hour so she was
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
looking to take an EFA specifically for
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
that case so I think a lot of times we
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
think that if a student is taking an EFA
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
they must have an issue with the current
 
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
Public School sometimes that issue might
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
just be timing and I think there are a
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
lot of instances like this that we can't
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
really accommodate for every child so we
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
need to be making sure that we're giving
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for these families to
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
find the option that does work for them
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
so I know this is a just a couple of
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
very specific categories but I think
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's really important to give these
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
students the option to find an education
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
that best fits them and make sure that
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
we're not in in Concord here saying that
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits-all system is what works
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
but really giving it to the parents and
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
the students to decide what works best
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
so I know you guys are running a little
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
long here so I'll just wrap it up by
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
saying that uh we ask that you support
 
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir are there any
 
01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.530 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir are there any
questions

01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
not seeing the hands thank you very much
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
good morning Brian good morning thank
 
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
you for hearing my testimony my name is
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins I'm here represent
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
representing Nea New Hampshire today and
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
um like Mr O'Brien I'll be handing in a
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
letter from our president Megan uh so
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
that you'll uh but I'll just speak into
 
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
that and summarize that we're here in
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 464 and later
 
01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
on uh the subsequent bill because this
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
would greatly increase the amount of
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
funds directed toward our school voucher
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
program by expanding the eligibility of
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
the program and the P the bill appears
 
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
to do so by eliminating the income
 
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
eligibility from among a variety of
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
categories of students so a few
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
overarching uh concerns about expanding
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
the program generally first
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
we believe that school vouchers
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
undermine the state's commitment to
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
public education by diverting scarce
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
resources as was referenced in earlier
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
testimony away from our community
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
schools these are the ones that we all
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
invest in the ones that serve the vast
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
majority of our students
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
and whose funding model is one that we
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
still have to fix though we still have
 
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
to work on that and we feel that that
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
ought to be the priority for the
 
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
legislature first before we are
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
expanding a program that we're still
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
unsure of what expanding that program
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
means both for student outcomes and for
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
the costs of the state
 
01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.330 align:start position:0%
the costs of the state
um

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:52.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh as was mentioned earlier
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um there have been a number of recent
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
studies that uh private school doctors
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
do not improve academic achievement and
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
we have no indication of that here in
 
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we I have I have not
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
seen any studies about the program here
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
only the ones that were referenced in in
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
other states and uh when I hand in the
 
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
testimony we have citations for all of
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
those studies uh that you can that so
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
that you can look at it they include
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
studies from Louisiana Indiana Ohio
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
which I demonstrated that those
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
experiences actually produce worse
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
academic outcomes from their peers so
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that New Hampshire has
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
that but uh we ought to be looking at
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
that before we go go ahead and expand
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
this program also some other studies
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
from longer standing programs like the
 
01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:53.780 align:start position:0%
district Colombia
 
01:20:58.570 --> 01:20:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
these this the pro the EFA the EFA
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
program that we have does not hold to
 
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
the high uh accountability and standards
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools do we have rigorous
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
academic standards which we've been
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
talking about in other committees and
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
those standards are carried out and and
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
held to account by locally elected
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
School boards
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
um not not the case with the program
 
01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about expanding today
 
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
um and specifically to the to the point
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
about the expanded groups uh you know
 
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
our concern is that they are not going
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
to receive the necessary services that
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
um they would otherwise receive
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
um in in our Public Schools uh you know
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
some of our small rural uh property poor
 
01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.790 align:start position:0%
some of our small rural uh property poor
communities

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
um these schools rely very heavily on
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
state funding and we have not adopted a
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
separate Revenue source for this program
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and we are committing more money to
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
it with this bill and and the subsequent
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
bill that you'll hear later on this
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
morning so uh
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
many of us who whether you support or
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
oppose efas agree we need to do more for
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
districts like like these
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and that we're not diverting precious
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
funds away from the schools schools that
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
need it most
 
01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.610 align:start position:0%
need it most
um

01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
just a couple of quick references from
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
some earlier uh and and again this this
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
is in our written testimony so I won't
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
read it I won't read it but the the
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
current EFA program does require
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities to sign away
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh their idea rights and so that that's
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
in the law uh there uh there's also uh
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh you know bullying
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
that our law only applies to public
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
schools and so
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
um that there aren't not remedies
 
01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
for families under under a private
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
school setting
 
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.290 align:start position:0%
school setting
um

01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then I think I'll just close with
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
One Financial note I know we're in the
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
policy committee so
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
um you know the department put forward
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is the as RN our understanding is
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
that this is the proposal that the
 
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:21.500 align:start position:0%
department has put forward I believe
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is what they brought to the
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
governor's budget request
 
01:23:28.689 --> 01:23:28.699 align:start position:0%
uh hearings and so
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh and in those requests
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
um you have a program that has gone from
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
estimated being just several hundred
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in in in in in in the
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
first uh year to now a request of over
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
30 or nearly 30 million a year and so I
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's unclear I don't know whether the
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
department will be testifying but one
 
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:53.900 align:start position:0%
question I think the committee ought to
 
01:23:57.770 --> 01:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh ask of the department is are those
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
requests uh
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
accommodating the policy proposals in
 
01:24:04.729 --> 01:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
or are they just to maintain the current
 
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
projections they have under the law as
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
it is I think that's an important
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
um item for the legislature to
 
01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.950 align:start position:0%
um item for the legislature to
understand

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
well I have further comments about 367
 
01:24:23.699 --> 01:24:25.250 align:start position:0%
well I have further comments about 367
but

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll leave those to my to my
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony I'll close there thank
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
you represent Cordell you have a
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hawkins for being here
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned diverting money from
 
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
public schools can you identify any
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
public schools that have not gotten the
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
money that were promised to them
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
according to state law sure uh maybe I
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
should clarify so when when I say
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
diverted money uh I think we've heard a
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
lot about a lot of needs that our
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
schools have not only at the hearing
 
01:24:59.630 --> 01:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
today but I think in every hearing you
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
have in this committee and so we feel
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
that it would be important to
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
direct those public resources to those
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
needs first before we are expanding a
 
01:25:12.179 --> 01:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
needs first before we are expanding a
program

01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
um like this so I hope that clarifies
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
some follow-up questions yes thank you
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
so really you're not talking about
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
diverting money you're talking about the
 
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
need for a new education funding formula
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
is that am I correct I guess diverting
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
in the sense that you know our education
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
trust fund was was meant to so to uh
 
01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.070 align:start position:0%
trust fund was was meant to so to uh
support

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
um a public school
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh our public schools and
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
with the law the way it's structured
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
right now uh that also that is also
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
supporting the EFA program
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
um without any additional Revenue
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
sources and so
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so that that is what I'm referring to
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
when I when I'm saying that the
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
resources and funds are being diverted
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question represent
 
01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.810 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question represent
Tanner

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
Tanner
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
question do you know any school public
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire who's not fully
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
funded in special education at this
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
point because of the funding
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh I hear this is an issue that uh
 
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
we I think we hear it quite frequently
 
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
that special special education costs uh
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
whether it is from federal government or
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
the state government is not uh you know
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
the support could be much greater uh in
 
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
order to to to
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
um to carry out the mission
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative like us
 
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding from thank you for
 
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question that from various
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard that part of
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
the issue with um
 
01:26:59.450 --> 01:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
special needs and providers is that
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
there just aren't enough and that
 
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
schools even though they may have the
 
01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
funds are not finding the providers and
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering how
 
01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.209 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering how
um

01:27:10.209 --> 01:27:10.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
disallowing students or parents to try
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
to find those
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
providers on their own which maybe they
 
01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
have to drive two and a half hours to
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
how that is harming the public schools
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
who can't take their kids maybe two and
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
a half hours
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for the question I think
 
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
that goes to the the point about the uh
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
we we
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
the state could be doing uh a far more
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
significant sorry I'm I'm also looking
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
past the speaker here uh
 
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
in uh in terms of uh so supporting our
 
01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.010 align:start position:0%
in uh in terms of uh so supporting our
schools

01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
um overall I mean one of the we we've
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the Staffing
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
shortages in schools and that's
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
significant whether it's you know
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
teachers to paraprofessionals uh some of
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
the uh folks are really key to carrying
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
out uh IEP programs
 
01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:09.590 align:start position:0%
out uh IEP programs
um

01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
we it is hard it is harder to uh and one
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the keys to that I think in finding
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
the limited amount of staff we have is
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
having additional programs that not only
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
help feed the pipeline of people who can
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
take those roles but also uh additional
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
funds so that schools have greater
 
01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
flexibility in increasing their wages
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
and I think I think that's where we
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking at rather than
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you know an additional
 
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh 30 million dollars a year out of the
 
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
trust fund to to
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
um to fund uh the program we're talking
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
about today you're welcome and one last
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
question represent Belcher thank you Mr
 
01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:55.430 align:start position:0%
question represent Belcher thank you Mr
chair

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
um just to try to get the heart of the
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
issue a little bit in speaking to the
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
the concern about public funds being
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
directed to
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
um perhaps non-public education
 
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
um obviously we live in a Multicultural
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
Society and I guess my question is
 
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
should we be looking to
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
um to allow one part of that culture
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps a politically dominant part of
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
that culture to have a monopoly on
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
public funds going to
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
them or should we be trying to meet the
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
needs of other all sort of multifaceted
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
cultural groups
 
01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
by allowing public funds to flow in ways
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.390 align:start position:0%
I think that
um

01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
I think that is important we meet the
 
01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
needs of our of our students that's
 
01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:48.860 align:start position:0%
obviously number one
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
and I think we and I think what we have
 
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
through some of the points I was making
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
earlier about funding I don't think
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
we've necessarily realized all of that
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
because we could be doing a better job
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
of of funding the community schools that
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
we have the ones that we all have a say
 
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
in whether we're parents or not parents
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know we have a say in what that
 
01:30:13.129 --> 01:30:13.139 align:start position:0%
curriculum looks like we have a say in
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
who are the elected officials that
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
manage that program
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and I you know that's I feel that
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's not the case with the program
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here especially
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
when we're using
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
um public dollars thank you very much we
 
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
have one more person to testify uh thank
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
you very much Brian thank you have a
 
01:30:32.169 --> 01:30:32.179 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
good morning uh to Mr chairman and
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and thank you
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
um I understand that there was my name
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
is Louise Spencer and I'm um co-founder
 
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:02.060 align:start position:0%
of the Kemp Street Coalition which is an
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
all-volunteer Grassroots organization
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I understand that there was testimony
 
01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.250 align:start position:0%
um I understand that there was testimony
today

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:09.260 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the teachers unions were had
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
organized a protest outside and I just
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify about that point
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
although it would make sense that
 
01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
teachers would be outside in support of
 
01:31:25.209 --> 01:31:25.219 align:start position:0%
public education
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
they're mostly in the classrooms today
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
so the folks standing outside were
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
primarily from the Kent Street Coalition
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
and just they're members of the
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
community who are concerned about our
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
public schools and making them the
 
01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
strongest can you speak to the bill
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
yes well I was just speaking we were
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
standing outside opposing the bell hb464
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
and its companion bill
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
um so and I also just wanted to speak to
 
01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
the testimony provided which was very
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
moving about a child being bullied in
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
the schools and that in support of the
 
01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:12.860 align:start position:0%
bill HB 464.
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
that should not have been anywhere at
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
any time in any school public or private
 
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
in our state and I would ask the
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee instead of diverting public
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
funds to private schools which in fact
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
this bill these bills do do that the
 
01:32:35.689 --> 01:32:35.699 align:start position:0%
attention would be better spent on
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of bullying and
 
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:40.940 align:start position:0%
solving that to make sure that no child
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
is ever in a position in the school
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
where they're thrown to the ground or
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
they're are not able to learn because
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
the school is an unsafe environment so
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
please take up that issue and spend the
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
time instead on that instead of making
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
it harder for our public schools to do
 
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
the job that they're there to do so
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for our
 
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
not saying thank you very much okay
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh there there's been no pink cards put
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
forward so I'm going to close this
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
hearing at this time we're going to take
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
a five minute break before we start up
 
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.860 --> 01:40:29.209 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay we're going ahead now with the next
 
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.260 align:start position:0%

01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
so how did this bill has come to be
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
it just came okay when we were working
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
on the efas I remember talking to so
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
many parents who were so excited that
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
finally they were going to have the
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
money the means to provide for their
 
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
kids the education that they felt that
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
they're you know that their kids weren't
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
currently getting and that that they
 
01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:33.550 align:start position:0%
currently getting and that that they
needed

01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
and they were very excited and then
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
when the EFA became finalized and the
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
300 cap was put on it which wasn't
 
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
originally in there it was originally
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
every child was supposed to be educating
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
every child as a previous speaker had
 
01:41:51.719 --> 01:41:53.629 align:start position:0%
every child as a previous speaker had
mentioned

01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:41:53.639 --> 01:41:56.090 align:start position:0%
mentioned
um

01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.649 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:57.659 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
money that the state provides is
 
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide education for every
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
child in the state
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
and so here you know so the idea in the
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
efas is it was to go to Every child in
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
the state and then the cap got put on
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
and there were parents who were very
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
disappointed to find they were just
 
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
above that cap and still and this is
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
what I heard this is sort of a
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
paraphrase of what I heard from lots of
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
different parents in their own words but
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
it was basically once again the
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
government takes and takes from us and
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't give anything back we're the
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
ones that always suffer and that's the
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
middle class they pay the most taxes of
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
anybody whether it's Federal whether
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's their property taxes whatever they
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
end up paying the most taxes total
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
and they're the ones that always get
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
left behind
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't make enough money there's
 
01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.330 align:start position:0%
don't make enough money there's
scholarships

01:42:59.330 --> 01:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's programs the individual schools
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
have scholarships there's scholarship
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
programs there's all kinds of things
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
available and If you have money you can
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
just pay for it
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
the people who get hurt all the time are
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
the middle class they pay they pay they
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
pay they support everybody else and when
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
it comes to them and their kids they
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
can't afford to send their kids to that
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
private school they can't afford to pay
 
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
for that special needs teacher who's the
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
they pay their taxes
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
there was one parent who said to me what
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
are my kids garbage she was very upset
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
she was listening to the testimony
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I think it was Senate testimony at
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
the time and the person was going on and
 
01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
on about our private school kid you know
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
our public school kids and she's like
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
my kids don't fit into the public school
 
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
what about them do they not count are
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
they not people are they not deserving
 
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
of an education too
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
I pay my taxes she said
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
why can't my kids have the same
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity of Education
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
just because they're not going to the
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
public school why are they being singled
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
out she was very upset
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
so I thought well let's at least I mean
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
as you know I have another bill to get
 
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
rid of the cap because I believe that
 
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
every child is entitled to that state
 
01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.709 align:start position:0%
every child is entitled to that state
money

01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
as according to the Supreme Court
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
however many years ago that was but I
 
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
thought at least at least let's reach
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
out to those Middle School I mean middle
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
income people who can't afford the
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
education and don't get the scholarships
 
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
so I was trying to figure out what is
 
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
that number and at first I was and I
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
asked various people from the state and
 
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
various other people what is that number
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
and at first I was told 600 percent and
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
then there was a deep dive into well
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
they thought 550 would probably reach
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
all the parents
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
middle-income parents who couldn't
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
afford to send their kids to school well
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
I was I know that people are all upset
 
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
about paying for middle-income people
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
and paying for non-public school people
 
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
and so I dropped it to 500 percent I was
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
being conservative compared to what I
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
was told it would actually you know who
 
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
to try to Encompass that middle income
 
01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
to try to Encompass that middle income
group

01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
of parents and students in our state so
 
01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:31.910 align:start position:0%
of parents and students in our state so
that's

01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's basically what this is about and
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'm open to questions thank you very
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
much are there questions for
 
01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.229 align:start position:0%
much are there questions for
representative

01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think we clarified
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
that the current 300 percent is around
 
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
eighty thousand dollars
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
500 would take that uh cap up to what
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
I don't remember exactly at the moment
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
because they're changing what that those
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
numbers are I had calculated at one
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
point it was like 111.
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
um but my understanding is the
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government is changing
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
numbers and whatever so I'm not sure
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
it's no I think I think it is published
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
yeah well I
 
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
I haven't done the current calculation
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
based on the code
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
I think and we we had the same bill last
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
year and I think when we were dealing
 
01:46:34.729 --> 01:46:34.739 align:start position:0%
with it last year I believe correct me
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but I believe it was about
 
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
a hundred moves it to about a hundred
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
and forty thousand dollars is that do
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
you remember that no I remember 111 no
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
but let me clarify for you please a
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
hundred and eleven thousand dollars for
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
400 percent of a family that was for 400
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
if you're going to a family of five
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
um if you do some really quick math and
 
01:46:58.729 --> 01:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to do it myself at 130
 
01:47:01.209 --> 01:47:01.219 align:start position:0%
137 000 roughly
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah okay yeah and my and my my
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
point to that is this is based on the
 
01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:11.420 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
which the area we live in is pretty
 
01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
expensive and the Southern Tier of our
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
state is very expensive and compared to
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
the South
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's like twice as much to live I I
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
know people who moved from here to there
 
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
and they're paying half as much now in
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
rent they buy you know the houses cost
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
half as much Etc so I'm saying that our
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
average cost of living here is a lot
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
higher and so going by the federal
 
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
poverty level
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
um that's a nationwide average and we
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
are at the near the top of that average
 
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
you know that is not taking into
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
consideration the expenses that people
 
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
actually have to pay here and especially
 
01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
with the housing
 
01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:00.109 align:start position:0%
with the housing
um

01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it the
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
increase in housing costs I think those
 
01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
again the middle income are hard hit by
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
that because those are the neighborhoods
 
01:48:12.649 --> 01:48:12.659 align:start position:0%
that went up up most in uh value and
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
pricing because that's where people are
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
really trying to move to and there were
 
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
bidding wars over houses so and I know
 
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
rents have gone up for those who are
 
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
renting so I'm so it's not unreasonable
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
that we're paying more I mean we should
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
be paying more or giving more here
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
um especially as I said in the Southern
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
Tier of the state I know it's very
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
expensive and that includes Manchester
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
um it's very expensive to live and so
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
basing it on the National Poverty Level
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of artificial to begin
 
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
with thank you further questions from
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh for taking
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
um my concern this is related to my
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
question my concern with having a cap at
 
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
all is that it could encourage people to
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
earn Less in order to go below that cap
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how that would pertain
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
how does this bill relate to that issue
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
well as I said I would prefer no cap
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
but we have a cap and so to that end I'm
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
trying to at least capture some of those
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
people who are paying their taxes who
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
are working hard who want the same
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities for their kids and they
 
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
just can't make it and yes any cap is
 
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
going to have that
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
waterfall Cliff effect
 
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:39.590 align:start position:0%
waterfall Cliff effect
um

01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to push that out to be able
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
to get as many as parents who really
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
can't afford
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
um to send their kids to the where
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it is their kids need and I'll
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
tell you a school stamp can we have
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
another question here so we can you know
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
move on a little bit here we need
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
01:50:01.619 --> 01:50:02.930 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps in Woodcock yeah I thought I saw
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
your hand up thank you our Channel
 
01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I said
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay from yesterday
 
01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.109 align:start position:0%
okay from yesterday
[Laughter]

01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
the initial uh EFA bill will put in if I
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
recall a language I don't have I don't
 
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
have my law book here to flip through by
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
the way we won't get you a a yellow one
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
how about that thank you thank you
 
01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's the old one thank you chairman uh
 
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
you know the old book that we don't have
 
01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
here for the new people uh in that
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
particular BFA it the intent was to
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
provide options for uh students from
 
01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
parents who made under the 300 poverty
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
level is that correct actually when the
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
EFA started and when it first came
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
before our committee there was no cap
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
okay but I mean the law that went in the
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
law that went in was a compromise and
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
put on a cap and because of the cap we
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
are seeing parents and kids being harmed
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is to try to uh remedy that
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
the representative of the lab it
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that the the 500 percent that
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
you put in is 138 according to the New
 
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank you 38. the the uh
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
me income public income in New Hampshire
 
01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:24.020 align:start position:0%
2022 was 83 8 000. as 55 000 difference
 
01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
between immediate income and the five
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
percent and I would suggest to you that
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
Conway the media income because they
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
have it broken down by Town calling
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
immediate income is 57.6
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
so when you're saying that this bill is
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
going to 500 percent uh poverty level
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
and we're now up 138 000 that's clearly
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
not what the bill was intended for to
 
01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
start with but the the building law so
 
01:51:54.169 --> 01:51:54.179 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out how your
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill aligns with the intent of the law
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
to help low-income families we are
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
talking about an income of 138 000 which
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
is fifty five thousand dollars more than
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
the media income well at the time when I
 
01:52:11.090 --> 01:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
came up with that number the median
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
income was a hundred and that's where I
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
think the 111 was is hitting my brain
 
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
that was the median in the state average
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
um somebody wanted one son 111 is 400
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative correct so 400 would hit
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
the median income
 
01:52:30.169 --> 01:52:30.179 align:start position:0%
no maybe at the time it's not been there
 
01:52:32.209 --> 01:52:32.219 align:start position:0%
where are you getting the media family
 
01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
of four the New Hampshire 2022 census oh
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
we'll see and I came up with the numbers
 
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:39.980 align:start position:0%
prior to this oh yeah
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
but my question is my I I will stick
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
with when the EFA was come up with when
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
it first hit when we tried to get it
 
01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
passed there was no cap because it was
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
not intended as just for low income that
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
got changed
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
that's what went in luck I'm trying to
 
01:53:03.609 --> 01:53:03.619 align:start position:0%
head back towards the initial
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
priority which was all kids in the state
 
01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
not just lower income because lower
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
income have other options
 
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
middle income do not
 
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the further questions no
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I know that we're
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
hearing obviously concerns that uh money
 
01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
would be flowing to wealthy families who
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
can afford it and we can have that
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
ideological discussion another time so
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
my question to you is in a time when you
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
go to the shopping the grocery store and
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
you you might be paying ten dollars a
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
dozen for eggs is a hundred and forty
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year for a family
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
wealthy or do you think that's middle
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
class that was my point that according
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
to the people that I talked to at the
 
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
state in various
 
01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:55.750 align:start position:0%
state in various
people

01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
600 percent would would Encompass all of
 
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
the middle class and so I was being
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
conservative with 500 percent and with
 
01:54:09.649 --> 01:54:09.659 align:start position:0%
the way prices are going up now no we're
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
not we're not talking wealthy we're
 
01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.370 align:start position:0%
not we're not talking wealthy we're
talking

01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
you know trying to get the middle income
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
people the people who cannot pay for
 
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
these special and as an example
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
a family has a number of
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
and what they were doing before
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
because as we know there are very few
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know the the resources are slim and
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
there are only certain specialists
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
around in a lot of schools yeah they
 
01:54:46.250 --> 01:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
have them and yeah the kid has an IEP
 
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
but no they're not getting the services
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not available
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
she found somebody who was quite a drive
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
away but she could only afford to take
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
the oldest kid twice a year that was all
 
01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
she could afford she did get she her
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
family does just barely meet the EFA
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
requirements she now all the kids are
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
being able to get
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
the need the the
 
01:55:11.639 --> 01:55:12.590 align:start position:0%
the need the the
um

01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
their needs met and each one has
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
slightly different learning disabilities
 
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
and the specialist has been able to
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
address each of the kids and she can go
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
more than once a year and all the
 
01:55:27.649 --> 01:55:27.659 align:start position:0%
all of the kids excuse me are actually
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
getting the services that they need
 
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
which they could not before the EFA
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm struggling with the penmanship
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
cursive here on this and
 
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
and that must be me it says cities on
 
01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's a c a r i s a r c u r o w
 
01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:08.450 align:start position:0%
it's a c a r i s a r c u r o w
Crow

01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.209 --> 01:56:11.219 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:56:11.219 --> 01:56:13.070 align:start position:0%
oh okay
okay

01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:17.169 --> 01:56:17.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.490 --> 01:56:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
sorry about that I see that
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
um a long time since I've been here uh
 
01:56:30.169 --> 01:56:30.179 align:start position:0%
so very similar topic
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
um talking about education Freedom
 
01:56:33.649 --> 01:56:33.659 align:start position:0%
accounts again and uh the eligibility
 
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
for that so uh as I said before my name
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
is Sarah Scott and I'm the director of
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
Grassroots operations with Americans for
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire and we
 
01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
are here in support of this bill
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
um so this legislation is really to
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
continue expanding the program so that
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
every child in New Hampshire can have
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
access to the education that best fits
 
01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
them we've heard a lot of positive
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
stories coming out of the current
 
01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts program of
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
families who are now able to access an
 
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
education that they couldn't before
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
we're seeing kids that are happier
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
succeeding more in school academically
 
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
um and I know we don't have enough time
 
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
to really collect a lot of data on this
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
yet but the the initial stories coming
 
01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
out of it seem overwhelmingly positive
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
but uh in all of this there have been a
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
lot of sad stories as well there have
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
been a lot of stories that I've heard
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
from parents who to say I know you've
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
been involved in this legislation what
 
01:57:31.089 --> 01:57:31.099 align:start position:0%
is 300 what does that mean
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
and when you explain it to them
 
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
they go through the numbers and they
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
have come to me and said I'm over that
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
so what what are my options and the
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
tough thing is there aren't options
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
um if you can't figure out how to make
 
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
it work in your current budget you're
 
01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
really your option is your current
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
status quo the toughest story that I
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
think I heard I just wanted to highlight
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
here was from a mom of four kids and she
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
said you know unlike a lot of families
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
whose income dropped during covid hers
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually went up it was going to be a
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
temporary increase in income it wasn't
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
something she expected over the long run
 
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
so she knew that she would be back down
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
to her current income the next year but
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
that temporary boost in income actually
 
01:58:19.729 --> 01:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
put her over the limit by I know it was
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
under a thousand dollars I think it
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
might have been under eight hundred
 
01:58:25.609 --> 01:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
dollars such a small amount and when
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the the sacrifice that
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
these kids are then going to have to
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
make they have to wait another year
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
another year in an education system them
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
that isn't meeting their needs whether
 
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
they were being bullied whether they
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
were unable to get the resources that
 
01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
they needed for their education or
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
whether they just fit better in a
 
01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
different learning environment
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
a year for a child is a really long time
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't be penalizing kids for
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that their parents made eight
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars too much to get the
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
option to find a better education and
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't just a one-off story there
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
are a lot of families like this who
 
01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
don't meet that 300 percent but they're
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
by no means the the rich and the wealthy
 
01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of families who are
 
01:59:09.169 --> 01:59:09.179 align:start position:0%
looking for other options and just
 
01:59:10.729 --> 01:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
trying to find the best education for
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
their child and I think we need to be
 
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're empowering all
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
Granite State families to find what
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
works best for their family so I just
 
01:59:19.850 --> 01:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to close by saying that we ask
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
you to support this legislation and
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
continue allowing these families to find
 
01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.310 align:start position:0%
continue allowing these families to find
options

01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative Luna
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
very much Miss Scott
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned um about the
 
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
success stories and that I think you had
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
said uh there's approximately 3 000 um
 
01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:43.139 align:start position:0%
uh students in the efe program right now
 
01:59:45.410 --> 01:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how many were in their
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
attending their public school full-time
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
the year before they uh did the EFA I
 
01:59:52.970 --> 01:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
believe from the Department of Education
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
that number is 27 but I could be off by
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
a percent or two okay I believe it's 27
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so so
 
02:00:03.410 --> 02:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
um to your testimony
 
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:05.780 align:start position:0%
um most of these students
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
north of north of 70 percent were were
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
already attending either private school
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
or home school and had exercised some
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
Choice prior to receiving taxpayer funds
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so yes
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
they they were but those sacrifices for
 
02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of families weren't sustainable
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of families especially
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
during covid who either for concerns
 
02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
about the learning environment for their
 
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
child for health concerns uh made really
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
significant sacrifices to take their
 
02:00:38.330 --> 02:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
kids to a different education option and
 
02:00:39.970 --> 02:00:39.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of times those weren't sustainable
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
so during covid some parents were able
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
to work from home and home educate their
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
children but that wasn't really going to
 
02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
be an option moving forward so I think
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
that those numbers are not necessarily
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
reflective of the kids that would have
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
typically been in a public education or
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
kids that would otherwise be able to
 
02:00:58.370 --> 02:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
afford that okay thank you further
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
very much I'd like to invite up David
 
02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:14.229 align:start position:0%
very much I'd like to invite up David
Trumbull

02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
you committee I'm a citizen of where and
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
I come as representing myself here I'm
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill because I believe
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the funding mechanism is is not
 
02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate I don't think it's legal I
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
ran for State Rep this fall I did not
 
02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
win which is why I'm sitting here today
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
though but in doing this I did research
 
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
onto this bill I looked up the education
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
trust fund and as you know it says
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
clearly that the fund shall not be used
 
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
for any purpose other than adequate
 
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
education grants to school districts and
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools I looked up the
 
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
legislative history of that bill it is a
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
150 page document that was written 20
 
02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
years ago a bipartisan and bicameral
 
02:01:58.129 --> 02:01:58.139 align:start position:0%
report House and Senate alike in a
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
distinguished group of people from the
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
community they looked at in this bill
 
02:02:05.089 --> 02:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
entirely funds going to solve the
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
problem of the property Rich towns and
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
the property poor towns there is not a
 
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
single mention of there of giving money
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
to parents or to private schools the
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
money has to go to the school districts
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
for the town schools and Charter Schools
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
under that law taking the money from it
 
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
for this purpose even if it's a worthy
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
purpose even if every testimony you've
 
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
heard today is true it's outside of the
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
purposes of the original Law there's a
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty to manage a trust fund
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the legislator's duty we
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
have violated that trust because that
 
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
money should be returned to the trust
 
02:02:43.609 --> 02:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
fund so that the children in Claremont
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
and Franklin and where in Pittsfield and
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
Rochester and Allenstown and all the
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
schools that towns that don't have
 
02:02:51.649 --> 02:02:51.659 align:start position:0%
enough property tax base they should be
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
getting the money from the education
 
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
trust fund so that their schools and
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
their charter schools are adequately
 
02:02:59.089 --> 02:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
funded if we want to do this additional
 
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
funding it should be funded through its
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
own funding source and then if it's
 
02:03:05.770 --> 02:03:05.780 align:start position:0%
going to be something where the the
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor said every child has a right to
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
this money from the state then they're
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
basically being a state actor and all
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
these private schools should then be
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
required to meet the requirements of the
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
state that puts on on a public school
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
for instance RSA 19338 which says no
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
person shall be subject to
 
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination in public schools if
 
02:03:27.649 --> 02:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
we're going to solve problems in public
 
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
schools by basically having private
 
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
actors become public schools then they
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
should be forced to also comply with
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
these rules with of no discrimination
 
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to say is I've
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
heard the commissioner say this bill
 
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
will save schools money that doesn't
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
make any sense because if you have towns
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
Port property towns that have five or
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
ten percent of their children go off to
 
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
these private schools they're going to
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
be getting less money from the state but
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
they still have fixed expenses those
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
fixed expenses don't go away so the
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
operating money that will be available
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
for the remaining students will be less
 
02:04:04.729 --> 02:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
per student the rich towns can make that
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
up they can go back and raise their
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
local property taxes and provide a super
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
education for their children but the gap
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
between the have-nots and haves in this
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
state will be widened by this bill if
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
you don't restore the money back to the
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund where it was originally
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
intended the Supreme Court looked at
 
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
this constitution 20 years ago and all
 
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.179 align:start position:0%
those Claremont decisions and said this
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
money should be going to the property
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
poor towns we as a state heavy duty duty
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
to do that we have not done that and
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we have all these problems
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with today we've got
 
02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
to go back to the beginning fix that
 
02:04:40.850 --> 02:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
problem first and this can be a
 
02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
secondary approach but we have ignored
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
the original problem that's my opinion
 
02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much you're
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad that my name is spelled
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
better or maybe just had a good memory
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Campbell and um you know
 
02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:10.679 align:start position:0%
still former rep here in House Education
 
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I do support this bill and I'd like
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify things because I was heavily
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
involved uh oddly enough in the bill
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
that is education funding and what we're
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
talking about is the adequate education
 
02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
grant and the state has an obligation to
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
provide that to students who are
 
02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
receiving an adequate education parents
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
have a compulsory obligation to make
 
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
sure their kids are receiving an
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:38.540 align:start position:0%
so the institution that I helped start
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
provides an adequate education for about
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
30 students right now that's what we do
 
02:05:47.330 --> 02:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
it's a public service that we provide so
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
that parents can check the box that
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
their kids are receiving an adequate
 
02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:54.659 align:start position:0%
education the bill before you limits
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
their ability to get that adequate
 
02:05:58.910 --> 02:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
education grant unless they make less
 
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
than 500 percent of the poverty level
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
I support this bill I think that's a
 
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
good compromise Bill yes I too would
 
02:06:08.689 --> 02:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
rather see no limit because I think you
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
have a fundamental and I will say to you
 
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
that when I put in things like average
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
members in Residence is how you
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
determine the amount of the adequate
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
education grant the funding going to a
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
town like Farmington but when you get
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
the grant as a school district it's in
 
02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:25.850 align:start position:0%
the grant as a school district it's in
attendance

02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
so you live in a town your town gets you
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
counted in your education funding money
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
but you money goes only if you attend
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
that school
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
and that was with purpose and import and
 
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say oh yeah this 20-year
 
02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
vision of you back in 20 years to have
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
this argument or maybe it took me 20
 
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
years to clearly see what the law really
 
02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
says the law says we have an obligation
 
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
to provide funding of x amount set in
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
biennium every two years and by the way
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much the same as what it was
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
20 years ago
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
we kind of just set it at that 3 700
 
02:07:04.010 --> 02:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
level every biennium and hasn't
 
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
increased in the last 20 years
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a problem but that's
 
02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
not what this bill is about but what
 
02:07:12.649 --> 02:07:12.659 align:start position:0%
this bill is about is for
 
02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
um adequate Educational Services that we
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
provide that parents should get that
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
money because they're fulfilling that
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
obligation so if you really want to look
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
at what you have you have a
 
02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue here you know
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
people say oh is it illegal illegal here
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
I am similarly situated I have a student
 
02:07:34.010 --> 02:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
myself I'm over the income limit and he
 
02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
attends a school and gets an a private
 
02:07:36.179 --> 02:07:37.370 align:start position:0%
attends a school and gets an a private
education

02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
but because I'm over an income limit my
 
02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
student doesn't get the adequate
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
education grant so although as a parent
 
02:07:46.729 --> 02:07:46.739 align:start position:0%
and as a student we're just the same
 
02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
getting an adequate education as anybody
 
02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:49.669 align:start position:0%
getting an adequate education as anybody
else

02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
that book that they hand out to you when
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
you get sworn in has some stuff in it
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not a constitutional expert or
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
Thumper but basically you're entitled to
 
02:08:01.550 --> 02:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
be treated equally under the law
 
02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
if you have an income limit people
 
02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
similarly situated are not being
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
treatedly equally so when I said earlier
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
I want to challenge your mind I want to
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
challenge your heart I want you to at
 
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
least be open to the possibility of
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
doing something that's right doing
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
something that's constitutional doing
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
something that makes our society fair
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
and equal
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
I should not because I have a bigger
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
wallet than the next guy say that my
 
02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
religious freedom and my choices are
 
02:08:27.530 --> 02:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
dependent only upon the size of my
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
wallet that's not what our constitution
 
02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
says I have a right to choice and
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
religious freedom regardless of how much
 
02:08:34.609 --> 02:08:34.619 align:start position:0%
money I have and when people say to me
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
oh you can exercise that right as long
 
02:08:37.729 --> 02:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
as you have money to pay for it that's
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
fundamentally flawed
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
the adequate education grant should go
 
02:08:43.490 --> 02:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
where to the institution that's
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
providing the adequate education and
 
02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
right now under law the mechanism to do
 
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
that is the EFA account because if it
 
02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
was to a public or a government-run
 
02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
school it would go to the town and then
 
02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
the town sends it to the school district
 
02:08:57.050 --> 02:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
but since we don't have a big town that
 
02:08:58.570 --> 02:08:58.580 align:start position:0%
represents all these different
 
02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers or Charter Schools or all
 
02:09:02.689 --> 02:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
those different opportunities get the
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant the law
 
02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
provides for scholarship organization to
 
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
manage those funds and have an account
 
02:09:11.570 --> 02:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
for those kids and those accounts get
 
02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
distributed just like education funding
 
02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
gets distributed four times a year and
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
comes to our institution most of our
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
kids are getting that Grant which by the
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
way our tuition is six thousand dollars
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
the grant doesn't cover the whole six
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars those people are still
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
contributing they're still doing stuff
 
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
so you have this fundamentally thing
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
about not treating people equally so I
 
02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
don't want the whole Community to blow
 
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
up like I made the confident about
 
02:09:35.570 --> 02:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
unions I apologize didn't mean to be
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
inflammatory but I do want you to
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
consider this the other way you could
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
fix it if you're going to have an income
 
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
limit whether it's 300 percent or 500
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.609 --> 02:09:49.619 align:start position:0%
put it on public schools
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
I'm a rich guy why shouldn't I pay the 3
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
700 bucks for my kid to attend
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
Farmington High School I make more than
 
02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
300 of the poverty level
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then at least it's treating
 
02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
everybody the same
 
02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
so I think you have to do one or two
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
things and what I'd like this community
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
to consider doing and whether there's an
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
appetite for subcommittees for these two
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
bills I'd be happy to see if there's a
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
compromise that can be made and I do
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
believe there's a compromise to be made
 
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
because I've done it we can do it we can
 
02:10:19.129 --> 02:10:19.139 align:start position:0%
work together it's possible you don't
 
02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in my head up here
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
I have things that you will love
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you can do is if
 
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
you're if you're if you're gonna deal
 
02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
with this issue and you're going to
 
02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
admit that there's a constitutional
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
issue because you're treating people
 
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
similarly situated differently and
 
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing
 
02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
then send it to the opinion of the
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
justices because both sides of these
 
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
arguments I mean my goodness there we
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
have a committee that pretty much we
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
know how people are voting I was you
 
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
know on the committee I knew I could
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
count noses before we even had the
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and I certainly think we could
 
02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
do that today
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
so let's send it to the opinion of the
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
justices let's ask them that question
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
because one side believes adamantly it's
 
02:11:01.609 --> 02:11:01.619 align:start position:0%
wrong and shouldn't be done and the law
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
says only government schools and the
 
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
other side or at least me I don't know I
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the side says that it
 
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
can be done they're getting an adequate
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
education just like Catholic Charities
 
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
gets government money for providing
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
social service programs
 
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
schools whether religious or otherwise
 
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
they're homeschoolers if they're
 
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
providing that adequate education they
 
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
should get the grant that's as simple as
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
I can put it this bill at least brings
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
it for people like my daughter and my
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
son-in-law who make about 90 000 a year
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
they'd be right on the cusp of that 400
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
percent and I wouldn't want it to be
 
02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
that close so I think 500 percent
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
encapsulates these young kids making 22
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
an hour making a sacrifice of six
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year to send their
 
02:11:43.370 --> 02:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
kid to a school and there's all kinds of
 
02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.139 align:start position:0%
families doing that and if and if we had
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
we're built to have 60 students and I do
 
02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
believe that we would get to 60 students
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
if you lift the income limit or you
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
lifted it to 500 and then if we had that
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
number of students and the people paying
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
we could meet our budget because right
 
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
now you know where our budget comes from
 
02:12:01.609 --> 02:12:01.619 align:start position:0%
right here
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't mind doing it I ain't gonna
 
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
do it forever
 
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
I can't afford to do it forever I'm not
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
that rich of a guy
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
but I didn't want to see no Catholic
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
Education in the Tri-City area and the
 
02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
Rochester region because we're closing
 
02:12:17.570 --> 02:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
schools left and right and we got to
 
02:12:19.149 --> 02:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
stop closing schools by stop
 
02:12:21.169 --> 02:12:21.179 align:start position:0%
discriminating against who gets their
 
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant that money
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
belongs to the parent and the student
 
02:12:27.649 --> 02:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
and that's what the state law says we
 
02:12:29.209 --> 02:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to fund an adequate
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
education quickly chairman Dover
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
we pass education funding and we had a
 
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
stop Gap it meant that if you're you're
 
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
funding targeted aid went up more than
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
20 in one year you couldn't get the rest
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
of the money
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
we had to put that in for compromise and
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
education funding right
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
over sued and said wait a minute we have
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
more than that we have the students to
 
02:12:52.250 --> 02:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
overrun that lawsuit because they were
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
adequately educating more students so
 
02:12:56.290 --> 02:12:56.300 align:start position:0%
their money they should have got
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
extended the cap so we already have
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
court cases that say if you're educating
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
the student you get the Grant and I
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
think they should again I support
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
government-run schools I support all
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire I just think
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
if we have a robust uh community of
 
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities our educational level at
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
the secondary level can be just as good
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
as our educational level at the college
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
level the college level in the United
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
States is very robust very effective
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
best in the world the secondary level
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
where we rate down with third world
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
countries or you know not at the top
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with the structure of
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
how we do it we shouldn't have 90 plus
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
percent of our kids in the
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
government-run school and only a small
 
02:13:36.589 --> 02:13:36.599 align:start position:0%
percentage in private other schools that
 
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
they choose I think if that was more
 
02:13:40.729 --> 02:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
balanced 50 50 where do we want to be in
 
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
20 years that's what I'm asking you
 
02:13:44.930 --> 02:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
having looked at where we are 20 years
 
02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
later I think that's the question we
 
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
should all be searching our souls and
 
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
saying instead of worried about this oh
 
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
gosh it's public it's mine where are we
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
going to be in 20 years and I hope that
 
02:13:58.609 --> 02:13:58.619 align:start position:0%
um thank you all I know I'm passionate
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
about this so thank you for your service
 
02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
all of you everybody thank you very much
 
02:14:04.850 --> 02:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
Naseem thank you very much
 
02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:18.169 --> 02:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
um hello I'm Kate West thank you for the
 
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony today
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm here in opposition to this bill
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
um I believe that we don't
 
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
often apply this same logic to other
 
02:14:32.770 --> 02:14:32.780 align:start position:0%
public programs and community services
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
and I think it is a dangerous precedent
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
to set if I came to you and told you
 
02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
that I didn't think the fire department
 
02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
served my family well because we live in
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
a more rural area and I don't trust that
 
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
the fire department is going to come in
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
an emergency for me I would like you to
 
02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
use public funds for me to put a
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system into my home
 
02:14:59.930 --> 02:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
you might say well how about we look at
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
what the issue is with the fire
 
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
department and try and solve that
 
02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
problem right if I told you the police
 
02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
department same thing I want a private
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
security system in my home I want you to
 
02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
divert tax dollars so that I can protect
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
my home in the way that is best for my
 
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.689 align:start position:0%
my home in the way that is best for my
family

02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's not how we do public programs and
 
02:15:19.129 --> 02:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
com and Community efforts we sit
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
together and we say why is this failing
 
02:15:23.450 --> 02:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
you how can we make sure that this
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
service does not fail you
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
this is how I feel about our public
 
02:15:31.069 --> 02:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
school system I do not disagree with
 
02:15:34.129 --> 02:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
folks that say my student is being left
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
behind and underserved and I would like
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
the public school system
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
to be held accountable for that
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
I disagree with the idea that diverting
 
02:15:48.189 --> 02:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
funds away from our public schools and
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
putting that effort into private systems
 
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
is going to help solve that problem in
 
02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools I think that our
 
02:15:57.770 --> 02:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
Public Schools need
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
more community support and
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
to be invested in further in order to
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
close those gaps in order to make sure
 
02:16:08.810 --> 02:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
that the students that go to public
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
schools every student gets the education
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
that they deserve another issue that I
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
continue to hear is the definition of an
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
adequate education and as was
 
02:16:20.890 --> 02:16:20.900 align:start position:0%
stated earlier
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
you know our public schools are held to
 
02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
specific standards on what that
 
02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
definition is that private
 
02:16:34.009 --> 02:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
schools are not helped to those same
 
02:16:37.849 --> 02:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
standards so in essence using tax
 
02:16:41.089 --> 02:16:41.099 align:start position:0%
dollars to provide a private education
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
that is not under the same standards
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
it's there's no way to say hey this
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
really is an adequate education if we're
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
not holding folks to those same
 
02:16:54.169 --> 02:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
standards as our Public Schools so
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
instead of diverting funds away and
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
giving that money to private citizens to
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
use as they see fit in order to provide
 
02:17:03.650 --> 02:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
education for their children I would
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
like to see us work with our public
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
schools and make sure that they are
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
adequately funded and have the programs
 
02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
that they need in order to serve all of
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
our students
 
02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:16.849 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
questions

02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:16.859 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just trying to
 
02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
understand in the same manner that
 
02:17:25.129 --> 02:17:25.139 align:start position:0%
you're understanding the the point that
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
you made about public services and how
 
02:17:28.009 --> 02:17:28.019 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
how we typically administer a public
 
02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
service because when I think of police
 
02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
or fire
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
I think of if you call the police
 
02:17:37.490 --> 02:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
because somebody's broken into your home
 
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
the states being the police comes to
 
02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
your home
 
02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
and they don't they provide an
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
individualized service on that occasion
 
02:17:47.810 --> 02:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
they don't arrest you because that's
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
just standard practice when you call the
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
fire department they come to your home
 
02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
they don't if you have your house on
 
02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
fire they don't put a ladder up to take
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
a cat out of a tree they provide an
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
individualized service to you at your
 
02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
individualized service to you at your
home

02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:18:01.679 --> 02:18:02.570 align:start position:0%
home
um

02:18:02.570 --> 02:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to understand that the
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
manner in which this is so Divergent
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.129 --> 02:18:16.139 align:start position:0%
I live on a hill in a rural community so
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
it's my belief that the fire department
 
02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
won't be able to get to my home in time
 
02:18:22.849 --> 02:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
I don't trust that service is adequately
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
serving me I would like to instead use
 
02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:28.139 align:start position:0%
public funds to have a private solution
 
02:18:30.889 --> 02:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
and put a sprinkler system in my home so
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
I don't have to be dependent on that
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
public service that is
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
a problem okay that public service
 
02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
should be serving that home in a rural
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
community that's 20 minutes away we
 
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
should find a solution to make sure that
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that fire does get put out rather than
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
saying you know what we hear you so
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
here's some money for you to solve that
 
02:18:54.650 --> 02:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
problem on your own as a community we
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
should be solving problems together
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
02:18:59.810 --> 02:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you through the questions
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:19:04.370 --> 02:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
um just as a follow-up on that
 
02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:08.290 align:start position:0%
um just as a follow-up on that
um

02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:08.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
does your fire department your police
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
department and your particular community
 
02:19:16.310 --> 02:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
um do they go through a budget review
 
02:19:19.490 --> 02:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
and accountability review uh every year
 
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then send a worn article or an
 
02:19:25.129 --> 02:19:25.139 align:start position:0%
article to the town I think where we are
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
now when we're talking about police and
 
02:19:29.089 --> 02:19:29.099 align:start position:0%
fire here I I see
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to parallel but let's
 
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
talk about this bill please and the 500
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
percent increasing it to the 500 from
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
the 300 that's where we need to okay
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
I'll ask a question on that do you do
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
you see that raising this um or even
 
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
providing the initial funds for the for
 
02:19:50.210 --> 02:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts has the
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
kind of accountability by elected
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
officials both academically and fiscally
 
02:20:01.490 --> 02:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
Nancy thank you very much
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite uh Kate Baker Demers
 
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
so much to unpack today I'm Kate Baker
 
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
Demers I'm the executive director of
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund and I was
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
dismayed though this morning to hear
 
02:20:20.349 --> 02:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
that you've had hours of presentations
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education but
 
02:20:24.410 --> 02:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
they haven't given you any of those
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
types of reports the fiscal reports the
 
02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
vendor reports the expense reports we've
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
been reporting to them quarterly so I
 
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
did decide that I'm going to create our
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
own annual report and I'll bring that to
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
you I don't know how long it will take
 
02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
me to put all the stuff together that
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
we've been reporting to the Department
 
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
of Ed but my apologies that you didn't
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
receive a full presentation with all of
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
those pieces of information a lot of the
 
02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
questions that people asked today would
 
02:20:53.929 --> 02:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
have been answered in advance and so my
 
02:20:55.610 --> 02:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
apologies for that what I would like to
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
address though is the actual data around
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
this 500 percent of the poverty line
 
02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
um 334 children applied for the
 
02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts that were
 
02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
over the income limit
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
um by ten thousand dollars so they would
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
fit into this group
 
02:21:17.809 --> 02:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
um less than about 95 of them
 
02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
were less than 10 000 over the limit so
 
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
they've got that's your people that were
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
either one dollar over or ten thousand
 
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
dollars over
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
172 children would fall into the bucket
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
of one dollar over to twenty thousand
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
dollars over so that's the group of
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
people that you're looking at you're
 
02:21:39.469 --> 02:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
looking at about few hundred children
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
that you would add I also brought the
 
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
guidelines with me I it's funny that I
 
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm chuckling to myself that I'm I'm the
 
02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
only one that brought the guidelines so
 
02:21:50.690 --> 02:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
I can make a copy of it for you if you
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
want you guys or I can just read it to
 
02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:54.230 align:start position:0%
want you guys or I can just read it to
you

02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:21:56.690 --> 02:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
um in essence most of the people that
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
this would impact are your single parent
 
02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
with one child so the income limit for
 
02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
the single parent with one child at 300
 
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
percent of the poverty line is 54 000
 
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
and so it's those single parents that
 
02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
are making sixty thousand who tend to
 
02:22:17.210 --> 02:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
struggle with any kind of realizing any
 
02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
kind of different opportunity for
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
themselves because they just don't have
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
the disposable income to do it and so it
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
seems like increasing the income limits
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
to 500 percent would income impact
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
mostly those people that are one parent
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
one child because that's where the
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
income limit is quite low so the
 
02:22:41.090 --> 02:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
difference between that single parent at
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
with one child at 300 percent is fifty
 
02:22:47.929 --> 02:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
four nine thirty that would raise it
 
02:22:50.330 --> 02:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
really all the way up to and I'm getting
 
02:22:53.050 --> 02:22:53.060 align:start position:0%
a little old so you have to excuse me
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
91 500 and so that does capture a big
 
02:22:59.090 --> 02:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
group of those
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
single parents who otherwise are
 
02:23:03.650 --> 02:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
excluded from the program those are the
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
ones that that hurt my heart a little
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
bit that I wish I could help that I
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
can't and so I think this does that the
 
02:23:13.730 --> 02:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
other thing to consider is
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I'll just tell you one one of these
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
income stories
 
02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
a young little boy
 
02:23:22.730 --> 02:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
with autism he was having
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
um outbursts he was in essence dangerous
 
02:23:28.730 --> 02:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
to the people around him in the school
 
02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
um he lives with his grandparents
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
because the opioid crisis his
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
grandmother was concerned if in the
 
02:23:36.050 --> 02:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
school he kept being a discipline
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
problem and having these violent
 
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
outbursts that he would endanger the
 
02:23:42.770 --> 02:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
people around him she pulled him out
 
02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
with one of our scholarships and moved
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
him to a Montessori School where he was
 
02:23:48.889 --> 02:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
less stimulated because he worked
 
02:23:51.469 --> 02:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
independently using those Montessori
 
02:23:54.530 --> 02:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
materials after three years of doing
 
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
Montessori he was more well adjusted and
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't having any more of those violent
 
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.429 align:start position:0%
wasn't having any more of those violent
outbursts

02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
outbursts
 
02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
um the again Elizabeth's grandparents
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
they got a roof leak on their little
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
house and the grandfather is a
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
tradesperson he went out and did work to
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
make money to fix the roof and that put
 
02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
them over the income limits that's why
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the education freedom account they
 
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
said that once you're in the program you
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
stay in the program and I know we could
 
02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
debate that you know all day whether we
 
02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
like that or not but the reason that
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
they did that was this type of scenario
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
where this family went over the income
 
02:24:33.770 --> 02:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
limits for one period of time and then
 
02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
went back down to the income limits you
 
02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
know I know some of you may like this
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
program in this room and some of you may
 
02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
not like the program I do see it as part
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
of the public education system that is
 
02:24:48.130 --> 02:24:48.140 align:start position:0%
is public education and and
 
02:24:50.929 --> 02:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and in that way I agree
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
with some of the testimony that we've
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
heard today that the income limits don't
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily make sense right again when
 
02:24:58.670 --> 02:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
I go to the door of the public school
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
they don't say are you 300 the poverty
 
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
line I agree with the testimony that
 
02:25:05.389 --> 02:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
it's the adequate education money should
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
be for all the children in the state
 
02:25:08.929 --> 02:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
particularly since the Claremont rulings
 
02:25:11.690 --> 02:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
and those those Supreme Court rulings so
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
I would love to answer questions about
 
02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
this I understand that many of you have
 
02:25:18.050 --> 02:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
questions about how the education
 
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
Freedom account operates what the
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
families have been doing their test
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
scores all of that information is
 
02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
available at the doe and I'm pledging to
 
02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
you to build you a package that answers
 
02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
all of those questions so I'm happy to
 
02:25:34.849 --> 02:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
answer questions about this instead of
 
02:25:36.770 --> 02:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
that and if you would just allow me the
 
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
time to get that to you I would
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate that very much
 
02:25:41.929 --> 02:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Kate you're welcome
 
02:25:43.250 --> 02:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
Burris for being here I'm happy to see
 
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
you representative miler in person I'm
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
glad you're well uh thank and I thank
 
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
you for your commitment to do to provide
 
02:25:56.330 --> 02:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
that information my pleasure because
 
02:25:59.389 --> 02:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
frankly the transparency of this program
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
is is I thought you would have a
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
presentation from the doe as because
 
02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
again I consider as part of the public
 
02:26:07.849 --> 02:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
education system I thought you would
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
have had our presentation already and
 
02:26:11.450 --> 02:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna you know say maybe they
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
intended to do it still to come and we
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
just didn't get ahead of it and so yeah
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'll definitely get you all the stuff I
 
02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
mean quarterly reports we send them so
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy to you know pull it put
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
it together it might not be beautiful
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
but I'll do my best to get that you know
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe give me a month or so to build
 
02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
something for you guys but thank you all
 
02:26:32.330 --> 02:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
the questions that were asked today were
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
quite simple to answer
 
02:26:37.969 --> 02:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
so so yeah so so my question okay great
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your my pleasure pending
 
02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
report the question is is that in my
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
understanding and my as we've dealt with
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
this on this committee is that the
 
02:26:49.849 --> 02:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
original intent of the EFA program was
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
to provide funding for underserved and
 
02:26:56.090 --> 02:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
impoverished parents
 
02:26:58.910 --> 02:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
this program notwithstanding your
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
comments about the Gap that this would
 
02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
provide sure this does ex this does go
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
beyond would you agree that does go
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
beyond the original intent of the
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
program so the original Bill didn't have
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
income limits I think the original bill
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
on this education Freedom account is to
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
allow every child access to that
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
adequate education or meet our
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to provide
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
every child the opportunity for an
 
02:27:25.849 --> 02:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
adequate education I think what you
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
might be feeling representative Miler is
 
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
my my personal intent in fact is to help
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
low-income families and kids that are
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
bullied or that need a different
 
02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
alternative and so when I talk to you
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
about it in my mind that's why I do the
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
work personally is to help low-income
 
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
kids and kids that possibly don't fit or
 
02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
need to go to the Montessori school for
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
a little while or something like that
 
02:27:51.530 --> 02:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
and so I don't want to conflate the two
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
I think the scholarship programs intent
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
is what you're describing but I I think
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account was along
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
the lines of ensuring that every child
 
02:28:03.770 --> 02:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
has access to their adequate education
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
grant since its per pupil funding I
 
02:28:09.170 --> 02:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
think that was the intent of the
 
02:28:10.969 --> 02:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account follow-up
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
please yes I do believe that Senate bill
 
02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
193. so now going back to 2018 exactly
 
02:28:19.969 --> 02:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
okay which was which was the original
 
02:28:22.750 --> 02:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
yeah when it was first brought forward
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
by the Senate I do believe it did have
 
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
an income I think the first one was for
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
special needs kids
 
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
group Glenn's Glenn representative
 
02:28:35.389 --> 02:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
cordelli wants to answer your question I
 
02:28:35.399 --> 02:28:36.370 align:start position:0%
cordelli wants to answer your question I
think

02:28:36.370 --> 02:28:36.380 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:28:39.490 --> 02:28:39.500 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely yeah yeah
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
tax credit stuff and let's not go there
 
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
right now okay fair enough but I think
 
02:28:46.130 --> 02:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:28:48.889 --> 02:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
education savings account Bill may have
 
02:28:50.809 --> 02:28:50.819 align:start position:0%
had income limits thank you I don't I
 
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for offering to
 
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
do this report I think it will be very
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
enlightening totally
 
02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering there'll be things in
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
it you don't like though I'm sure oh no
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
there'll be things you like and you
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't like but I'm I'm happy I'm fine
 
02:29:10.849 --> 02:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
with that right yeah sure
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
um now that the now that this program is
 
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
off and running and you've got uh you
 
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
know it's you've got a number of people
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh taking part of it and that the
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund gets the 10 uh cut that
 
02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:26.750 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund gets the 10 uh cut that
perhaps

02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
um have you considered using some of
 
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
that money which you may not use because
 
02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
the initial startup now is already gone
 
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
yeah to give out special scholarships or
 
02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
grants to these particularly
 
02:29:42.530 --> 02:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
difficult situations where there's a
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
child with autism that doesn't fit into
 
02:29:47.650 --> 02:29:47.660 align:start position:0%
a regular school system uh you know
 
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere on that line to use that
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
rather than expand the income level I
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
love your question because you
 
02:29:57.889 --> 02:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
understand my intent representative
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
Tanner which I really appreciate about
 
02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:01.010 align:start position:0%
Tanner which I really appreciate about
you

02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
um I raise money right now for kids that
 
02:30:05.450 --> 02:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
don't meet the income limits the
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
challenge is remember they're both hard
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
ceilings and so if a family doesn't meet
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
the income limits we can't help them at
 
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
all we would have to raise that money
 
02:30:16.969 --> 02:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
and I can do that sometimes but again
 
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
when you go around just raising money
 
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
people only give you a certain amount
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
right so I'll always run out of that
 
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
money regardless but I do appreciate
 
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
your question and the fact that you
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
understand that my intent is really to
 
02:30:29.809 --> 02:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
help kids that need something you know a
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
bullied kid or or whatnot so thank you
 
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
so much for the question and I'll keep
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
raising money forever and helping as
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
many kids as I can for as long as I can
 
02:30:40.010 --> 02:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
without question yeah
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%

02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
receiving an adequate education I was
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if what where these students
 
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:36.770 align:start position:0%
wondering if what where these students
are

02:31:36.770 --> 02:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:31:39.849 --> 02:31:39.859 align:start position:0%
today if you can tell us of the
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
3200 approximately students how many are
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
now uh and I'm talking about EFA
 
02:31:48.530 --> 02:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
students are now either attending
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
private schools public schools or our
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
home in a homeschool environment so I'm
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to do it from a general because I
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't have that memorized in my head I'm
 
02:32:00.050 --> 02:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
pretty good representative Luna but I
 
02:32:01.490 --> 02:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
want to address your first question
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
first the first part of the question
 
02:32:05.809 --> 02:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
where is to meet every child in the
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
state is a liability to the state okay
 
02:32:09.950 --> 02:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
they are all kids that could happen
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
first I only had one part to the
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
question and it was of the 3200 students
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
where are they yes where are they now so
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
about half of the children are choosing
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
a brick and mortar building school and
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
then about half of them are multi
 
02:32:28.010 --> 02:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
providers meaning they're using more
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
than one building or an online school
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
and or a tutor and and I can remember
 
02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
one example there's a child taking two
 
02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
AP classes is in a public high school
 
02:32:40.969 --> 02:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
two classes at an online school and
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
tutoring for another school and they
 
02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
break down about 50 50. about half the
 
02:32:48.770 --> 02:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
kids are in one provider that looks like
 
02:32:50.270 --> 02:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
a brick and mortar building in New
 
02:32:52.130 --> 02:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and about half the kids are
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
using many providers for one child so
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
they might look like a you might think
 
02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
of them as an educated at home child but
 
02:33:02.690 --> 02:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
they might be in a public school and
 
02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
online school and a private school and
 
02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
using a tutor does that help okay great
 
02:33:10.010 --> 02:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I'll get that's the stuff that
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
you'll get when I give you a an annual
 
02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
report which I would I wish you would
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
have already had that information in
 
02:33:18.050 --> 02:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
02:33:20.570 --> 02:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
the last several questions we've had are
 
02:33:22.250 --> 02:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
dealing with it right more off topic
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
questions but they're off the topic of
 
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
this but they are good questions which
 
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to you would like to
 
02:33:30.290 --> 02:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
see yes the administrative cost at 10
 
02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
yeah that represents right and you know
 
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
that was representative Tanner yeah so
 
02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
if we use less administrative money I
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
get to give more money to kids so it
 
02:33:43.130 --> 02:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
would increase the grants and so I
 
02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely want to do that yeah so those
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
are some of the things which we want to
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
look at in terms of the in the use issue
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
that uh representative luno just looked
 
02:33:53.090 --> 02:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
at but let's keep the rest of the
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions here on target please dealing
 
02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
with this because 500 of the poverty
 
02:33:59.690 --> 02:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
lineable yes yeah representative
 
02:34:02.270 --> 02:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
Woodcock was your hand up
 
02:34:04.910 --> 02:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes it was chairman thank you uh thank
 
02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:06.780 align:start position:0%

see you again this year uh and I
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you're willing
 
02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
to at least present the work that Doe
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
has yet to present I love talking about
 
02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
my work on either of these bills
 
02:34:20.809 --> 02:34:20.819 align:start position:0%
considering the major uh doe bills and
 
02:34:22.370 --> 02:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
they're not here to speak to the bill
 
02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
which I find uh said and that that being
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
said Mike my question is uh in the
 
02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
earlier bill
 
02:34:29.700 --> 02:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
earlier bill
um

02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah because you may have the answer the
 
02:34:34.969 --> 02:34:34.979 align:start position:0%
deal he isn't here uh in the earlier
 
02:34:36.650 --> 02:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
bill they indicated and the governor's
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
projected budget he had 30 million
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
dollars yeah in the accounts
 
02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and the question that was raised was
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
that in anticipation of this bill being
 
02:34:50.809 --> 02:34:50.819 align:start position:0%
passed or was that the cover of the
 
02:34:52.849 --> 02:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
current expenses to this or do you know
 
02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
that answers I don't know the answer
 
02:34:56.330 --> 02:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr chair you're
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions representative
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
pardon me thank you yeah represent
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
balbooni oh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:35:07.610 --> 02:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
um earlier today earlier in your
 
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
testimony you referenced um uh the the
 
02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
family unit of a single parent with one
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
child that was successing the program
 
02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering you because you
 
02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
might be brought it as perhaps the spam
 
02:35:21.889 --> 02:35:21.899 align:start position:0%
the situation being but most beneficial
 
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
to that the limit raise here
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
um can you give an idea of how many uh
 
02:35:32.530 --> 02:35:32.540 align:start position:0%
family in that unit yes so of the
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
334 children that applied
 
02:35:38.330 --> 02:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
there were 90 sorry hold on where's my
 
02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:39.469 align:start position:0%
there were 90 sorry hold on where's my
eyesight

02:35:39.469 --> 02:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
eyesight
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
there were less than ten thousand
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
so a small group not very many kids yeah
 
02:35:58.250 --> 02:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
further questions but I do think every
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
kid matters of course right yeah
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you my
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
pleasure can you address the the
 
02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
um idea that the educational trust fund
 
02:36:14.210 --> 02:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
was meant only for publics I really
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
can't okay no I know our whole education
 
02:36:19.309 --> 02:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
spending in the state is three billion I
 
02:36:21.889 --> 02:36:21.899 align:start position:0%
know this is a really tiny part of it I
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
um that the money moves from the general
 
02:36:27.530 --> 02:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
fund that's really all general fund
 
02:36:29.450 --> 02:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
money that the swept stays in the towns
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
but beyond that you kind of that that's
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
kind of the limits of my my knowledge of
 
02:36:36.770 --> 02:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism at the state level
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I know it's a funding
 
02:36:40.690 --> 02:36:40.700 align:start position:0%
mechanism yeah further questions
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
my question my pleasure
 
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
so in your example and I'm sure there
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
are others like this of the student
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking two AP courses and some online
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
and something else yeah
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
money from the EFA
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
Grant or funding that that student has
 
02:37:12.770 --> 02:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
going back to the public school for the
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
services the public schools providing
 
02:37:16.849 --> 02:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
yes they're building the families for
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
the classes and courses that they're
 
02:37:21.050 --> 02:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
taking in most cases some of them are
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
letting the families do some things like
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
sports because their local taxpayers so
 
02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
I've heard both some families are paying
 
02:37:30.050 --> 02:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
the schools and they're billing them
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
some schools are allowing families to do
 
02:37:34.570 --> 02:37:34.580 align:start position:0%
things because they're local taxpayers
 
02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
when you have the expenses you'll see
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
some of the public schools and what
 
02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
they're receiving like for example
 
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's a student full-time at bath
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
Village School and there's a student
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
full time at Souhegan High School and
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
there's a student full-time at somehegan
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
Middle School Amherst Middle School is
 
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
the name of it at souhegan's the high
 
02:37:54.050 --> 02:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
school but some families are choosing
 
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
other Public Schools full-time and some
 
02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
of them are choosing classes and courses
 
02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
and the public schools have signed up as
 
02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
providers and are billing them
 
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't otherwise right
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
well they're getting the adequacy
 
02:38:07.969 --> 02:38:07.979 align:start position:0%
because remember the EFA has the step
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
down so they still get the adequacy in
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
the first year and 100 because they're
 
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
paid a year in arrears then they get 50
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
then they get 25 when a kid chooses the
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account but then we're
 
02:38:21.650 --> 02:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
also paying them
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
yeah so they're getting it twice really
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up is this fun okay we have fun
 
02:38:26.399 --> 02:38:27.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up is this fun okay we have fun
now

02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:29.450 align:start position:0%
now
so

02:38:29.450 --> 02:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's at the discretion of
 
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
the school district so I think they
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
should build for the funding I think
 
02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
they should Bill yes no regulation is
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
that correct it's not required I don't
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
know I think it should be maybe required
 
02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
because the dual enrollment law for
 
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers really doesn't apply to
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
these students because remember they're
 
02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
not homeschoolers anymore there's a
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
separate part of the the compulsory
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
attendance law they become an education
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
Freedom account student
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
I think the districts locally have the
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
discretion of whether they want to do it
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
or not but again now you're in the
 
02:39:07.730 --> 02:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
public school law realm and I just don't
 
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
have enough information to answer the
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
question but I think the families seem
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
happy to pay it if the public school is
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
billing them for a class or course or if
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're choosing an out of District
 
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
school then they're billing them the
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
tuition amount you know like for example
 
02:39:25.969 --> 02:39:25.979 align:start position:0%
that the tuition at to go to Souhegan
 
02:39:28.969 --> 02:39:28.979 align:start position:0%
High School was 25 000 and the family
 
02:39:31.130 --> 02:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
was using the education Freedom account
 
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
and a scholarship to pay for it both
 
02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
and so I think they in most cases will
 
02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
build the families unless they are
 
02:39:40.849 --> 02:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
thinking about this perhaps dual
 
02:39:43.309 --> 02:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment law but I don't know enough
 
02:39:45.469 --> 02:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
about it to really the school
 
02:39:47.929 --> 02:39:47.939 align:start position:0%
administrators know more and they're the
 
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
ones that have been telling me what the
 
02:39:52.010 --> 02:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
families should pay and then giving the
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
families the documentation right now
 
02:39:56.030 --> 02:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're getting way into the way up sorry
 
02:39:58.730 --> 02:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
this is fun stuff back here
 
02:40:00.410 --> 02:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna allow one more I have
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
another person who wants to speak here
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
today too and look at the clock folks
 
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to go right through without
 
02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:07.790 align:start position:0%
we're going to go right through without
lunch

02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.210 --> 02:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering how you come up with
 
02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
income levels whether it's earned income
 
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
um because we don't have a that's a
 
02:40:20.330 --> 02:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
great we don't have an income tax here
 
02:40:22.010 --> 02:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
so that's the government doesn't take
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
that yeah so how do you do the same as
 
02:40:26.690 --> 02:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
the federal uh free reduced lunch it's
 
02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
household income so it's not only your
 
02:40:31.969 --> 02:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
W-2 income that you earn it's also if
 
02:40:34.490 --> 02:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
you have food stamps or you have housing
 
02:40:37.370 --> 02:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
subsidy or you have child support or you
 
02:40:39.710 --> 02:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
have social security income so household
 
02:40:42.170 --> 02:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
income is everyone in the household and
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
to be honest that's married or not the
 
02:40:45.889 --> 02:40:45.899 align:start position:0%
way they look at that so we're
 
02:40:48.770 --> 02:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
collecting all that documentation from a
 
02:40:50.750 --> 02:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
whole household to come up with this
 
02:40:53.090 --> 02:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
income and that's the same way that the
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
federal government says to do the free
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch program
 
02:40:57.889 --> 02:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the questions to you
 
02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
know we're going to close the questions
 
02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
right now if you have a question to ask
 
02:41:06.650 --> 02:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
ask it after the we could take one more
 
02:41:08.210 --> 02:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
yeah no we're not going to go there
 
02:41:10.250 --> 02:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Kate all right bye

02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
as someone who went to a private school
 
02:41:37.130 --> 02:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
growing up my parents never take
 
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of any taxes
 
02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
my parents never asked for any help
 
02:41:46.429 --> 02:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
it was their decision to send me a
 
02:41:48.830 --> 02:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
private school it was their money paying
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
for a private school
 
02:41:52.730 --> 02:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
we never take money away from the public
 
02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:54.349 align:start position:0%
we never take money away from the public
school

02:41:54.349 --> 02:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
for me this has taken money with
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
students that they really need the
 
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
public education
 
02:42:04.370 --> 02:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
I keep hearing this is gray this is for
 
02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
underrepresented students
 
02:42:09.770 --> 02:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
believe me
 
02:42:12.429 --> 02:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
I'm part of one of those
 
02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
underrepresented communities
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't see these
 
02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
voucher bills or anything like this is
 
02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
helping my community
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
I want to know how many days private
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools or any of this identity that
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
they say and that they providing
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
amazing education for students on
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're coming from an underrepresented
 
02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
communities they care about the students
 
02:42:42.490 --> 02:42:42.500 align:start position:0%
where English is a second language
 
02:42:45.230 --> 02:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
I want to know how many others private
 
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
schools that have a program that can
 
02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
help students with different religion
 
02:42:49.859 --> 02:42:51.830 align:start position:0%
help students with different religion
beliefs

02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
I want to know if these private schools
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
they can tell us
 
02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
what programs that there are in public
 
02:43:04.969 --> 02:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
school for kids with a special need
 
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
they can provide them I want to know how
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:14.510 --> 02:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
they're not really taken in students
 
02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:16.849 align:start position:0%
they're not really taken in students
because

02:43:16.849 --> 02:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:19.370 --> 02:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
there are either disabled
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
are they coming from underrepresented
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
communities they are afraid to
 
02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:25.550 align:start position:0%
communities they are afraid to
um

02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
people coming from communities with
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
violence and it's you know uh
 
02:43:34.849 --> 02:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
it's under communities
 
02:43:37.309 --> 02:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
none of these people saying you know
 
02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
exactly how the money is being used
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
how many of the students that went and
 
02:43:45.770 --> 02:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
took the money for the abortion money
 
02:43:48.349 --> 02:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
the parents decided that private school
 
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't their thing and they sent the
 
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
kids back to the public school
 
02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
so they took the money from the voucher
 
02:43:56.809 --> 02:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
now the kids going back to the public
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
school but that founding is not there
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
for public school in my own district and
 
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
offer a public school they have a lot of
 
02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
projects that they need to be done
 
02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
but the schools don't have the funding
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
we have a student that they can even get
 
02:44:12.359 --> 02:44:14.030 align:start position:0%
we have a student that they can even get
lunches

02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
lunches
 
02:44:16.490 --> 02:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
but we keep taking money away from the
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
public school when the public school
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
should be funded
 
02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
we need to remind ourselves that the a
 
02:44:26.809 --> 02:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
lot of kids don't qualify for going to
 
02:44:28.969 --> 02:44:28.979 align:start position:0%
these private schools let their parents
 
02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
who have enough money to send the kids
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
to private school send them to private
 
02:44:36.170 --> 02:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
school but do not use my taxpayers money
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
the people in my community to pay for
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
your private school because that's what
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
you want to do and reliably speakers
 
02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
here I heard them that they they either
 
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
represented private schools
 
02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
or they're represented and someone or
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
the group that um a second advantage of
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
this let's be honest
 
02:44:57.710 --> 02:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
listen to the parents who cannot afford
 
02:44:59.450 --> 02:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
it to send their kids to private schools
 
02:45:02.330 --> 02:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
listen to the teachers they have to
 
02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
spend their own money to buy
 
02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and the private and the public school
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
enough is enough we're giving enough
 
02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
money away already it's time for us to
 
02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
give it back to the public school and
 
02:45:23.690 --> 02:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
stop taking away from the public school
 
02:45:25.550 --> 02:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
kids dessert
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
to have public education and teachers
 
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
deserve to have what they need to teach
 
02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I will take
 
02:45:37.610 --> 02:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:45:41.809 --> 02:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher
 
02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
testimony we've we've just heard
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
I think strong insinuation that some
 
02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
programs or some schools that are
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
involved with education Freedom accounts
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
maybe discriminating against uh English
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
as a second language Learners or against
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
minority students and I'd just like to
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
ask do you have any do you have any
 
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
evidence or data either anecdotal or
 
02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
data that that would support that with
 
02:46:12.530 --> 02:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
all my respect that I say I would love
 
02:46:16.429 --> 02:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
to see information I would love to see a
 
02:46:16.439 --> 02:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
to see information I would love to see a
report

02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:46:22.010 --> 02:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
what exactly did they do to really work
 
02:46:23.929 --> 02:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
for the people on the representative
 
02:46:26.270 --> 02:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
because I heard them saying that that
 
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
this Federal account is to work with the
 
02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
underrepresented community that's why I
 
02:46:33.170 --> 02:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
would love to see a report exactly what
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
are they doing for people for they
 
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
underrepresented communities and people
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
who English or other issues as you know
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
is secondary necessary I would love to
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
see that and that's what I'm asking for
 
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:49.010 --> 02:46:49.020 align:start position:0%

hearing and we're going to break for
 
02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:56.510 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're going to break for
lunch

02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%

and we will pick up the rest of the
 
02:47:00.650 --> 02:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
docket today when we come back at the
 
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
hey I'll tell you one thing Kate is
 
02:47:17.809 --> 02:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
undermining Frank
 
02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
and we got you know they should have
 
02:47:20.460 --> 02:59:59.150 align:start position:0%
and we got you know they should have
been

02:59:59.150 --> 02:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:59.160 --> 03:36:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:20.090 --> 03:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I do have a pink
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
card up there on the table somewhere uh
 
03:36:24.889 --> 03:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Rick Ladd I
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
come from Haverhill I Graft in five I'm
 
03:36:30.769 --> 03:36:30.779 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce 365 relative to
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide facility condition assessment
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
um this bill is one of three which uh
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
one will be going directly to finance
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
the other two we're going to have in
 
03:36:46.370 --> 03:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
committee here the ultimate goal of this
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
committee we will be looking at the
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
entire process for school building aid
 
03:36:53.030 --> 03:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
from the application process and all
 
03:36:56.030 --> 03:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
procedures associated with it right
 
03:36:59.450 --> 03:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
through the awarding of Grants so we've
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
got we have another bill coming at 452
 
03:37:04.370 --> 03:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's not this bill but this is comes
 
03:37:07.429 --> 03:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
out of the same section of law as all
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
the others so the intent of this bill
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
was to then support the the 10-year plan
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
which we currently have and I'll explain
 
03:37:17.450 --> 03:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
that in a moment but it's in the same
 
03:37:19.790 --> 03:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
sectional law as others so this might be
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
something that we incorporate into the
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
other Bill too if we're going to do a
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
healthy good study on school building
 
03:37:28.190 --> 03:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
Aid this year this may be something
 
03:37:30.050 --> 03:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
which we merged several bills together
 
03:37:33.889 --> 03:37:33.899 align:start position:0%
so with it I'll go ahead and start
 
03:37:36.110 --> 03:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
as it says right there in the paper it
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
but the purpose ability it's in support
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year school facilities plan we
 
03:37:43.550 --> 03:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh in last session put forward
 
03:37:46.610 --> 03:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
legislation where like we have a 10-year
 
03:37:50.330 --> 03:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
plan for a build uh a school uh highways
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
and roads and bridges we're looking at
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
the same issue here associated with our
 
03:37:57.190 --> 03:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
school facilities
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
we have a number of buildings which are
 
03:38:01.729 --> 03:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
needed help and I'll get into the
 
03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
specifics on that and we'll Biff here
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
um but going on through that top part
 
03:38:09.790 --> 03:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
districts are encouraged to submit uh
 
03:38:13.010 --> 03:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
projected long-range Capital needs to
 
03:38:14.450 --> 03:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
include the identification School
 
03:38:16.510 --> 03:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
renovation and construction goals
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
Associated projected expenditures and
 
03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
procedures to accomplish stated needs
 
03:38:25.250 --> 03:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
purpose of the whole thing is so that
 
03:38:26.929 --> 03:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
the state department or the Department
 
03:38:28.910 --> 03:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
of Education and the State Board of
 
03:38:31.190 --> 03:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
Education including in the legislature
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
which has to appropriate dollars in
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
support of school building Aid each
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
biennium and we have the two years which
 
03:38:39.889 --> 03:38:39.899 align:start position:0%
we support currently about 50 million
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
dollars of which you heard the other day
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
over at doe that we're actually funding
 
03:38:46.910 --> 03:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
half that for new renovation our
 
03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
renovation and new construction the rest
 
03:38:50.510 --> 03:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
is going off to pay our debt what we
 
03:38:51.710 --> 03:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
call the tail
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have the tail gone in
 
03:38:57.050 --> 03:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
year 2040s when we finished the last
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
payment on that 540 million dollars this
 
03:39:02.929 --> 03:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
state was in debt for back 10 years ago
 
03:39:06.530 --> 03:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
or actually 12 years ago and and as a
 
03:39:08.690 --> 03:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
result of that debt we've just come out
 
03:39:11.450 --> 03:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year moratorium which is
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
actually just compounded our school
 
03:39:16.849 --> 03:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
building aid program as far as the
 
03:39:18.530 --> 03:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
school districts are concerned with
 
03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
buildings that are just hard to maintain
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
and keep up there's an underlying
 
03:39:25.190 --> 03:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
portion at the top of that paper I just
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
handed out to you
 
03:39:28.610 --> 03:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
I thought it would be interesting for
 
03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
you to see how this whole project School
 
03:39:36.410 --> 03:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:39.170 --> 03:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
the success of our whole system depends
 
03:39:41.809 --> 03:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
as much on a thorough reform in the
 
03:39:44.570 --> 03:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
construction and care of schoolhouses as
 
03:39:46.729 --> 03:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
upon any other single circumstance
 
03:39:46.739 --> 03:39:48.469 align:start position:0%
upon any other single circumstance
whatever

03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:39:51.050 --> 03:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
the commissioner common schools for the
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and the
 
03:39:55.370 --> 03:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
presentation to the legislature back in
 
03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
June 1847 hadn't changed much
 
03:40:03.170 --> 03:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
I consider school buildings as really a
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
fourth leg of the stool in terms of our
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we're providing an
 
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
education which is necessary for kids to
 
03:40:15.050 --> 03:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
meet our kids students to meet the
 
03:40:16.969 --> 03:40:16.979 align:start position:0%
post-secondary needs or get on the
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
career pathways
 
03:40:21.650 --> 03:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
and without good school building school
 
03:40:23.090 --> 03:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
buildings we're not going to have the
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
facilities to do some things which we
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
need to do to stay up where we are with
 
03:40:29.690 --> 03:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
our Workforce demands
 
03:40:32.090 --> 03:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
going down and jumping I'll come back to
 
03:40:34.190 --> 03:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid Authority School
 
03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:36.779 align:start position:0%
Authority uh in a minute when I explain
 
03:40:38.690 --> 03:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
what that organization is and what it
 
03:40:38.700 --> 03:40:39.530 align:start position:0%
what that organization is and what it
does

03:40:39.530 --> 03:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
why is there a need for school building
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
Aid look at some of the bullets that we
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
have there evidence 50 of our school
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
buildings in New Hampshire are over 60
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
years old
 
03:40:54.170 --> 03:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
six percent were built prior to 1900.
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
26 percent built prior to 1950.
 
03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
seven schools are over 68 years old have
 
03:41:04.370 --> 03:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
not had a major renovation more than 50
 
03:41:06.650 --> 03:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
years a major renovation
 
03:41:08.330 --> 03:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about in some law
 
03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
schools which they may have corrected
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
with Esser monies HVAC you've been in
 
03:41:14.690 --> 03:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
schools where you hear the radiators
 
03:41:16.849 --> 03:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
they're banging and clunking away as
 
03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
they're exchanging air going outside and
 
03:41:20.750 --> 03:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
we have to change the filters in those
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
because they're all independent of and
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
run alone and teachers oftentimes who
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
put I did as a teacher kids clothes were
 
03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
wet after recess you put them in all
 
03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
your smelling in the classroom is
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
mittens and gloves and hats and coats
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
that are wet
 
03:41:42.190 --> 03:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh going on down here 196 schools 60
 
03:41:45.469 --> 03:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
originally built 50 plus years ago
 
03:41:48.170 --> 03:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
15 percent of schools are using portable
 
03:41:50.570 --> 03:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
classrooms we have several of those
 
03:41:52.010 --> 03:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
which we're using up in Haverhill where
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
I am right now where we have preschool
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
program in and a library in it and so we
 
03:41:59.570 --> 03:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
have portable classrooms start and
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
they're not the most ideal situation for
 
03:42:01.620 --> 03:42:03.769 align:start position:0%
they're not the most ideal situation for
instruction

03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh numerous HVAC systems when this was
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
compiled a couple years back perhaps
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
some of that has been changed now with
 
03:42:13.450 --> 03:42:13.460 align:start position:0%
the Esser money but as rated by
 
03:42:15.170 --> 03:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
administrators when they look into
 
03:42:17.809 --> 03:42:17.819 align:start position:0%
systems at best they were Fair most were
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
poor and many were in need of
 
03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:21.469 align:start position:0%
poor and many were in need of
replacement

03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
we've gone through as I said before a
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
10-year uh building Aid moratorium
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
moratorium new construction Revolution
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
projects funds minimal due to State debt
 
03:42:34.849 --> 03:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
tail okay so in order to address these
 
03:42:34.859 --> 03:42:35.870 align:start position:0%
tail okay so in order to address these
issues

03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
we came out of the moratorium several
 
03:42:40.610 --> 03:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
years back and we were able with 18
 
03:42:42.410 --> 03:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars to fund three small
 
03:42:42.420 --> 03:42:44.090 align:start position:0%
million dollars to fund three small
projects

03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
projects
 
03:42:45.969 --> 03:42:45.979 align:start position:0%
didn't go very far
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
did help Romney it did help behavioral
 
03:42:50.809 --> 03:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
and several others but that was about
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
the extent of it
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
um education learning associated with
 
03:42:56.570 --> 03:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
school facilities why are school
 
03:42:58.849 --> 03:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
facilities important let's look at it
 
03:43:01.969 --> 03:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
right students in poor buildings needing
 
03:43:04.490 --> 03:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
significant Renovations or upgrades form
 
03:43:06.349 --> 03:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
less well than students in functional
 
03:43:06.359 --> 03:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
less well than students in functional
buildings

03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
03:43:10.370 --> 03:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
I think you could identify that
 
03:43:12.769 --> 03:43:12.779 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden with the elementary
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
school you had up there in Maryland
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
Research indicates a student in poor
 
03:43:20.690 --> 03:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
building score five to ten percentile
 
03:43:22.969 --> 03:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
points below students in functional
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
facilities there is a correlation there
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
is a relationship where if you don't
 
03:43:30.170 --> 03:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
have a chemistry lab if you don't have
 
03:43:31.849 --> 03:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
proper facilities for special education
 
03:43:33.650 --> 03:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the conference room
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
space you can go on with all this list
 
03:43:38.570 --> 03:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
if the classrooms are old and don't have
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
the needs the technology within you are
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to compete against
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
some of the newer schools which have all
 
03:43:49.610 --> 03:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
that inclusive and and modern media
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
centers Etc
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
Research indicates that students as that
 
03:43:56.570 --> 03:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
student in poor buildings score five ten
 
03:43:58.370 --> 03:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
percentile points below students and
 
03:43:59.809 --> 03:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
functional facilities
 
03:44:01.790 --> 03:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
difference in achievement scores can be
 
03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
as high as 17 percentile points
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
older buildings here are some of the
 
03:44:08.809 --> 03:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
concerns we're dealing with control a
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
thermal environment control the
 
03:44:13.490 --> 03:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
environment it's you can go into places
 
03:44:15.530 --> 03:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
you find a steaming hot in one room you
 
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
go next door it's like Thule Greenland
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
and coal acceptable lighting we're
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
trying to teach we should be trying to
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
teach manuscript at least in schools and
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
you go in an Elementary classroom and
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
how many times is a kid seeing their
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
shadow on the paper
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
um it's it's inappropriate
 
03:44:38.570 --> 03:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult for many many
 
03:44:38.580 --> 03:44:39.950 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult for many many
students

03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:44:41.570 --> 03:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do is counter
 
03:44:43.190 --> 03:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
that with the type of lighting we put in
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
but if you mix and Max lighting you can
 
03:44:47.150 --> 03:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
have worse conditions as a study in
 
03:44:48.889 --> 03:44:48.899 align:start position:0%
Vermont and that it is just 10 years ago
 
03:44:51.889 --> 03:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
then by just leaving them alone
 
03:44:53.809 --> 03:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
acoustical control
 
03:44:55.370 --> 03:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
how many times can hear what's going on
 
03:44:57.530 --> 03:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
in the classroom right beside you
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
or how can you hear you hear the band
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
practicing in what was once and then in
 
03:45:04.429 --> 03:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
a classroom and is bouncing off through
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
the school
 
03:45:09.170 --> 03:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
um functional equipment in the rooms
 
03:45:09.180 --> 03:45:10.309 align:start position:0%
um functional equipment in the rooms
themselves

03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:45:13.070 --> 03:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh lab space appropriate space nurses
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
science cafeteria storage gym conference
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
room especially I was just listening a
 
03:45:19.130 --> 03:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
couple last night I could go on and that
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
list could be a running list of
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
functional spaces necessary
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
um to compound the issue most of the
 
03:45:28.190 --> 03:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
older schools and those in poor
 
03:45:31.070 --> 03:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
conditions are located in areas of
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
Greater poverty
 
03:45:35.210 --> 03:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
other words we've had some schools that
 
03:45:38.269 --> 03:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
built during the moratorium period but
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
they came from communities which could
 
03:45:41.690 --> 03:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
have they could fund their own bonds
 
03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
they could do it the poor communities
 
03:45:45.769 --> 03:45:45.779 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it so you're left with these
 
03:45:45.779 --> 03:45:47.150 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it so you're left with these
buildings

03:45:47.150 --> 03:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
03:45:49.849 --> 03:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
the reason why Romney got their uh
 
03:45:51.769 --> 03:45:51.779 align:start position:0%
upgrade for elementary school here two
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
years ago you couldn't even get in the
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
building if you're in a wheelchair you
 
03:45:59.210 --> 03:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
had to go up four steps to get into the
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
building it was built up higher you
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't access the second floor of the
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
snow elevator so they had ensure all the
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
Middle School classes were down lower
 
03:46:09.229 --> 03:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
and where the kids were rotating between
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
classrooms and I don't know how John Ann
 
03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
did it but she's a wonderful principal
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
and she managed it but they did get that
 
03:46:15.359 --> 03:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
and she managed it but they did get that
Grant

03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.760 --> 03:46:19.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:46:19.250 --> 03:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a strong link between school
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid and the delivery of an
 
03:46:25.610 --> 03:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
adequate education there is there's a
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
link we've also know we've seen that in
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative Myler saw that when he
 
03:46:32.690 --> 03:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
chaired the commission for the task
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
force for funding and I did a a research
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
paper on that as well and we do know
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the 13 cities in
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
this state two are basically co-step
 
03:46:47.809 --> 03:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
proficient the others are not and so
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
this and they are communities which
 
03:46:51.410 --> 03:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
cannot raise some of that dollars
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester being one
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh so there's a number of schools which
 
03:46:59.330 --> 03:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to raise the
 
03:47:02.090 --> 03:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
dollars necessary and and the fiscal
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
capacity to variate is has not done what
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
it should do and there is a that
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
contributes to our achievement in
 
03:47:08.640 --> 03:47:10.370 align:start position:0%
contributes to our achievement in
schools

03:47:10.370 --> 03:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of the current building
 
03:47:14.090 --> 03:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
application and procedures needed and
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
that need consideration now we're
 
03:47:18.050 --> 03:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
getting down this 10-year plan why do we
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
have a 10-year plan or need a 10-year
 
03:47:19.979 --> 03:47:21.469 align:start position:0%
have a 10-year plan or need a 10-year
plan

03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:47:23.150 --> 03:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the numbers in front of
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
me but we looked the other day over at
 
03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
uh doe and or right here with Amy Clark
 
03:47:31.010 --> 03:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
who gave us a presentation on those 17
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
schools that have applied for building a
 
03:47:33.120 --> 03:47:34.210 align:start position:0%
schools that have applied for building a
construction

03:47:34.210 --> 03:47:34.220 align:start position:0%
construction
 
03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
and we've received over 500 some odd
 
03:47:39.650 --> 03:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars in requests the state
 
03:47:42.290 --> 03:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
share 30 to 60 percent would be
 
03:47:44.570 --> 03:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 200 plus thousand two
 
03:47:46.849 --> 03:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars
 
03:47:48.290 --> 03:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
um there's an order which we have to do
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
when when we get those rank order sheets
 
03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Education there's
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
a process which we've gone through as a
 
03:47:59.870 --> 03:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
state to determine which ones have the
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
highest need
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
and they did that evidently with the
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
schools which are receiving it are
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
proposed to receive it in this biennium
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
Rochester then came Colebrook and then
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
came Monadnock elementary schools but
 
03:48:17.570 --> 03:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
below that you see Concord coming on
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
with a project of 70 million dollars
 
03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:20.929 align:start position:0%
with a project of 70 million dollars
worth

03:48:20.929 --> 03:48:20.939 align:start position:0%
worth
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
now if we're funding schools at 50
 
03:48:24.769 --> 03:48:24.779 align:start position:0%
million bucks we're not ever going to
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
get near that need to help conquered out
 
03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
or some of these other high schools
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
which are now going well over three
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
digits in terms of millions of dollars
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
so we we developed and we're trying to
 
03:48:38.090 --> 03:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
get a handle on this with a 10-year plan
 
03:48:40.190 --> 03:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
which we had several years ago we're
 
03:48:41.929 --> 03:48:41.939 align:start position:0%
trying to get a better handle so we can
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
prioritize and plan where we're going
 
03:48:47.210 --> 03:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
the idea back then I believe the bill
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
was if I'm correct it was HP 214 I
 
03:48:53.090 --> 03:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
believe at that point in time we're
 
03:48:55.490 --> 03:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
trying to develop a process in which we
 
03:48:58.090 --> 03:48:58.100 align:start position:0%
could send Engineers policy people
 
03:49:02.690 --> 03:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
Architects out on teams to inspect all
 
03:49:05.330 --> 03:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
our facilities and so we would be
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
inspecting all these facilities
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
based upon the same criteria these
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
engineers and policy people would be
 
03:49:15.710 --> 03:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
doing it cleared out this how this body
 
03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:17.570 align:start position:0%
doing it cleared out this how this body
unanimously

03:49:17.570 --> 03:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
it got to house finance and it went
 
03:49:23.570 --> 03:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
downhill fast
 
03:49:25.729 --> 03:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
the reason why is that we were looking
 
03:49:27.650 --> 03:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
at how we were going to fund that and
 
03:49:30.110 --> 03:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
working with doe we determined it was
 
03:49:32.330 --> 03:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
going to cost approximately 3.3 million
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars for these teams to go out and
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
give us this information back
 
03:49:39.290 --> 03:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
we were going to take approximately 1.3
 
03:49:41.929 --> 03:49:41.939 align:start position:0%
million of that from the public school
 
03:49:43.729 --> 03:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund which was carry over
 
03:49:49.130 --> 03:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
its uh monies which we don't lose uh so
 
03:49:50.450 --> 03:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
we would have had that and we had
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
appropriated another two million dollars
 
03:49:53.090 --> 03:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
which we were going to use for electric
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
buses and which we have not used for
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
that we were going to use it for this
 
03:49:58.729 --> 03:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
team and we would have gone out and done
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
that uh however that two million dollars
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
now and not 1.3 have been used for
 
03:50:05.870 --> 03:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
security in our schools which is equally
 
03:50:08.330 --> 03:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
as important a concern
 
03:50:11.269 --> 03:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
with the public school safety uh
 
03:50:11.279 --> 03:50:12.590 align:start position:0%
with the public school safety uh
Commission

03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
so what we want to do is we want to try
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
and get from districts report so what
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be your needs as we do with
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
highways and bridges and Roads
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
and have a 10-year plan so we can better
 
03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
understand what's out there and in
 
03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
conjunction with our process for
 
03:50:35.090 --> 03:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
receiving applications and I wrote a few
 
03:50:37.370 --> 03:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
bullets last night late probably around
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
11 30. so I probably missed something
 
03:50:41.690 --> 03:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
here aspects of current building
 
03:50:43.849 --> 03:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
application procedures needing
 
03:50:46.429 --> 03:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
consideration department and legislative
 
03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
planning prioritization anticipated
 
03:50:51.050 --> 03:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
Capital appropriation sources of revenue
 
03:50:53.330 --> 03:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
relative School building Aid
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
those are things which we have to tackle
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
we will with the bill which we kind of
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
coming in but one of the things we want
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
to look at and we've heard it spoken to
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit when we talk about another
 
03:51:05.330 --> 03:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
topic this morning where does the money
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
for school building Aid come from
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
can we possibly have some of that
 
03:51:12.530 --> 03:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
allocated out of the education trust
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
fund can we set up another way of
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the money is going to be
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
there so that when we can have these
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
10-year plans we can actually have money
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
to support where we're going
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
um application timelines if you are a
 
03:51:29.389 --> 03:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools or School
 
03:51:31.250 --> 03:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
Board looking at building you know it's
 
03:51:34.670 --> 03:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
a real long process to try to even think
 
03:51:36.650 --> 03:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
you're going to get building Aid in the
 
03:51:38.929 --> 03:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
state and if you're a poor District like
 
03:51:41.150 --> 03:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
the one I come from and I would say
 
03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
probably also for the Berlin School
 
03:51:45.889 --> 03:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
District you may get you may get 60
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
percent from the state but at least a
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
huge chunk for a district that's a a
 
03:51:52.849 --> 03:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
poor town
 
03:51:55.130 --> 03:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
so the timeline first thing that
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
department education is going to ask of
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
us to do is submit a letter of intent
 
03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
your letter of intent has to be and when
 
03:52:04.849 --> 03:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
has to be in there before July 1 but
 
03:52:08.450 --> 03:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
between July 1 and January 15th we have
 
03:52:10.370 --> 03:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
to take all the applications that have
 
03:52:13.190 --> 03:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
come forward and by January 15th come
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
out and have this prioritized by this
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
state uh Board of Education
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's virtually very difficult almost
 
03:52:24.349 --> 03:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
impossible to do accurately seeing that
 
03:52:26.650 --> 03:52:26.660 align:start position:0%
the process starts the building
 
03:52:29.330 --> 03:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
applications are received by Amy Clark
 
03:52:32.210 --> 03:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
over doe she looks them over the
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
department looks them over
 
03:52:37.250 --> 03:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
they put them in a rank order they send
 
03:52:39.050 --> 03:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
that on the school building authority
 
03:52:41.330 --> 03:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
now the school building authority when
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
that was established back in
 
03:52:48.170 --> 03:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
1997 I believe excuse me 1961
 
03:52:51.170 --> 03:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
here's what it was set up for by the um
 
03:52:53.690 --> 03:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
Committee on Public Schools structure uh
 
03:52:56.150 --> 03:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
districts and super supervisory unions
 
03:52:58.849 --> 03:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
back in 1691. it's recommended a state
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
school building of Aid Authority be
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
established to provide financial
 
03:53:02.760 --> 03:53:04.370 align:start position:0%
established to provide financial
assistance

03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
standard plans and insurance for schools
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
and school districts of New Hampshire
 
03:53:11.389 --> 03:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
looking at bonding capacity of these
 
03:53:13.130 --> 03:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
districts looking the bonding capacity
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the the state in terms of supporting
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
these Aid grants
 
03:53:21.290 --> 03:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
so we do send right now as a check the
 
03:53:23.330 --> 03:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
criteria based on criteria which we've
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
gone through and rated all the
 
03:53:26.690 --> 03:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
applications on I won't go in that
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
criteria the length of the list is very
 
03:53:31.330 --> 03:53:31.340 align:start position:0%
long everything from demographics to
 
03:53:35.330 --> 03:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
size of class and special services all
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
that's incorporated into this
 
03:53:41.630 --> 03:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
and that is submitted on to the school
 
03:53:44.269 --> 03:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
building authority they check it out to
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
see if it gels with you know their
 
03:53:49.550 --> 03:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
perspective perception of this rank
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
order gels with that came from Doe
 
03:53:55.070 --> 03:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh there
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
being asked to do a job
 
03:54:00.170 --> 03:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
which actually that group was never set
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
up to do
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
you can see that on the back side there
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
who is a member of that particular group
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer Commission of
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
Education the State Fire Marshal and
 
03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
three others appointed by the governor
 
03:54:16.130 --> 03:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
one with education background one with
 
03:54:18.469 --> 03:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
Finance background one with as a
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
construction or engineer
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
they look at this process and within a
 
03:54:25.610 --> 03:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
period of several weeks have to come out
 
03:54:28.370 --> 03:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
with a conclusion the rancor looks good
 
03:54:30.950 --> 03:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you can't do it they can't get site
 
03:54:33.349 --> 03:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
visitations so what we're gonna have to
 
03:54:34.969 --> 03:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
do with our timeline we're gonna have to
 
03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
back that off at least by I would say at
 
03:54:40.429 --> 03:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
least by another six months out in
 
03:54:42.170 --> 03:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
probably farther than that with the
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
letter intent coming in and then getting
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
into the other aspects of what an
 
03:54:49.370 --> 03:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
applicant application entails
 
03:54:51.530 --> 03:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
and that is incumbent upon the school
 
03:54:53.689 --> 03:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
district to start doing that they have
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
to go out and get the schematic plans
 
03:54:58.370 --> 03:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
done and all that other done and hire an
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
architect hire an engineer come in and
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
give them a rough idea what they're
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
going to have but the other big issue is
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
so we come out in January 15th with hear
 
03:55:08.750 --> 03:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
so much money you're going to receive
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
School District
 
03:55:12.290 --> 03:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
now you have how much time before you
 
03:55:15.290 --> 03:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
can get that as a warrant article
 
03:55:17.330 --> 03:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
maybe a week or two
 
03:55:18.769 --> 03:55:18.779 align:start position:0%
because you've got to get it published
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
and then you're in trouble so here we
 
03:55:24.769 --> 03:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
are the process is is too condensed we
 
03:55:26.689 --> 03:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
need to strengthen that out we gotta
 
03:55:29.809 --> 03:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
talk about the capital a 10-year plan we
 
03:55:32.510 --> 03:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
gotta talk about all this so my
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion is right now that we look at
 
03:55:36.889 --> 03:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
this bill as a part of the subsequent
 
03:55:39.650 --> 03:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 452 which will be coming at us and
 
03:55:43.570 --> 03:55:43.580 align:start position:0%
we take and look at all our
 
03:55:47.150 --> 03:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
processes and procedures necessary from
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
get to go get to the end of the process
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
here so we can look at where these
 
03:55:55.370 --> 03:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming from and how we're
 
03:55:57.769 --> 03:55:57.779 align:start position:0%
going to receive applications a timeline
 
03:56:00.889 --> 03:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
and and assist these districts in trying
 
03:56:03.889 --> 03:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
to you know remediate this issue which
 
03:56:05.809 --> 03:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
they have out there we have too many old
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
buildings which are constricting what
 
03:56:11.090 --> 03:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're able to do in education yes we are
 
03:56:13.729 --> 03:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
a state that has many rural areas and
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
they have no options to you know they
 
03:56:18.769 --> 03:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
have to provide these Services even at a
 
03:56:20.090 --> 03:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
cost which they're not provided the
 
03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
money to do in order to be provide equal
 
03:56:24.650 --> 03:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
Services they have to have AP courses
 
03:56:24.660 --> 03:56:25.849 align:start position:0%
Services they have to have AP courses
too

03:56:25.849 --> 03:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
and they have to have the staff to do it
 
03:56:29.570 --> 03:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
so a lot of things we've got to look at
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'll close my I don't want to ramble on
 
03:56:34.010 --> 03:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
here too much more this is a huge topic
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's one which I'd really appreciated as
 
03:56:38.689 --> 03:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
the school administrator for years I
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
went through the building process in
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
Alaska and I can remember building the
 
03:56:44.210 --> 03:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
last building we did our high school
 
03:56:46.729 --> 03:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
back then about 20 years ago was over 90
 
03:56:48.530 --> 03:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
and um I compare where I was there to
 
03:56:54.650 --> 03:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
what I see here in this state
 
03:56:56.450 --> 03:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
they had an Olympic-sized swimming pool
 
03:56:58.969 --> 03:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
in it they had a theater with us as
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
could fit 600 people with an orchestra
 
03:57:04.250 --> 03:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
pit in the building they had a science
 
03:57:07.729 --> 03:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
wing math Wings vocational education in
 
03:57:10.809 --> 03:57:10.819 align:start position:0%
the school unbelievable they had a
 
03:57:14.870 --> 03:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
several football fields soccer fields
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
um all of it
 
03:57:19.370 --> 03:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
and and here I haven't seen it of course
 
03:57:21.170 --> 03:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's not part of school building Aid
 
03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
the all the Athletics is not you know
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
that representative Woodcock but the
 
03:57:27.769 --> 03:57:27.779 align:start position:0%
academic stuff is so we got to make sure
 
03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're hitting that properly thank you
 
03:57:30.650 --> 03:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:57:33.170 --> 03:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you a question of
 
03:57:34.969 --> 03:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
Representative miler
 
03:57:38.269 --> 03:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so if I understand
 
03:57:41.090 --> 03:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
is to identify as to provide these
 
03:57:45.290 --> 03:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
10-year plans that would give us some
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
idea of the status of buildings
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that it might then provide some
 
03:57:55.010 --> 03:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
impetus for additional state aid funding
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's part of it yes just so also we
 
03:57:59.809 --> 03:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
know for example you'll see a second
 
03:58:02.450 --> 03:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
sheet there that comes from the state of
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
Idaho is that attached to your sheet
 
03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:06.050 align:start position:0%
Idaho is that attached to your sheet
there

03:58:06.050 --> 03:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're having a similar problem out
 
03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
there they were getting these reports
 
03:58:11.689 --> 03:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
while we had these needs in our schools
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the people which are completing
 
03:58:15.469 --> 03:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
those reports happen to be the custodian
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the building or somebody that didn't
 
03:58:19.610 --> 03:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
have that expertise to know what was
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
behind that wall whether it's asbestos
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
behind the wall just like we're finding
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
over in Pleasant Street where doe is
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
03:58:29.929 --> 03:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
so what they're getting in from the
 
03:58:33.650 --> 03:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
schools was not necessarily enough to
 
03:58:36.290 --> 03:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
build these and prioritize the lists
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
which we need and I'm concerned that we
 
03:58:41.809 --> 03:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
need to have the capital Improvement
 
03:58:41.819 --> 03:58:43.750 align:start position:0%
need to have the capital Improvement
information

03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so we can better plan and
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
know these revenues are coming from and
 
03:58:51.769 --> 03:58:51.779 align:start position:0%
so we can't facilitate the needs of the
 
03:58:51.779 --> 03:58:52.929 align:start position:0%
so we can't facilitate the needs of the
districts

03:58:52.929 --> 03:58:52.939 align:start position:0%
districts
 
03:58:54.950 --> 03:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers a little bit about
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
it but that's part part of the issue
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
part of the issue we just gotta need
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
what's know what's out there
 
03:59:03.170 --> 03:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can get that in for the
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement program they do it
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
with roads and highways and bridges
 
03:59:09.889 --> 03:59:09.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
03:59:12.170 --> 03:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
um representative cascadden
 
03:59:14.450 --> 03:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you acting chair
 
03:59:18.170 --> 03:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
um my question is who who is building a
 
03:59:20.210 --> 03:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
no what entities
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
can apply for building Aid
 
03:59:26.210 --> 03:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
now who who is the building aid for
 
03:59:29.570 --> 03:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
is for our Public Schools thank you and
 
03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
but there you'll also see in one part of
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
the statue where it says a charter
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
school can receive 30 however that's why
 
03:59:37.969 --> 03:59:37.979 align:start position:0%
we have a bill coming up for
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
recodification because in another place
 
03:59:42.769 --> 03:59:42.779 align:start position:0%
you go into finance and it says the
 
03:59:45.830 --> 03:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
opposite okay so what we're seeing is
 
03:59:47.929 --> 03:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
that one section law says you can one
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
say the law says you can't what do you
 
03:59:52.610 --> 03:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
follow right and this is the confusion
 
03:59:54.530 --> 03:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
we have this is why I believe US
 
03:59:56.689 --> 03:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
Representative Hill to put that bill in
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
for re-codification that's a result of
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
folks attorneys over there and
 
04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
legislative Services saying it's time to
 
04:00:06.290 --> 04:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
really get this thing fixed and just to
 
04:00:08.290 --> 04:00:08.300 align:start position:0%
re-codify education
 
04:00:10.969 --> 04:00:10.979 align:start position:0%
laws I would say it's going to take to
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
do it properly a couple years
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for
 
04:00:20.689 --> 04:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
approaching this subject that's uh
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
very testy in the local areas
 
04:00:27.769 --> 04:00:27.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering I know the the
 
04:00:31.070 --> 04:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill is uh strongly urge rather than
 
04:00:33.769 --> 04:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
require or shall or would
 
04:00:33.779 --> 04:00:34.729 align:start position:0%
require or shall or would
um

04:00:34.729 --> 04:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:36.769 --> 04:00:36.779 align:start position:0%
how much is this going to cost local
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
districts money or do you think this is
 
04:00:40.969 --> 04:00:40.979 align:start position:0%
this is what they probably are going
 
04:00:40.979 --> 04:00:42.050 align:start position:0%
this is what they probably are going
through

04:00:42.050 --> 04:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis anyway with their own
 
04:00:47.450 --> 04:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
needs we see already in place the
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that's in statute the way
 
04:00:50.399 --> 04:00:51.410 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that's in statute the way
the

04:00:51.410 --> 04:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:53.689 --> 04:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
um the state is developing that 10-year
 
04:00:56.809 --> 04:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
plan is we have a department of one over
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
there at doe right now
 
04:01:01.010 --> 04:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's responsibility for other tasks
 
04:01:04.130 --> 04:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
other than School building Aid and they
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
are making the decision they're
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
prioritizing over internally
 
04:01:12.590 --> 04:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh we we have had to build 214 where we
 
04:01:15.229 --> 04:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
recognize the encourage recommend first
 
04:01:18.050 --> 04:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
do it we're going to do it we tried the
 
04:01:21.650 --> 04:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
do it side and we weren't provided the
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
funding the 3.3 million dollars which we
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
needed to do it would professional
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
people going out and doing site
 
04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
visitations so now it we know that there
 
04:01:32.750 --> 04:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
are a number of districts which are in
 
04:01:34.910 --> 04:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
the process of going after building Aid
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
right now that have hired architects
 
04:01:40.010 --> 04:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
and that's an expensive proposition my
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
District's doing that right now and yet
 
04:01:44.090 --> 04:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
you don't see them even listed on that
 
04:01:47.090 --> 04:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
list of 17. so some have this
 
04:01:49.130 --> 04:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
information it's not a mandatory thing
 
04:01:51.710 --> 04:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
they do this but I would think down the
 
04:01:54.050 --> 04:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
roadways when we have this list properly
 
04:01:56.330 --> 04:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
developed that will be the list that we
 
04:01:58.849 --> 04:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
start looking at in terms of rank
 
04:02:01.689 --> 04:02:01.699 align:start position:0%
ordering how we're going to facilitate
 
04:02:04.969 --> 04:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
our Revenue such we have in expending
 
04:02:08.450 --> 04:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
them out to help building Aid we've got
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
to have a better plan and place than we
 
04:02:12.769 --> 04:02:12.779 align:start position:0%
do now I recognize that in this there's
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
things that have to be tweaked that's
 
04:02:17.090 --> 04:02:17.100 align:start position:0%
why I say we need to hold on to this one
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
until we do 452 and do them both
 
04:02:22.370 --> 04:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and answer these
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
questions is a good question
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and we're we're
 
04:02:28.370 --> 04:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
going to have to really address this one
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
we tried last year we were unsuccessful
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Woodcock did
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
04:02:37.150 --> 04:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you
 
04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:02:39.300 --> 04:02:39.950 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
um

04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
similar to uh Tan's question I was
 
04:02:45.290 --> 04:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
looking at a similar thing and on the
 
04:02:49.250 --> 04:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
line in your uh revision or Edition uh
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
in 12 and 15 Rick you use the word a
 
04:02:56.330 --> 04:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
recommended wants and encourage once I
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
wonder why if it's going to be required
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan why wasn't that more
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
strong as representative sort of
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that shall or must
 
04:03:08.450 --> 04:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'm all for it but you know that's why
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
we need to work on all this uh
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
recommended is you're we're trying to
 
04:03:15.050 --> 04:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
stay away from that unfunded mandate
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay and that's the Crux of it
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
before represent yes Mr chairman thank
 
04:03:22.990 --> 04:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
you um
 
04:03:25.130 --> 04:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
I don't have a good handle on this whole
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
piece but a school uh payroll for
 
04:03:32.929 --> 04:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
instance so Conway that is not he's not
 
04:03:34.610 --> 04:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
looking at we will be on the way on the
 
04:03:37.849 --> 04:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
10-year plan we or I think copacetic and
 
04:03:40.130 --> 04:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
emergency hits and we lose a whole
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
building the whole roof the everything
 
04:03:46.250 --> 04:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
falls in how how does that uh then uh
 
04:03:48.410 --> 04:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
get approached there there is money for
 
04:03:51.170 --> 04:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
emergency projects in the state so if
 
04:03:52.849 --> 04:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
the roof or the Kenneth Middle School
 
04:03:55.010 --> 04:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
Falls in which you know your new high
 
04:03:57.050 --> 04:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
school is a pretty decent building
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
because I think it is the Beats
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
Woodsville well knew it was a decade
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
over go ahead oh a decade okay let's
 
04:04:05.809 --> 04:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
compare ages here uh yeah there you go
 
04:04:05.819 --> 04:04:07.090 align:start position:0%
compare ages here uh yeah there you go
yeah

04:04:07.090 --> 04:04:07.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay but there isn't right so that
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact this
 
04:04:15.889 --> 04:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
there is for example we had an issue in
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
Haverhill Middle School which is a
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
relatively new building it was built in
 
04:04:21.769 --> 04:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
the 1990s okay
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
and they had I couldn't believe what I
 
04:04:24.120 --> 04:04:24.889 align:start position:0%
and they had I couldn't believe what I
saw

04:04:24.889 --> 04:04:24.899 align:start position:0%
saw
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
the art room was downstairs this
 
04:04:26.880 --> 04:04:28.750 align:start position:0%
the art room was downstairs this
two-story

04:04:28.750 --> 04:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
two-story
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
our room is downstairs and then they
 
04:04:33.769 --> 04:04:33.779 align:start position:0%
vented the Kiln which is in the art room
 
04:04:35.689 --> 04:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
up the side of the building and into the
 
04:04:35.699 --> 04:04:37.250 align:start position:0%
up the side of the building and into the
Attic

04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
Attic
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
not more in about 20 years later the
 
04:04:41.150 --> 04:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
whole roof was rotten
 
04:04:43.130 --> 04:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
and everything holding the roof up is
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
04:04:47.450 --> 04:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
and so we had to spend one year with our
 
04:04:50.269 --> 04:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
students in the National Guard Armory
 
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
while we used emergency money coming
 
04:04:56.570 --> 04:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
from the state to help us fix that now
 
04:04:59.809 --> 04:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
that is as you may recall on school
 
04:05:01.969 --> 04:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
building Aid now
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
you have to have for projects of a
 
04:05:07.010 --> 04:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
certain size a clerk of the works that's
 
04:05:10.010 --> 04:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
bonded and knowledgeable as like an
 
04:05:12.410 --> 04:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
engineer before the clerk of the works
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
could have been your head custodian
 
04:05:17.809 --> 04:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
and you know change orders would come in
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
from the contractors and things got
 
04:05:22.729 --> 04:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
approved just like that and the price of
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
that building doubled immediately so we
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get a grip on where
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
we're going with this thank you thank
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%

um Mr Kirk do we have any further cards
 
04:05:42.349 --> 04:05:42.359 align:start position:0%

04:07:05.150 --> 04:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
from Stratford County District 10 which
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
is a town of Durham
 
04:07:06.720 --> 04:07:07.429 align:start position:0%
is a town of Durham
um

04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:09.650 --> 04:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
I did I've written testimonies the same
 
04:07:11.330 --> 04:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
as testimony I submitted through the web
 
04:07:13.010 --> 04:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
portal but uh
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
I figured I had to print up at least one
 
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
hard copy for myself so I know what I
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
said and also I haven't quite figured
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
out exactly where it is these things go
 
04:07:23.630 --> 04:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
or how we access them but it's it's a
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
new system so I'm it's a
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
The Spill probably looks very familiar
 
04:07:31.610 --> 04:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
to a lot of us and we had a very
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
identical Bill pretty much except for
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
the uh I think the effective date maybe
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we changed in 2020
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
right before the covid-19 emergency
 
04:07:43.370 --> 04:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
which is the subject of the other Bill
 
04:07:45.170 --> 04:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
is doing up in labor Earth but it worked
 
04:07:47.570 --> 04:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
out pretty good uh labor was right on
 
04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
time and you're a few minutes late and
 
04:07:50.929 --> 04:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
then my own committee Judiciary is way
 
04:07:52.729 --> 04:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
late so it's working out pretty good for
 
04:07:52.739 --> 04:07:53.389 align:start position:0%
late so it's working out pretty good for
me

04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
and this table the Senate during the
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
emergency and then that was similar to
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
another bill SB 196 which passed into
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
2019 but it was one of medievals vetoed
 
04:08:06.650 --> 04:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
by governor sununu in 2019.
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
so um and also mentioned in addition to
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
being a rep from Durham I'm also a
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
member of the vital uh
 
04:08:14.689 --> 04:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
the vital records privacy board and I
 
04:08:16.969 --> 04:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
see the chair of that board is uh
 
04:08:18.410 --> 04:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
attending the hearing whether she's
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
planning to speak or not I'm not sure
 
04:08:21.650 --> 04:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
but I hope I hope she does so I'm sure
 
04:08:23.330 --> 04:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
her comments will be much more valuable
 
04:08:26.090 --> 04:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
than mine it's
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult virtually impossible to
 
04:08:29.689 --> 04:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
schools to participate meaningfully
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
under surveys about drug use social
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
behavior public health and other
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
sensitive personal topics with the
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
exception of one survey
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
which I believe it's every two years
 
04:08:41.870 --> 04:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
like maybe it's misinformed but it's the
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
cdc's youth-rich behavior survey and the
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
reason they had a carve out for that one
 
04:08:46.969 --> 04:08:46.979 align:start position:0%
was because
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
we would have watched I think tens of
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
millions maybe a huge sum of money would
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
have been lost if we didn't participate
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
in that one so that was uh that's why
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's why there's a carve out of the
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
current law which by the way dates back
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
a little bit before 2019.
 
04:09:01.439 --> 04:09:02.809 align:start position:0%
a little bit before 2019.
um

04:09:02.809 --> 04:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
and uh a governor said when he vetoed
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
the bill of 2018 to decrease his
 
04:09:09.050 --> 04:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
personal parental involvement but that's
 
04:09:10.610 --> 04:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
not true I think these surveys increased
 
04:09:12.410 --> 04:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
parental involvement um
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
at the time of the minister the surveys
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
he raised important questions to
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
students wines and I found uh students
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
to take these questionnaires and just
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
like the standardized tests they tend to
 
04:09:27.050 --> 04:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
take them pretty seriously this raises
 
04:09:28.729 --> 04:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
questions what they can to do discuss at
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
home with their parents and also when we
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
analyze it we learn more about these
 
04:09:32.399 --> 04:09:33.650 align:start position:0%
analyze it we learn more about these
issues

04:09:33.650 --> 04:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:09:36.530 --> 04:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a lot of this data
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
qualifies us for federal and other
 
04:09:38.399 --> 04:09:40.010 align:start position:0%
qualifies us for federal and other
funding

04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:09:43.610 --> 04:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
so this would be back actually should be
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
back to the way the bills 2015 is when
 
04:09:47.929 --> 04:09:47.939 align:start position:0%
this whole RSA was first put in the
 
04:09:50.450 --> 04:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
books and we would schools would once
 
04:09:51.650 --> 04:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
again be able to participate in
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys and parents would
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
the parents would have to opt out of
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
each survey if they don't want their
 
04:09:59.150 --> 04:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
children to participate right now they
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
have to opt into every survey which
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
greatly reduces the participation and
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of work for the schools
 
04:10:06.650 --> 04:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
and the parents so the default is going
 
04:10:07.969 --> 04:10:07.979 align:start position:0%
to be for them to be allowed to
 
04:10:07.979 --> 04:10:09.530 align:start position:0%
to be for them to be allowed to
participate

04:10:09.530 --> 04:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
participate
 
04:10:11.150 --> 04:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a wealthy useful
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
information surveys in many cases those
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
surveys are prerequisite for Grants and
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
or eligibility participated programs and
 
04:10:17.760 --> 04:10:19.070 align:start position:0%
or eligibility participated programs and
uh

04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
got a paragraph here about the
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
legislative history I'll skip over that
 
04:10:22.739 --> 04:10:24.410 align:start position:0%
legislative history I'll skip over that
um

04:10:24.410 --> 04:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:27.530 --> 04:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the as I said the why the
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
reason that one survey was uh included
 
04:10:31.610 --> 04:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
just because the cost was
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of and there are many members
 
04:10:36.290 --> 04:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
of the legislature who want to opt out
 
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
of that one too but the cost would have
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
been would have lasted a huge hole in
 
04:10:44.090 --> 04:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
the uh in the uh in education funding so
 
04:10:45.650 --> 04:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and we've lost millions of dollars
 
04:10:48.530 --> 04:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
anyway just from uh the current law so
 
04:10:51.889 --> 04:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
and finally I'll say uh finally I'll say
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly uh I've learned a little
 
04:10:55.250 --> 04:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
bit more about this from the vital
 
04:10:56.929 --> 04:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
records privacy board even though that's
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
not really educational surveys per se
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
they're undertaken with very stringent
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
requirements so the federal government
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
has strict laws that govern all data
 
04:11:07.809 --> 04:11:07.819 align:start position:0%
collection by federally funded programs
 
04:11:09.769 --> 04:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
including those funded by what they call
 
04:11:11.450 --> 04:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
pass-through dollars
 
04:11:14.330 --> 04:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
and there's additional protections for
 
04:11:16.250 --> 04:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
vulnerable subpopulations which includes
 
04:11:20.210 --> 04:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh children under 18. so
 
04:11:22.010 --> 04:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
especially the area of Public Health
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
without the data from these uh
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
scientific surveys we can't measure the
 
04:11:28.610 --> 04:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
effective Public Health interactions we
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
can't we don't and we don't have a good
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
idea of how they affect our educational
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
system or our children and this is
 
04:11:37.490 --> 04:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
especially true of the substance abuse
 
04:11:39.290 --> 04:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
crisis but it applies a lot of other
 
04:11:41.330 --> 04:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
issues too so that I would
 
04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
basically uh you know it took a few I
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
think we uh got the law pretty much
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
right in 2015 there's a few changes from
 
04:11:52.250 --> 04:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
what the original Law in 2015 and so I I
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
urge you to uh
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
um sorry I urge you to finally fix this
 
04:11:58.969 --> 04:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
problem and allow our schools to
 
04:12:01.130 --> 04:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
participate in these surveys so I'd be
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if you'd
 
04:12:04.910 --> 04:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
like foreign
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions
 
04:12:08.990 --> 04:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you Mr
 
04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you uh representative
 
04:12:13.070 --> 04:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
Horrigan for uh coming back again this
 
04:12:13.080 --> 04:12:14.630 align:start position:0%
Horrigan for uh coming back again this
afternoon

04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I was interested in in your
 
04:12:18.769 --> 04:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
um and what you mentioned in terms of
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
the uh strict laws of the federal
 
04:12:26.030 --> 04:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
government related to data collection
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
programs uh such as with surveys and
 
04:12:33.889 --> 04:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons the opt-in was put
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
into law as I recall
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
was a federal provision called the
 
04:12:42.050 --> 04:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
protection of pupil Rights Amendment
 
04:12:45.070 --> 04:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
which specifies that
 
04:12:48.790 --> 04:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
any survey collecting
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
data as you'll see in lines 21 22 in in
 
04:12:56.150 --> 04:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:12:59.469 --> 04:12:59.479 align:start position:0%
um it's in current statute that is
 
04:13:04.330 --> 04:13:04.340 align:start position:0%
gathered via a federal funding must have
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
written parental consult and consent
 
04:13:08.880 --> 04:13:09.410 align:start position:0%
written parental consult and consent
um

04:13:09.410 --> 04:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:12.889 --> 04:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
and so as I recall the testimony when
 
04:13:15.050 --> 04:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
the opt-in provision was put into place
 
04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
it was to mirror federal law and the
 
04:13:20.150 --> 04:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
strict laws that you mentioned in your
 
04:13:20.160 --> 04:13:21.650 align:start position:0%
strict laws that you mentioned in your
testimony

04:13:21.650 --> 04:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:13:23.689 --> 04:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
um why is it that you think at this
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
point the federal requirements should be
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
eliminated from our provision for
 
04:13:33.650 --> 04:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys well I can't really
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
speak to whether or not that
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
summary what the law is and certainly um
 
04:13:41.689 --> 04:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
I mean certainly we would want parents
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
to like uh
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
part of the paperwork at the beginning
 
04:13:47.450 --> 04:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
of the semester would be this would be
 
04:13:49.370 --> 04:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
to have something you know opting into
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
any future surveys without uh without uh
 
04:13:54.530 --> 04:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
specifically you know without
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
specifically having to go through the
 
04:13:58.250 --> 04:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
paperwork every time to opt in so like
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh and of course this is uh enabling
 
04:14:03.650 --> 04:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'm sure the school
 
04:14:05.210 --> 04:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
districts can adopt a more restriction
 
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
policy if they feel that's in their
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
interests and then there's also there's
 
04:14:10.490 --> 04:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
some surveys
 
04:14:12.050 --> 04:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
that are not directly funded with
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
federal dollars like in that University
 
04:14:16.150 --> 04:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Ministries a lot of
 
04:14:19.010 --> 04:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
administrative surveys to a about
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
various topics to the students so that's
 
04:14:24.170 --> 04:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
um yes in terms of the federal law in
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
terms of federal law I can't
 
04:14:27.610 --> 04:14:27.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not prepared to say whether or not
 
04:14:30.290 --> 04:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
your summary what it says is correct or
 
04:14:31.729 --> 04:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
not so
 
04:14:33.050 --> 04:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to give you a copy I'll
 
04:14:34.610 --> 04:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
leave that for the committee committee
 
04:14:36.050 --> 04:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
may want to like dig into that support
 
04:14:37.849 --> 04:14:37.859 align:start position:0%
be glad to give the community a copy
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
sure but my follow-up question is
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
um in terms of a blanket acceptance or
 
04:14:45.120 --> 04:14:46.550 align:start position:0%
um in terms of a blanket acceptance or
provision

04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
um for uh consent at the beginning of
 
04:14:51.290 --> 04:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
the school year for any non-academic
 
04:14:51.300 --> 04:14:52.729 align:start position:0%
the school year for any non-academic
survey

04:14:52.729 --> 04:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
survey
 
04:14:56.150 --> 04:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
um I would think was in conflict with um
 
04:14:58.429 --> 04:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
beginning parts of the statute that
 
04:15:01.010 --> 04:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
requires individual notification and I
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
believe making available copies of the
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
survey to the parent before their
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
written consent so how would you see
 
04:15:14.210 --> 04:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
that additional parts of this
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislation might need to be amended in
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
order to provide a blanket beginning of
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
the year consent
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
certainly uh I was envisioning a blanket
 
04:15:28.250 --> 04:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
beginning with your consent and if
 
04:15:28.260 --> 04:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
beginning with your consent and if
that's

04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:15:31.370 --> 04:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
if what's what's in this bill isn't
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
sufficient to do to allow for that then
 
04:15:35.210 --> 04:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
obviously that's
 
04:15:36.650 --> 04:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's once again that's something else
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
the committee can look into during the
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
executive session and then the retained
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
Brew process if that's what they want
 
04:15:44.090 --> 04:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
but I do I do know that I've heard a lot
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
of concern from the research Community
 
04:15:48.889 --> 04:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
about the current law that it's uh it
 
04:15:51.050 --> 04:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
makes it very difficult to get
 
04:15:53.150 --> 04:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
meaningful data out of these
 
04:15:55.070 --> 04:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys
 
04:15:56.450 --> 04:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:58.429 --> 04:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
I have one question and then I'll open
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
it up to the rest of the committee uh on
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
line 12 and 13
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
you inserted language where it says
 
04:16:09.530 --> 04:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
um beyond the uh the survey developed by
 
04:16:11.150 --> 04:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
the Centers for Disease Control and
 
04:16:13.610 --> 04:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
prevention and you say and surveys
 
04:16:16.969 --> 04:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
related to other prevention programs so
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
this is appears to me
 
04:16:22.849 --> 04:16:22.859 align:start position:0%
is it providing that uh department on
 
04:16:26.090 --> 04:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
the federal level the ability to as you
 
04:16:26.100 --> 04:16:27.229 align:start position:0%
the federal level the ability to as you
say

04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
obtain research
 
04:16:29.279 --> 04:16:30.769 align:start position:0%
obtain research
uh

04:16:30.769 --> 04:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:30.779 --> 04:16:32.170 align:start position:0%
uh
without

04:16:32.170 --> 04:16:32.180 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
having to go through all the it just as
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
freely as they can with the Center for
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and prevention
 
04:16:42.290 --> 04:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
and what are these other surveys
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
Chicago's basically
 
04:16:46.969 --> 04:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
well what I had what I envisioned and um
 
04:16:48.290 --> 04:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's been envisioned the previous
 
04:16:50.689 --> 04:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
version of the pillow says if if there's
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
something in addition to the very
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
specific ybrs which is a lot yeah
 
04:16:57.050 --> 04:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
long-running survey if I remember
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
correctly it's administered just once
 
04:17:01.969 --> 04:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
every two years but the CDC decides to
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
expand that program then
 
04:17:06.170 --> 04:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be able to
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
participate and obviously so obviously
 
04:17:10.490 --> 04:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
the certainly you can't even have these
 
04:17:11.689 --> 04:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
surveys unless you know the department
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
the state so often very education I need
 
04:17:17.090 --> 04:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
just one clarification here as what you
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
just mentioned
 
04:17:20.929 --> 04:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
I understand the yrbs yeah we've been
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
doing that for years yeah now if that's
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
amended or if it's the same survey I
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's still allowable according to
 
04:17:31.849 --> 04:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
language previously had but it appears
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
that you're extending it beyond that to
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
other surveys or other forms of
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
gathering research by the federal
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
government is that where you're going I
 
04:17:44.090 --> 04:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
guess that uh
 
04:17:46.250 --> 04:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess I would say I guess I
 
04:17:48.110 --> 04:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
would probably say I would say probably
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
yes obviously the CDC would have to like
 
04:17:53.330 --> 04:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
establish the program it would have to
 
04:17:55.210 --> 04:17:55.220 align:start position:0%
pass you know mustard with the federal
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
you know the federal agency you know the
 
04:18:00.110 --> 04:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
federal bodies report to and then the
 
04:18:01.550 --> 04:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
state would have to approve our
 
04:18:03.290 --> 04:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
participation the survey and then I
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
suppose the school districts have their
 
04:18:07.070 --> 04:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
say on the two before the and of course
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
the parents will be notified about that
 
04:18:11.330 --> 04:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
just as they hear about the ybrs so they
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
would know about that so that's um I I
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't Envision any major changes in that
 
04:18:18.290 --> 04:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
for the next few next few years but just
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
in case
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
just in case they change the name of the
 
04:18:24.050 --> 04:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
ybrs or expand or come up with a similar
 
04:18:26.330 --> 04:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
surveys we'd like to be able to
 
04:18:28.729 --> 04:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
participate in them are there other
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
04:18:32.570 --> 04:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
04:18:34.490 --> 04:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
um so to clarify
 
04:18:37.199 --> 04:18:39.170 align:start position:0%
um so to clarify
um

04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
you agree that this this bill has the
 
04:18:45.969 --> 04:18:45.979 align:start position:0%
effect of uh creating rather than an opt
 
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
in system parents would have to opt out
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis for for these
 
04:18:51.479 --> 04:18:52.610 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis for for these
surveys

04:18:52.610 --> 04:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
04:18:57.050 --> 04:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
um yes exactly yes uh follow up to that
 
04:18:57.060 --> 04:18:58.330 align:start position:0%
um yes exactly yes uh follow up to that
um

04:18:58.330 --> 04:18:58.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:01.729 --> 04:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
I am aware of some more modern education
 
04:19:04.450 --> 04:19:04.460 align:start position:0%
models such as under the rubric of SEL
 
04:19:08.330 --> 04:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
where information that would be listed
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
under this previous prohibition is asked
 
04:19:13.250 --> 04:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis as a part of the
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
program to do essentially data mining to
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
do what they call generative themes
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
learning this could be incorporated into
 
04:19:22.969 --> 04:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
regular models so is it possible that
 
04:19:25.309 --> 04:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
with this requirement to both notify
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
parents and also to opt out on an
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
individual basis that parents could
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually wind up meaning to be informed
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
of and opting out of perhaps even
 
04:19:38.210 --> 04:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
multiple uh surveys on a daily basis
 
04:19:38.220 --> 04:19:40.570 align:start position:0%
multiple uh surveys on a daily basis
hello

04:19:40.570 --> 04:19:40.580 align:start position:0%
hello
 
04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not familiar with the details
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
what was that model of Education I
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
didn't catch the name of it uh SEO of
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning okay that's uh
 
04:19:52.250 --> 04:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
well I'm not I'm not on the humidity so
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
at the processor I have to admit that's
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
the first time I've heard of that
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
particular model of learning but I think
 
04:19:59.450 --> 04:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
I understand uh
 
04:20:01.370 --> 04:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
what it said so that's you know I mean
 
04:20:03.170 --> 04:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
if that's the integral part of the
 
04:20:05.689 --> 04:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
program then um
 
04:20:08.330 --> 04:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
presumably obviously the family has to
 
04:20:10.490 --> 04:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
opt into the whole program before the
 
04:20:13.130 --> 04:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
kid can be in it unless you know so
 
04:20:13.140 --> 04:20:13.729 align:start position:0%
kid can be in it unless you know so
um

04:20:13.729 --> 04:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:16.670 --> 04:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I mean he even is now on
 
04:20:19.729 --> 04:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
the other the anchorsy kids sort of had
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
the power to opt out they can refuse to
 
04:20:23.090 --> 04:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
participate in things although that's
 
04:20:24.889 --> 04:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult for a school child to
 
04:20:27.530 --> 04:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
do so that's um I don't know how that's
 
04:20:30.050 --> 04:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
different than the way these issues are
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with and uh and other educational
 
04:20:34.490 --> 04:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
models so that's not the best answer I
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
have thanks thank you
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald and then
 
04:20:40.370 --> 04:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you Mr chair
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for the testimony is there an
 
04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
ability for a parent to Simply opt out
 
04:20:47.150 --> 04:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
of all surveys for an academic year as
 
04:20:49.070 --> 04:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to as representative Belcher
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
noted maybe multiple in one day or this
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
could come to be quite a task for the
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
parents so again are they able to just
 
04:20:56.809 --> 04:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
opt out of all surveys for their
 
04:20:56.819 --> 04:20:58.309 align:start position:0%
opt out of all surveys for their
children

04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um that would
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
I would
 
04:21:02.570 --> 04:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that would probably be
 
04:21:04.010 --> 04:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
like that'd probably be an appropriate
 
04:21:05.389 --> 04:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
the school district could make a
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
procedure for that so I'm just trying to
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
change this so the
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
um the technology for them to opt-in
 
04:21:12.530 --> 04:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
they certainly actually I guess the
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
school district could make these surveys
 
04:21:17.090 --> 04:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
opt out which may create difficulty for
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
them in terms of funding and other other
 
04:21:20.929 --> 04:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
things but school districts are still
 
04:21:22.729 --> 04:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
free to go back to the opt-out model and
 
04:21:22.739 --> 04:21:23.630 align:start position:0%
free to go back to the opt-out model and
certainly

04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
I mean I suppose a parent probably could
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
just say they want to opt out of every
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
non-academic survey even if it's even if
 
04:21:32.150 --> 04:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to the opt-in model that I'm
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
envisioning with the bill so
 
04:21:37.610 --> 04:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you Mr
 
04:21:40.610 --> 04:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
chair before I ask my question
 
04:21:42.889 --> 04:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
um for the committee's information this
 
04:21:47.330 --> 04:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
is this bill has had a long history and
 
04:21:49.130 --> 04:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
we have we've worked on this for a
 
04:21:51.889 --> 04:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
number of years and what we found in the
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
past is that there were
 
04:21:56.689 --> 04:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
in some school districts there was
 
04:21:56.699 --> 04:21:58.370 align:start position:0%
in some school districts there was
inappropriate

04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
age inappropriate
 
04:22:03.849 --> 04:22:03.859 align:start position:0%
surveys that were being given by
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
independent teachers and it caused all
 
04:22:08.570 --> 04:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
and so as a compromise to all that we
 
04:22:15.170 --> 04:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
basically came up with the issue of the
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
yrbs the the youth risk behavior survey
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
which is an annual thing that gives a
 
04:22:22.610 --> 04:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
lot of information to school districts
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
about youth Behavior Uh which they then
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
can develop programs to address those
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
issues and so that's why we kind of zero
 
04:22:33.769 --> 04:22:33.779 align:start position:0%
it all down to the yrbs and I think so
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
my question yeah representative is that
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
what I hear you saying here is that
 
04:22:43.130 --> 04:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
you'd like to expand the option uh for
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
as you say here uh other related surveys
 
04:22:49.490 --> 04:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
out of the federal government that might
 
04:22:52.250 --> 04:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
deal with youth Behavior so that's
 
04:22:54.530 --> 04:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's one expansion and then the other
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
is basically moving back to an opt out
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
if parent parental opt out and the
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
reason why that's has been controversial
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
here is that in order to get
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the appropriate data to have the a
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
universe of those participating that
 
04:23:15.290 --> 04:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's that's significant enough that the
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
data is reliable and by having an opt-in
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
program uh we in fact I think we likened
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
it to sending a um a survey home with
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
kids for a field trip and it doesn't
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
come back and so how do you get that
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
data then how do you get that
 
04:23:36.189 --> 04:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
information from parents so the opt out
 
04:23:38.689 --> 04:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity for parents to
 
04:23:41.570 --> 04:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
be notified a of the survey is being
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
conducted for them to say okay or if I
 
04:23:46.370 --> 04:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
don't want that you can I don't want my
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
child to take that which is perfectly
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
fine so I think you're trying to move
 
04:23:52.490 --> 04:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
back to what we had before and then add
 
04:23:54.769 --> 04:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
potential others is that correct yes
 
04:23:56.210 --> 04:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's what I think Kim
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I will say
 
04:23:59.689 --> 04:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
Obviously when I was a kid it was back
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
in the 70s I think there probably heard
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
some the surveys Relentless regulated
 
04:24:05.210 --> 04:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
and probably I did answer some things
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
that may be weren't appropriate for my
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
age level but I think yeah
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
I would agree I would I would pay you I
 
04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
think you summarized my uh my thinking
 
04:24:14.809 --> 04:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh much better than I could have so
 
04:24:17.570 --> 04:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's an accurate summary so are there
 
04:24:20.210 --> 04:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.650 --> 04:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.660 --> 04:24:35.229 align:start position:0%

04:24:51.170 --> 04:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
hi okay thank you I appreciate the
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%

I'd like to tell you my real life
 
04:25:00.410 --> 04:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
experience with the cdc's youth risk
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
survey which is given to my kids yearly
 
04:25:05.450 --> 04:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
it was just given to students at SAU 34
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
last week on January 12th Thursday
 
04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
I read the survey and opted my kids out
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
because I already knew the questions
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
were Way Beyond their personal
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
boundaries I learned of the survey last
 
04:25:16.199 --> 04:25:16.910 align:start position:0%
boundaries I learned of the survey last
year

04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
my kids came home on Thursday to tell me
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
that the survey was given and that the
 
04:25:23.210 --> 04:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
other kids were really upset my son's
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
girlfriend who was a freshman told me
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
that she sat with her friends at lunch
 
04:25:28.250 --> 04:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
afterwards and talked about it
 
04:25:30.710 --> 04:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
I asked if anyone was traumatized or
 
04:25:33.170 --> 04:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
triggered by the survey and she quickly
 
04:25:36.110 --> 04:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
gave me an emphatic yes I acknowledged
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
that the survey had questions that were
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to be kept private and that she

04:26:25.010 --> 04:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
these are questions that should never be
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
asked of a child it's triggering
 
04:26:29.170 --> 04:26:29.180 align:start position:0%
boundary breaking and just not for kids
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
not no follow-up is given to these kids
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
they're left to die a little bit each
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
inside they deserve help after being
 
04:26:38.530 --> 04:26:38.540 align:start position:0%
asked if they were raped or abused
 
04:26:41.090 --> 04:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
instead they walk away lost with no
 
04:26:41.100 --> 04:26:42.110 align:start position:0%
instead they walk away lost with no
support

04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:26:43.849 --> 04:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
you can ask an 18 year old these
 
04:26:46.370 --> 04:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
questions not a child the stated can be
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
gathered from young adults children
 
04:26:50.210 --> 04:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
don't need to be subjected to this abuse
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
from the CDC to collect data I reject
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
this survey and any other non-academic
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
survey given to my child during school
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
hours surveys should never be given
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
without parental consent imagine parents
 
04:27:04.729 --> 04:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
who find out after the fact like my
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
son's girlfriend because they hadn't
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
read it ahead of time imagine finding
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
out that your 14 year old was asked
 
04:27:12.410 --> 04:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
about her sexual and criminal habits
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's getting into abuse territory and
 
04:27:17.450 --> 04:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
I think that's not okay these surveys
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
are unwanted by parents and they're
 
04:27:21.229 --> 04:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
grossly inappropriate for children stop
 
04:27:23.570 --> 04:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
them and always get permission first if
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
they are given I can't believe I really
 
04:27:27.889 --> 04:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
need to say this out loud it seems
 
04:27:30.050 --> 04:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
logical protect kids from unwanted
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
surveys without parents knowledge the
 
04:27:34.969 --> 04:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
year yearly CDC grooming of our kids is
 
04:27:37.070 --> 04:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
not welcome to New Hampshire parents and
 
04:27:39.410 --> 04:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
we want permission given first for
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%

04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the Department of
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%

future to for all the use in New I'm
 
04:29:59.450 --> 04:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
sure so in terms of the process we
 
04:30:01.969 --> 04:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the internal program
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
areas in the department as well as the
 
04:30:07.130 --> 04:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and also the

community organizations not only on the
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
questionnaire selections but also on the
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
service and also the program
 
04:30:19.149 --> 04:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
prevention part
 
04:30:21.070 --> 04:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:30:25.370 --> 04:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
process to only Minister yrbs we first
 
04:30:26.689 --> 04:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
definitely has identify the
 
04:30:28.250 --> 04:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
questionnaires and once the
 
04:30:30.530 --> 04:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
questionnaires is finalized the
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
department will post the questionnaires
 
04:30:34.450 --> 04:30:34.460 align:start position:0%
on our website
 
04:30:38.210 --> 04:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
provide you any school unless on their
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
first date
 
04:30:44.110 --> 04:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
and we were recruit the the high schools
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
through the school district to
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
um you know encourage them to
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
participate in yrbs and the school
 
04:30:53.689 --> 04:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
district and also the school boards has
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
totally uh control on whether the
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
schools would like to participate yrbs
 
04:31:01.330 --> 04:31:01.340 align:start position:0%
or not and whether they would like to
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
adapt it opt out or obtain approach So
 
04:31:07.250 --> 04:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire
 
04:31:11.649 --> 04:31:11.659 align:start position:0%
um for the current statute 186 1190
 
04:31:16.610 --> 04:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
for yrbs is an exception for opt-in so
 
04:31:19.450 --> 04:31:19.460 align:start position:0%
whether BS currently is opted out
 
04:31:22.370 --> 04:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
approach but the school district can
 
04:31:25.250 --> 04:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
choose if they would like to use opt-in
 
04:31:27.889 --> 04:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
approach I can provide some information
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the past years since I
 
04:31:35.210 --> 04:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
started this position there was no
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
school uh decided to use updating but
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
provide you like 2000 19 or as far as I
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
know there was one school they decided
 
04:31:48.410 --> 04:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
to use up in approach but the next time
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
when they uh Mr yabs they choose back to
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
opt out because they didn't get a really
 
04:31:57.290 --> 04:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
good response rate in order to get their
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
school data or provide the data to us
 
04:32:04.250 --> 04:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the confidentiality and
 
04:32:07.250 --> 04:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
private privacy yrbs
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the process is designed to protect
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
students privacy by allowing only
 
04:32:11.640 --> 04:32:13.090 align:start position:0%
students privacy by allowing only

04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to walk around you know and they
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
they are not allowed to look at the
 
04:33:06.289 --> 04:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
um the survey answer sheet after
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
students complete if they choose the
 
04:33:13.609 --> 04:33:13.619 align:start position:0%
paper format so starting 2021 we provide
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
two format one is the traditional paper
 
04:33:18.590 --> 04:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
format with the printout questionnaires
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
and also answer sheets to the schools we
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
also provide a Web format survey to
 
04:33:27.650 --> 04:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
allow a student to complete the survey
 
04:33:30.289 --> 04:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
through the web form met so those are
 
04:33:32.209 --> 04:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
the two formats that we currently
 
04:33:35.929 --> 04:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
provide to the school district for them
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
to you know choose which one would be
 
04:33:43.010 --> 04:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
best for their webs and I think that's
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
all I have before the process oh yes
 
04:33:48.650 --> 04:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you I just want
 
04:33:52.250 --> 04:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that the web yes um it is a
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
tool that can Catalyst for Community
 
04:33:59.631 --> 04:33:59.641 align:start position:0%
engagement and positive change this is
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
the only data set to understand the
 
04:34:05.949 --> 04:34:05.959 align:start position:0%
youth health and behavior risk factors
 
04:34:10.131 --> 04:34:10.141 align:start position:0%
for a long run the yrps data is valid
 
04:34:12.529 --> 04:34:12.539 align:start position:0%
and reliable and that reflects to use
 
04:34:15.890 --> 04:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
perceptions behavior and experience and
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
helps schools and communities determine
 
04:34:22.849 --> 04:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
the previous of health behavior and
 
04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
assess whether the behavior increase
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
decrease or keep the same level over
 
04:34:27.840 --> 04:34:28.730 align:start position:0%
decrease or keep the same level over
time

04:34:28.730 --> 04:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
so these Trends lines allow schools and
 
04:34:34.330 --> 04:34:34.340 align:start position:0%
communities to determine if intervention
 
04:34:37.730 --> 04:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
or prevention strategies are effective
 
04:34:40.970 --> 04:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
it also enables State and school
 
04:34:44.330 --> 04:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
districts and communities to assess to
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
access excuse me federal grants to
 
04:34:49.609 --> 04:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
assist local schools and communities in
 
04:34:52.730 --> 04:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
developing Health enhancing policies and
 
04:34:57.170 --> 04:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
programs for youth so that's what I have
 
04:34:59.810 --> 04:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
today I don't know I'm happy if I thank
 
04:35:01.131 --> 04:35:01.141 align:start position:0%
you we just we are not taking a position
 
04:35:03.170 --> 04:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
on this bill but we wanted to come and
 
04:35:04.609 --> 04:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
be a resource to the committee and
 
04:35:06.349 --> 04:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
provide some information I know you have
 
04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
some new members and I hope that was
 
04:35:10.189 --> 04:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
helpful also um any questions we'd be
 
04:35:12.109 --> 04:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
happy to thank you very much there's a
 
04:35:13.730 --> 04:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
long history of this bill
 
04:35:16.730 --> 04:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
are this topic uh one question I have
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
just can you reach I thought the yrbs
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
was given that one grade level within
 
04:35:24.289 --> 04:35:24.299 align:start position:0%
the high schools and now 9 through 12
 
04:35:26.570 --> 04:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
you're ministering each to all those
 
04:35:26.580 --> 04:35:27.650 align:start position:0%
you're ministering each to all those
grades

04:35:27.650 --> 04:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
grades
 
04:35:30.410 --> 04:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
that is correct so why IBS is
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
Administrative for old public high
 
04:35:35.769 --> 04:35:35.779 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire through grade
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
9-12 that's correct
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
so all enrolled students in that high
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
school will receive that
 
04:35:46.609 --> 04:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
assessment they have the opportunity to
 
04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
participate in the survey okay yes thank
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
you questions representative
 
04:35:56.269 --> 04:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:35:56.279 --> 04:35:56.929 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

04:35:56.929 --> 04:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:00.170 --> 04:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
money was alluded to earlier and doing
 
04:36:00.180 --> 04:36:01.551 align:start position:0%
money was alluded to earlier and doing
opt

04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
opt
 
04:36:01.561 --> 04:36:02.949 align:start position:0%
opt
in

04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
there was I guess
 
04:36:07.730 --> 04:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
threat of money being taken away by the
 
04:36:09.849 --> 04:36:09.859 align:start position:0%
federal government and so my question is
 
04:36:12.890 --> 04:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
where the schools are each individually
 
04:36:16.670 --> 04:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to choose opt-in or opt out and
 
04:36:18.890 --> 04:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
where that school did for one year
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
choose opt-in my question is if an
 
04:36:23.929 --> 04:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
individual school as opposed to the
 
04:36:23.939 --> 04:36:24.910 align:start position:0%
individual school as opposed to the
state

04:36:24.910 --> 04:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:36:28.189 --> 04:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
chooses opt in
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
do they have Federal funding taken away
 
04:36:33.890 --> 04:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.449 --> 04:36:37.459 align:start position:0%
well to participating why ABS is totally
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary and some states provide
 
04:36:45.070 --> 04:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
incentives for schools to participate in
 
04:36:48.650 --> 04:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any grant funding to be
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
taken from the school level but back to
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
yrbs if the school choose to opt in then
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
we would take Aberdeen and there's no
 
04:37:01.490 --> 04:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
funding will be taken from the
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
Department thank you
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
representative uh cardelli and then
 
04:37:09.769 --> 04:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
representative Damon uh thank you Mr
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you both for uh being
 
04:37:11.879 --> 04:37:13.070 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you both for uh being
here

04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:37:14.449 --> 04:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
um and you were correct in your
 
04:37:16.910 --> 04:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
observation with a lot of new members
 
04:37:16.920 --> 04:37:17.769 align:start position:0%
observation with a lot of new members
um

04:37:17.769 --> 04:37:17.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:20.929 --> 04:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
first question um I guess would be um I
 
04:37:24.109 --> 04:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
I think you heard the previous testimony
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
um that uh the uh lady mentioned some of
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
um on this year's uh survey that um she
 
04:37:35.449 --> 04:37:35.459 align:start position:0%
had thought were um possibly an
 
04:37:37.970 --> 04:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
intrusive intrusive or inappropriate for
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh her child and I was wondering if um
 
04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
you had any thoughts on maybe any of
 
04:37:46.970 --> 04:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
those questions you had you had heard
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
um as to the regard to their usefulness
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
and and some follow-up to the survey and
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
whether they might be appropriate for
 
04:38:01.929 --> 04:38:01.939 align:start position:0%
certain age levels or not
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question and this
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
is very important so some questions in
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
the yrbs survey
 
04:38:12.289 --> 04:38:12.299 align:start position:0%
um may be consider as a sensitive uh
 
04:38:14.631 --> 04:38:14.641 align:start position:0%
questions to the students at that age
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
however asking the question in a very
 
04:38:22.689 --> 04:38:22.699 align:start position:0%
direct way uh is what um you know
 
04:38:26.929 --> 04:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
for the long run CDC had yrbs since 1991
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
and so the questions are kind of
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
have have a kind of like a scientific
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
validation to ask that way to the
 
04:38:39.890 --> 04:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
students so some questions like drug use
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
or attempted suicide tobacco use or
 
04:38:44.650 --> 04:38:44.660 align:start position:0%
alcohol use
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
weapon carrying may come may be
 
04:38:49.490 --> 04:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
considered as very sensitive to the
 
04:38:52.631 --> 04:38:52.641 align:start position:0%
students that that party it is accurate
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
therefore in our training to the schools
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
and school coordinator and
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
administrators would be mentioned about
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
that part that the schools may want to
 
04:39:03.769 --> 04:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
consult the students or students feels
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable before after the the
 
04:39:09.529 --> 04:39:09.539 align:start position:0%
survey school we encourage the school to
 
04:39:11.449 --> 04:39:11.459 align:start position:0%
reach out to students and have some
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
consultation to the student for them to
 
04:39:16.970 --> 04:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
be able to talk about their feelings the
 
04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
other part that I want to mention is
 
04:39:22.570 --> 04:39:22.580 align:start position:0%
students has students have the option to
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
you know to choose that they don't want
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
to participate the survey even
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
on the survey date or any time during
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
the survey if they don't want to answer
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
the question they can skip the question
 
04:39:39.770 --> 04:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
and go to the next uh or they can you
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
know decide that they don't want to
 
04:39:44.570 --> 04:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
participate the survey then then they
 
04:39:46.490 --> 04:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't need to answer any questions so
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty or there's no
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
um performance or would impact if they
 
04:39:54.050 --> 04:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
don't answer the question or if they
 
04:39:56.330 --> 04:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
don't participate this way during the
 
04:39:56.340 --> 04:39:57.410 align:start position:0%
don't participate this way during the
survey

04:39:57.410 --> 04:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
survey
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question yes thank you I'm
 
04:40:03.770 --> 04:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
glad to hear that um you uh tell the
 
04:40:05.170 --> 04:40:05.180 align:start position:0%
schools that
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
they might follow up with students on
 
04:40:09.890 --> 04:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
some of these questions such as suicide
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
because I remember when we did the uh
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
Suicide Hotline uh number being put on
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
the ID cards we had discussion whether
 
04:40:23.150 --> 04:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
that was going to put suicide in the
 
04:40:26.930 --> 04:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
child's mind possibly so and I see that
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
could happen with this so I'm glad to
 
04:40:30.650 --> 04:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
hear that you offer that advice but also
 
04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
on the advice side I was wondering if
 
04:40:34.850 --> 04:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
your department or maybe the Department
 
04:40:37.970 --> 04:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
of Education had issued any advisories
 
04:40:41.448 --> 04:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
to local schools that they could change
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
from opt out to opt in in relation to
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.958 --> 04:40:49.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:40:49.970 --> 04:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:53.330 --> 04:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
you want to take the up top sure thank
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure I I don't have the
 
04:40:57.650 --> 04:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
answers to whether the schools have
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
given that that
 
04:41:01.250 --> 04:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
um been guidance by the Department of
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
Education on whether the about the
 
04:41:04.610 --> 04:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
opt-in and opt out of individual schools
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
I I would remind the committee that
 
04:41:09.170 --> 04:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
um the it is uh the school's
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility per law to post the the
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
survey online for parents to um have
 
04:41:16.850 --> 04:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
access to that prior to the application
 
04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
of the survey so those questions are
 
04:41:20.510 --> 04:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
there and parents can review them and
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
decide whether they feel comfortable
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
having their child participate in or not
 
04:41:26.090 --> 04:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
I mean that's already in statute that
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
that be done by the schools
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
think thank you and I'm sorry I just
 
04:41:32.350 --> 04:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on that the department
 
04:41:36.650 --> 04:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
also provide opt out uh template and we
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
posted the template on our website as
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
well for
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
um parents who if they do not receive
 
04:41:44.930 --> 04:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
directly from the schools they are able
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
to print it out and sign the opt-out
 
04:41:50.350 --> 04:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
form and and hand it back to the schools
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
and in terms of up in we provide the
 
04:41:56.570 --> 04:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
operating template per request so so far
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
no schools are requesting update but
 
04:42:02.930 --> 04:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
again this will be the school district
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and School Board decision if they would
 
04:42:08.410 --> 04:42:08.420 align:start position:0%
like to take up in or up and down option
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
from the Department standpoint we do
 
04:42:14.750 --> 04:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
encourage uh the the school district and
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
schools to
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
um you know involve parents to provide
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
them the essential information so some
 
04:42:24.650 --> 04:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
schools reached out to us it to us if we
 
04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
have some fact sheets to be able to
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
provide in their community education and
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
we also provide that for the schools to
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
enhance the communication between the
 
04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
schools and parents for them to
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
understand what yrbs is used for how how
 
04:42:43.010 --> 04:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
questions are what questions are asked
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
to their kids
 
04:42:47.330 --> 04:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Damon
 
04:42:49.128 --> 04:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:42:51.610 --> 04:42:51.620 align:start position:0%
another question
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
and actually a comment first it would be
 
04:42:55.550 --> 04:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
lovely if you could provide that fact
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
sheet to the committee please
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and my question is is this survey the
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
same in every state it comes from the
 
04:43:06.170 --> 04:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
CDC and all the students across the
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
country who do it get the same questions
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
or is it modified at all thank you for
 
04:43:12.890 --> 04:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
that question uh we have fact sheet here
 
04:43:14.690 --> 04:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
but I don't think I have enough copy
 
04:43:16.910 --> 04:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
copies um so that we will distribute
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
that later out in terms of questions for
 
04:43:23.208 --> 04:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
ybs we have uh there is a very strict um
 
04:43:26.570 --> 04:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
guidance how questions are selected uh
 
04:43:29.330 --> 04:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
so first of all CDC will provide the
 
04:43:31.970 --> 04:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
standard questions to all the states who
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
participate in yrbs and from the
 
04:43:37.730 --> 04:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
standard questionnaires each state or
 
04:43:41.288 --> 04:43:41.298 align:start position:0%
each jurisdiction needs to select a two
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
two-thirds questions from that standard
 
04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
question which is about 60 Questions six
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
zero questions would be from the
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
standard questionnaires and we are not
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to change any wording even the
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
like a common over the period any
 
04:43:58.850 --> 04:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
characters from those standard questions
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the questions like
 
04:44:04.010 --> 04:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
one-third of questions about 30 or 40
 
04:44:07.610 --> 04:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
questions uh states can choose from
 
04:44:08.930 --> 04:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:44:12.650 --> 04:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
um uh State focused questions or state
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
added questions CDC also provides
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
um the optional modules uh for the state
 
04:44:21.170 --> 04:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
you take into account
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so for those questions like the
 
04:44:26.090 --> 04:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
sexual behaviors or drug use most of
 
04:44:27.410 --> 04:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
them are from the standard
 
04:44:31.010 --> 04:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
questionnaires so that the CDC that they
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
will have like a National Database or
 
04:44:36.170 --> 04:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
National Data analysis to see how each
 
04:44:38.208 --> 04:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
state is doing compared to the National
 
04:44:40.490 --> 04:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
or compared to other states those
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions are standardized and and each
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
um States if they choose to have that
 
04:44:47.090 --> 04:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
question that would be the same
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
questions as an among the nation
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that was helpful for the
 
04:44:55.730 --> 04:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
questions representative uh try and then
 
04:44:58.250 --> 04:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
Belcher anybody on that side
 
04:45:01.010 --> 04:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
are you a male okay
 
04:45:03.550 --> 04:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for um
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
taking this question I sat in um not too
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
long ago on a meeting of social service
 
04:45:12.410 --> 04:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
agencies uh last time the the study was
 
04:45:16.010 --> 04:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
up and um they were complaining about
 
04:45:18.770 --> 04:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
students who bragged about lying on the
 
04:45:22.190 --> 04:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
survey and uh and I didn't know at this
 
04:45:24.288 --> 04:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
point that it was required to take you
 
04:45:26.090 --> 04:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
know I just thought well couldn't they
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
just have people opt in who are serious
 
04:45:29.930 --> 04:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
about doing it and they said no we need
 
04:45:31.850 --> 04:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
the numbers so that we can get the money
 
04:45:34.128 --> 04:45:34.138 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned that we are putting
 
04:45:37.128 --> 04:45:37.138 align:start position:0%
social service agencies on a on a tight
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
wire you know they have to live with
 
04:45:42.650 --> 04:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps invalid answers to survey just
 
04:45:44.448 --> 04:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
to get the money so that maybe it's a
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
deeper problem than just opt-in or opt
 
04:45:48.590 --> 04:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
out but I wonder if you had any thoughts
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
on whether there's more accurate
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
information if someone is opting in then
 
04:45:54.530 --> 04:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
rather opting out
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you for the question I
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
would like to answer for the first part
 
04:46:00.650 --> 04:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
with the kids
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
um you know truthfully uh respond to the
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
questions or not
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
I don't deny that there are some
 
04:46:11.330 --> 04:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
students they may not provided the truth
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh answer uh to the questions or they
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
might be you know kind of like not
 
04:46:18.590 --> 04:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
taking it seriously
 
04:46:18.600 --> 04:46:19.788 align:start position:0%
taking it seriously
um

04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
there we don't have a really kind of
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
like a number to see how it was a
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of kids are doing that but it
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
definitely there are some students
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
um when they when they take the survey
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
on their behaviors like that which I
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
just joke around I don't deny that part
 
04:46:39.650 --> 04:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
however uh for the data analysis
 
04:46:39.660 --> 04:46:41.090 align:start position:0%
however uh for the data analysis
standpoint

04:46:41.090 --> 04:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
um yrbs is still valid even though there
 
04:46:46.250 --> 04:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
are small percentage of students who
 
04:46:49.010 --> 04:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
don't take Webbs seriously the majority
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
of students they do provide the truthful
 
04:46:54.470 --> 04:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
answer and that is a very important for
 
04:46:58.010 --> 04:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
us uh for yfs we do have two data cells
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
the first data set is assembling data
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
set which is randomly selected from all
 
04:47:05.690 --> 04:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
the sensors for all the public schools
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
we pick the randomly pick several
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
classrooms from each schools and compile
 
04:47:14.090 --> 04:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
the simple data set for that one we will
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
have a waiting uh process to provide the
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
confidence intervals for the future data
 
04:47:23.208 --> 04:47:23.218 align:start position:0%
analysis to see if this
 
04:47:26.510 --> 04:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
um if if it is stayed over the state um
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh from the time Trend to see if they
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
there is any significance increase or
 
04:47:33.948 --> 04:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
decrease on the same topic so for that
 
04:47:37.368 --> 04:47:37.378 align:start position:0%
simple data set uh because of the valid
 
04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
scientific data analysis process it
 
04:47:41.940 --> 04:47:43.850 align:start position:0%
scientific data analysis process it
actually

04:47:43.850 --> 04:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:47:43.860 --> 04:47:45.650 align:start position:0%
actually
eliminated

04:47:45.650 --> 04:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
04:47:48.770 --> 04:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
um truthful answers and and during the
 
04:47:52.730 --> 04:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
data analysis process we also have some
 
04:47:55.610 --> 04:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
kind of editing if the kids not the kids
 
04:47:58.368 --> 04:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
if it is a record answer that for the
 
04:48:00.650 --> 04:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
first question it's like I never had sex
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the following question uh uh the
 
04:48:06.650 --> 04:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
record shows that I have sex like every
 
04:48:08.810 --> 04:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
day or I have sex with drugs then this
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
record will be invalid so we have some
 
04:48:13.610 --> 04:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
kind of like a data um validation
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
process in place to to to see the group
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
of questions whether there's some kind
 
04:48:21.650 --> 04:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
of conflicted answers if there's a
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
conflict answer then this this question
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
will be involved so in terms of if kids
 
04:48:30.288 --> 04:48:30.298 align:start position:0%
tell lies how about it with the data
 
04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
analysis be over or the estimate be we
 
04:48:35.448 --> 04:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
are very confident that the ybs is is
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
very valid
 
04:48:39.410 --> 04:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and provide a very reliable data
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
analysis across the time from the 10
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
years ago until now so that's what we
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
see from the data analysis part in terms
 
04:48:49.250 --> 04:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
of up in the up down
 
04:48:49.260 --> 04:48:50.890 align:start position:0%
of up in the up down
um

04:48:50.890 --> 04:48:50.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
country New Hampshire is taking opt out
 
04:48:57.050 --> 04:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
approach to be opted in uh it will
 
04:48:59.930 --> 04:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
increase loss of Burden not only on the
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
Stateside but also on the school
 
04:49:04.128 --> 04:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
district side to collect each individual
 
04:49:07.070 --> 04:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
opt-in forms and also to track students
 
04:49:09.288 --> 04:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
hey do you want to you know turn in the
 
04:49:11.810 --> 04:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
operating form uh and in order to take
 
04:49:13.490 --> 04:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
the survey
 
04:49:15.530 --> 04:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
um and if the
 
04:49:18.288 --> 04:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
if the number of students who
 
04:49:21.650 --> 04:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
participate in survey is less than the
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
response rate we have the sixty percent
 
04:49:26.208 --> 04:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
six zero percent response rate in order
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
to make a valid data set for upping
 
04:49:32.650 --> 04:49:32.660 align:start position:0%
options we do see
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
impact on the response rate may reduce
 
04:49:40.250 --> 04:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
and for us to be able to get a good
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
sample size in order to provide more
 
04:49:45.770 --> 04:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
accurate estimates so that is the
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
concern on the opening we may not be
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
able to get enough uh response in order
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
to meet the 60 response rate and not
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
only for the school data but also for
 
04:49:59.330 --> 04:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
the entire State data
 
04:50:01.368 --> 04:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent Belcher
 
04:50:03.470 --> 04:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
do you have a question yes thank you Mr
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh regarding this the bill and the
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
new language on lines 12 and 13
 
04:50:14.690 --> 04:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
regarding exempting other surveys from
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
the CDC uh this sets off my Spidey
 
04:50:19.490 --> 04:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
senses a little bit as far as far as
 
04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
what might exist Does the department
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
have access to a comprehensive list of
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
surveys that the CDC might provide and
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
if so can you get that to the committee
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
so for the Department yrbs is the only
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
survey that we earn administered to the
 
04:50:39.050 --> 04:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
high school students to public high
 
04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
school students I'm not aware of other
 
04:50:46.010 --> 04:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
um surveys to the public schools
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
students sponsored by CDC in the
 
04:50:51.170 --> 04:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
department so I'm not able to answer
 
04:50:54.170 --> 04:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
that part okay thank you
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
04:50:58.010 --> 04:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
I need just one point of clarification
 
04:51:00.650 --> 04:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
here we have written in statutory
 
04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
language opt out
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
we've had that discussion over every
 
04:51:08.270 --> 04:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
year I've been here opt-in versus opt
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
out and I'm hearing that we may be able
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
to do opt in at the local school
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
district decides to do so is that
 
04:51:15.120 --> 04:51:18.110 align:start position:0%
district decides to do so is that
correct

04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
if the school district decide to do
 
04:51:24.410 --> 04:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
opt-in then they yes they can they can
 
04:51:27.230 --> 04:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
address that if they want to provide
 
04:51:29.448 --> 04:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
they want you to opt in and we will do
 
04:51:31.368 --> 04:51:31.378 align:start position:0%
our best to
 
04:51:33.410 --> 04:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
um you know Assist the school to get
 
04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
updating but like what I mentioned
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
earlier it requires lots of resource and
 
04:51:42.010 --> 04:51:42.020 align:start position:0%
time from the schools to do opt-in
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the current law allows yrbs
 
04:51:49.550 --> 04:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
to remain up there which is a passive
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
parent consent but back to the uh
 
04:51:55.730 --> 04:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
chairman your questions if the school
 
04:51:58.128 --> 04:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
decide um you know after consideration
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
they really want you to opt in then yes
 
04:52:04.550 --> 04:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
we will be able to do that however
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
the school may not be able to get their
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
school a report because of low response
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
rate if they take up in approach yes we
 
04:52:14.948 --> 04:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
hear about that from the teacher
 
04:52:17.810 --> 04:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh the one one other question I have for
 
04:52:17.820 --> 04:52:19.010 align:start position:0%
uh the one one other question I have for
you

04:52:19.010 --> 04:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
um there's a bank of require there's a
 
04:52:25.788 --> 04:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
required section uh questions that the
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
federal government or CDC has then
 
04:52:30.410 --> 04:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's a bank of questions which are
 
04:52:30.420 --> 04:52:31.850 align:start position:0%
there's a bank of questions which are
optional

04:52:31.850 --> 04:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
optional
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
who decides which optional questions are
 
04:52:38.090 --> 04:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
used is it HHS or is it Doe
 
04:52:41.628 --> 04:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
so that is another good question so we
 
04:52:44.030 --> 04:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
do collaborate with uh Department of
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
Education and also our internal program
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
areas like injury prevention program
 
04:52:53.208 --> 04:52:53.218 align:start position:0%
um uh and uh Bureau of drug and alcohol
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
Services as well as the Community
 
04:53:00.490 --> 04:53:00.500 align:start position:0%
Partners like Nam Nami New Hampshire
 
04:53:03.288 --> 04:53:03.298 align:start position:0%
and also the trafficking
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
um excuse me the trafficking program and
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
also some School District to do the
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
question selection based on the
 
04:53:17.208 --> 04:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
priorities so so it's not just a solo
 
04:53:19.490 --> 04:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
decision from the Department to choose
 
04:53:22.010 --> 04:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
the questions in the questionnaires is a
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the department and
 
04:53:27.170 --> 04:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
department and also the local area and
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
also the local communities
 
04:53:32.930 --> 04:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Island thank you Mr
 
04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
chairman I mean this has been an
 
04:53:35.810 --> 04:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation about the
 
04:53:38.090 --> 04:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
process of gathering the data my
 
04:53:40.970 --> 04:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
question is what do you do with the data
 
04:53:43.128 --> 04:53:43.138 align:start position:0%
that that's another good question as
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
well so from the department-wide we do
 
04:53:48.288 --> 04:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
release the state level and also the
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health Region level because those
 
04:53:52.730 --> 04:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
are from the simple size with um
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
confidence interval analysis in place we
 
04:53:59.810 --> 04:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
release this data on our DHHS data
 
04:54:02.830 --> 04:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
portal website and we also provide
 
04:54:05.288 --> 04:54:05.298 align:start position:0%
static like PDF
 
04:54:09.708 --> 04:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
data reporting on our website as well we
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
provided a school district their own
 
04:54:14.448 --> 04:54:14.458 align:start position:0%
school or Community report to the
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent for them to understand
 
04:54:19.730 --> 04:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
the survey result from their particular
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
scores however in that type of data set
 
04:54:25.368 --> 04:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
it because it's not a weighted data set
 
04:54:28.610 --> 04:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
which means there is no indicator to
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
show that this estimate this percentage
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the school is doing better or worse
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
compared to the state original so so we
 
04:54:40.850 --> 04:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
we do not encourage the school to to
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
make that kind of statement and yet for
 
04:54:45.368 --> 04:54:45.378 align:start position:0%
them to understand
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
what each individual questions what's
 
04:54:50.930 --> 04:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
the percentage of the students in their
 
04:54:54.368 --> 04:54:54.378 align:start position:0%
school respond to that question
 
04:54:57.770 --> 04:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
for the data part there are several uh
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
parties that we use the data and if I
 
04:55:03.530 --> 04:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
may excuse me I will need to check my
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
list here
 
04:55:04.920 --> 04:55:06.110 align:start position:0%
list here
um

04:55:06.110 --> 04:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
so basically it's for the community
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
prevention so they're like mental health
 
04:55:13.320 --> 04:55:15.170 align:start position:0%
prevention so they're like mental health
questions

04:55:15.170 --> 04:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:55:19.368 --> 04:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
um about you know uh field Stat or feel
 
04:55:22.490 --> 04:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
hopeless these type of questions and for
 
04:55:25.010 --> 04:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
program areas such as injury prevention
 
04:55:28.690 --> 04:55:28.700 align:start position:0%
program over over our mental health
 
04:55:31.550 --> 04:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau or program areas they will use
 
04:55:34.670 --> 04:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
this type of type of data and to work
 
04:55:37.070 --> 04:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
with the communities or we work with the
 
04:55:40.490 --> 04:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
region to put a resource and and provide
 
04:55:41.650 --> 04:55:41.660 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
04:55:45.170 --> 04:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
assistance to the areas that will need
 
04:55:49.368 --> 04:55:49.378 align:start position:0%
to have that they focused on so
 
04:55:54.530 --> 04:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
so uh data is do IBS data is used by um
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
uh various programs or various
 
04:55:59.810 --> 04:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
communities uh and also the school
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
district to look into their particular
 
04:56:07.390 --> 04:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
area in terms of uh the specific survey
 
04:56:09.890 --> 04:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
response and also might be able to
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
compare to the previous years on this on
 
04:56:15.650 --> 04:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
on the um estimate for the same
 
04:56:15.660 --> 04:56:17.868 align:start position:0%
on the um estimate for the same
questions

04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
04:56:19.440 --> 04:56:20.750 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

04:56:20.750 --> 04:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:56:24.770 --> 04:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't believe we have any
 
04:56:28.190 --> 04:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
other pink cards on that bill
 
04:56:39.530 --> 04:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:44.090 --> 04:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:45.650 --> 04:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's about electronically up there but
 
04:56:47.690 --> 04:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
they also talk about web down here so
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:40.920 --> 05:02:42.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:02:44.448 --> 05:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee this is the first bill that
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing my first term so please
 
05:02:50.448 --> 05:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
bear with me
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
um the background behind this is that
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire constitution of course
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh recognizes the value of Education
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know tells us to cherish
 
05:03:02.930 --> 05:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
it and a huge amount of what we do is
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
about that process
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh with anything where we wish to
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
achieve goals the proper approach is to
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
measure outcomes not inputs when we are
 
05:03:14.750 --> 05:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
specifying healthy uh water uh we
 
05:03:16.730 --> 05:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
specify the lead must be below this that
 
05:03:18.050 --> 05:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
you know on and on and on with all the
 
05:03:20.448 --> 05:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
details and we don't specify the inputs
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
we don't say that water treatment must
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
take at least uh you know 46 hours we
 
05:03:27.410 --> 05:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
don't specify how much must be spent in
 
05:03:29.330 --> 05:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
a similar way I think it is appropriate
 
05:03:31.250 --> 05:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
that to make sure that education is done
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
correctly we allow an extra option and
 
05:03:35.930 --> 05:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
right now there's two options there's at
 
05:03:38.090 --> 05:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
least two Public Schools private schools
 
05:03:40.368 --> 05:03:40.378 align:start position:0%
and homeschooling
 
05:03:42.830 --> 05:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know one thing that we
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
measure with Public Schools is just
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
inputs that you must remain in your seat
 
05:03:47.448 --> 05:03:47.458 align:start position:0%
for 12 years you must you know go
 
05:03:49.550 --> 05:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
through a certain number of classes
 
05:03:51.470 --> 05:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and there are some students uh who
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
are uh fortunate enough to be in
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
families where one of the parents can
 
05:03:56.330 --> 05:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
take on homeschooling
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
um but if a child through no fault of
 
05:03:59.570 --> 05:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
his own is not in such a family but
 
05:04:01.368 --> 05:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
still uh believes that there's sort of
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
more that he can achieve in life and he
 
05:04:04.128 --> 05:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
would like to accelerate his or her
 
05:04:06.530 --> 05:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
education uh there's currently no option
 
05:04:08.090 --> 05:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
to achieve that
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
um at least at the state level
 
05:04:12.770 --> 05:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
so the intent behind this is to allow
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
any student who learns on his own uh to
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
prove that he has satisfied all of the
 
05:04:18.000 --> 05:04:19.190 align:start position:0%
prove that he has satisfied all of the
requirements

05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:04:22.250 --> 05:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
um of a public school education and thus
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
get his degree early and move on to
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
whatever is next for him or her whether
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's you know college or trade school
 
05:04:30.050 --> 05:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
or something else
 
05:04:30.060 --> 05:04:31.070 align:start position:0%
or something else
um

05:04:31.070 --> 05:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:33.530 --> 05:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
and uh that is the overall Gestalt of
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
The Proposal uh and one thing I would
 
05:04:38.208 --> 05:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
like to speak to is concerns about
 
05:04:42.650 --> 05:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
implementation or cost and the analysis
 
05:04:44.090 --> 05:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
um you know does not say that there are
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily any cost but does note that
 
05:04:48.128 --> 05:04:48.138 align:start position:0%
they are indeterminable
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
there is already a process for
 
05:04:54.410 --> 05:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
assessment of students in schools and
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
how much they've attained and the
 
05:04:57.770 --> 05:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
results of this are available per
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
account at the department of education's
 
05:04:59.520 --> 05:05:00.948 align:start position:0%
account at the department of education's
website

05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
website
 
05:05:02.810 --> 05:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
um looking at it briefly this morning
 
05:05:05.208 --> 05:05:05.218 align:start position:0%
there was something like two percent of
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
students who were assessed via existing
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
testing tests above the requirements 35
 
05:05:14.208 --> 05:05:14.218 align:start position:0%
percent or so Statewide test at uh
 
05:05:16.730 --> 05:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
requirements some percent test partially
 
05:05:19.850 --> 05:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
hitting requirements so I phrased this
 
05:05:22.730 --> 05:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
in a very open-minded way for the
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that they can
 
05:05:26.690 --> 05:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
create whatever assessment tool that
 
05:05:28.430 --> 05:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
they think is appropriate but certainly
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
one possible way to do it would be to
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
reuse exist testing assessment tests
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
these are already seen as a reasonably
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate tool because they're what we
 
05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
are using to judge the performance of
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
the various high schools across the
 
05:05:43.128 --> 05:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
state and so that is a way that I think
 
05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
that this could be accomplished for
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
those few students who wish to opt into
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
a testing and potentially graduate ahead
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
of time with a certificate proving their
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
Mastery of subjects without spinning up
 
05:05:57.050 --> 05:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
a huge new research projects or tests or
 
05:05:57.060 --> 05:05:57.948 align:start position:0%
a huge new research projects or tests or
anything

05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I welcome any questions
 
05:06:03.170 --> 05:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:06:03.180 --> 05:06:09.590 align:start position:0%
very much
306

05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:09.600 --> 05:06:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
.

05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
.
 
05:06:13.010 --> 05:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
we're looking at our education role CD
 
05:06:16.010 --> 05:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
306 we talk about competencies and the
 
05:06:17.690 --> 05:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
competencies are established by the
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
local school boards for courses and the
 
05:06:23.390 --> 05:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
grad and the diploma is issued by a
 
05:06:27.230 --> 05:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
local school district or High School
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
so are we talking about in here that the
 
05:06:34.128 --> 05:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
the state of Alaska now excuse me I'm
 
05:06:37.448 --> 05:06:37.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
great state that's a wonderful state
 
05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh State of New Hampshire doe is going
 
05:06:45.770 --> 05:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
to get into the business
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
of issuing graduation diplomas now and
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
taking that away from the local
 
05:06:54.830 --> 05:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh that is a great question uh and I
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
understand the concern
 
05:06:58.128 --> 05:06:58.138 align:start position:0%
um as written
 
05:07:02.208 --> 05:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
um the bill says that the uh Department
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
of Education is in charge of that but I
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
would certainly be willing to submit a
 
05:07:10.490 --> 05:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh clarifying that uh that the
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh Talent level uh government is
 
05:07:16.550 --> 05:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for setting standards uh
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
probably relevant to their own uh
 
05:07:20.510 --> 05:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
existing High School
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
well okay uh uh and I have one other
 
05:07:27.490 --> 05:07:27.500 align:start position:0%
question here too on line 25
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.368 --> 05:07:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:40.490 --> 05:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me online 24 and child age 13
 
05:07:42.170 --> 05:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
or older whether a citizen of New
 
05:07:44.448 --> 05:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or or elsewhere
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
may take the test
 
05:07:48.770 --> 05:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
are we talking about
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
a kid in Alaska
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
um I put this in here so that uh if
 
05:07:56.690 --> 05:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
there was a case where uh two parents uh
 
05:07:58.368 --> 05:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
shared custody of a child across the
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
state line that there would not be any
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
question that the student who spends
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
part of his time in New Hampshire uh
 
05:08:06.410 --> 05:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
even if you know he didn't meet full
 
05:08:08.570 --> 05:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
citizenship requirements basically just
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
to avoid that question and you know
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a question that uh
 
05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
comes up in sort of voting discussions
 
05:08:15.288 --> 05:08:15.298 align:start position:0%
and our college students residents or
 
05:08:17.390 --> 05:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
citizens I just wanted to remove that uh
 
05:08:20.208 --> 05:08:20.218 align:start position:0%
possible complexity thank you for other
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Ellison oh
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:08:26.090 --> 05:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
my question I'm with bills on what
 
05:08:28.550 --> 05:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd just asked asked
 
05:08:31.490 --> 05:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
about whether if this was in place and
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
it would relate to a citizen of New
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or elsewhere
 
05:08:35.520 --> 05:08:37.090 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or elsewhere
yeah

05:08:37.090 --> 05:08:37.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:08:40.730 --> 05:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
and were you know I've dealt a whole
 
05:08:42.410 --> 05:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
throughout my career with high school
 
05:08:42.420 --> 05:08:43.670 align:start position:0%
throughout my career with high school
quality

05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
quality
 
05:08:47.090 --> 05:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
programs and accelerated programs and so
 
05:08:49.610 --> 05:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
on but by including elsewhere and I
 
05:08:51.470 --> 05:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
understand your example
 
05:08:54.170 --> 05:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
are we also looking at the possibility
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
of 50 Vermont students who are 13 coming
 
05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
across the board and taking a test of 75
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
for Maine and 150 for Massachusetts
 
05:09:06.110 --> 05:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
because they would qualify that is an
 
05:09:07.368 --> 05:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and and thank you for it and uh I
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
think that probably it deserves a
 
05:09:14.448 --> 05:09:14.458 align:start position:0%
amendment to make sure that uh there was
 
05:09:16.970 --> 05:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
at least some Nexus with residents in
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:09:20.090 --> 05:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:22.270 --> 05:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative a couple
 
05:09:26.690 --> 05:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
questions I may you made the comment
 
05:09:28.610 --> 05:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
that 12 years of sitting in your seat
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
you realize that doesn't happen right
 
05:09:32.330 --> 05:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
you realize that the kids are taking
 
05:09:34.970 --> 05:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
external programs learn everywhere doing
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
internships local school systems allow
 
05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
kids to uh earn enough graduation
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
credits sometimes in June year sometimes
 
05:09:44.448 --> 05:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
a senior year so that accusation that
 
05:09:46.010 --> 05:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
that stereotype would just sit there
 
05:09:48.670 --> 05:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
back in 1950 is not really true in 19
 
05:09:51.230 --> 05:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
2023 you understand that that's a good
 
05:09:54.770 --> 05:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
question and uh I do understand that and
 
05:09:58.490 --> 05:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
the point here is to uh make a Statewide
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
program so that a student who is in a
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
school system that is perhaps not so
 
05:10:05.090 --> 05:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
enlightened as to have that codified or
 
05:10:07.010 --> 05:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
has uh you know ambiguous or
 
05:10:09.170 --> 05:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
inconsistent policies on it which is
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
something I've heard about
 
05:10:13.010 --> 05:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
um would still have a option at the
 
05:10:14.448 --> 05:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
state level so it doesn't you know
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
depend on a particular principle
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.490 --> 05:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know when the the
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
you're using a couple of standardized
 
05:10:27.708 --> 05:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
tests as at the as the base level
 
05:10:30.288 --> 05:10:30.298 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the education that's
 
05:10:32.208 --> 05:10:32.218 align:start position:0%
required for a high school diploma
 
05:10:34.970 --> 05:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's locally created
 
05:10:39.650 --> 05:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
um is much more uh comprehensive than
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
just the evaluation of the math of the
 
05:10:44.090 --> 05:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
science of English literacy piece of a
 
05:10:45.890 --> 05:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
student's high school diploma and that
 
05:10:47.930 --> 05:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
would exclude that
 
05:10:49.490 --> 05:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
um by just using those standardized
 
05:10:52.368 --> 05:10:52.378 align:start position:0%
tests is a reason why you didn't make
 
05:10:54.830 --> 05:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
some some preparation or allowance for
 
05:10:57.770 --> 05:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
local impact there is
 
05:11:00.650 --> 05:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
um the goal here is to empower students
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
and their families and if there was a
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
situation where a school had a local
 
05:11:07.850 --> 05:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
requirement that you know all high
 
05:11:11.030 --> 05:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
school students need four years or to
 
05:11:13.610 --> 05:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
pass a certain test on the local County
 
05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
history or something like that that
 
05:11:18.170 --> 05:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
would then put the State Department of
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
Education in a position where it would
 
05:11:22.190 --> 05:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
have to tailor tests each individual
 
05:11:23.868 --> 05:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
Town knowing that you know oh in the
 
05:11:25.550 --> 05:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
John Stark School District there's a
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
particular requirement I think that
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
um there is a baseline level of
 
05:11:32.690 --> 05:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
Competency that we expect of a high
 
05:11:36.350 --> 05:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
school graduate and that can be uh very
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
well approximated by a Statewide testing
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
um uh system and uh you know right now
 
05:11:44.570 --> 05:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
we certainly allow people to achieve
 
05:11:46.010 --> 05:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
competency in a lot of different ways if
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
someone is homeschooled uh in the town
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
of uh haniker
 
05:11:52.128 --> 05:11:52.138 align:start position:0%
um that that they are not required to
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
pass any specific requirements that
 
05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
might be present in the public schools
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh in Henniker and in a similar way here
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
um if a student proves that they are
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
competent at the skills expected of all
 
05:12:04.970 --> 05:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
high school graduates uh yes just like
 
05:12:07.128 --> 05:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
uh with other educational choices uh
 
05:12:08.570 --> 05:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
either homeschooling or in a private
 
05:12:10.430 --> 05:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
school they might not meet some
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
particular requirements that has been
 
05:12:14.750 --> 05:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
imposed in that town and I see that as a
 
05:12:16.970 --> 05:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
feature uh not a bug
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further
 
05:12:20.930 --> 05:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
question representative Cornell thank
 
05:12:23.208 --> 05:12:23.218 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question I I
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
guess I don't understand on page one
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
starting with line 27 about any
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
non-profit Institution
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
must accept a passing grade from
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
matriculation so this student wouldn't
 
05:12:39.170 --> 05:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
have to apply to like the University of
 
05:12:41.090 --> 05:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and see if they got
 
05:12:42.530 --> 05:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
accepted or not they would just
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
automatically have to be accepted that
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
is not the intent of it and I would be
 
05:12:48.530 --> 05:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
happy to offer an amendment
 
05:12:50.448 --> 05:12:50.458 align:start position:0%
um what I was aiming for there and you
 
05:12:53.208 --> 05:12:53.218 align:start position:0%
know if you see the uh continuation on
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
line 31 shall not impose burdensome
 
05:12:55.440 --> 05:12:56.990 align:start position:0%
line 31 shall not impose burdensome
regulations

05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um so so that speaks to the intent I'm
 
05:13:00.288 --> 05:13:00.298 align:start position:0%
not saying uh that you are incorrect
 
05:13:03.170 --> 05:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
about the uh bill as written and I'd be
 
05:13:04.610 --> 05:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
happy to publish that to address that
 
05:13:04.620 --> 05:13:05.810 align:start position:0%
happy to publish that to address that
concern

05:13:05.810 --> 05:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
um the concern is uh that we would want
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that universities did not
 
05:13:13.490 --> 05:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know entertain some animus against
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
students who you know if there's some
 
05:13:17.810 --> 05:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
very gifted student to it 15 or 16 tests
 
05:13:20.090 --> 05:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
out that he is made to jump through
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
additional Hoops or de facto
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
05:13:24.360 --> 05:13:25.310 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
yeah

05:13:25.310 --> 05:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:27.530 --> 05:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you further question
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
05:13:31.730 --> 05:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think this could
 
05:13:34.128 --> 05:13:34.138 align:start position:0%
also possibly address the the concern of
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
the previous question so my um my
 
05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
reading of this shows that a uh a test
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
that would be designed that would be
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
based on a passing score on the task
 
05:13:48.410 --> 05:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
would be based on the average of high
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
school graduates my concern there would
 
05:13:53.330 --> 05:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
obviously be unfortunately high school
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
graduates are often not found to be
 
05:13:57.890 --> 05:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
competent when they go on to college
 
05:14:00.410 --> 05:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
they require remediation so I'm not
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily opposed to the concept but
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to instead perhaps
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
Peg the testing requirement to something
 
05:14:08.690 --> 05:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
like a higher percentile maybe an 80
 
05:14:10.730 --> 05:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
percentile or something along those
 
05:14:12.170 --> 05:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
lines to demonstrate that they have the
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
above average proficiency uh thank you
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
for the question that's a great question
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and I would certainly uh be amenable
 
05:14:20.990 --> 05:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
to offering an amendment to assuage that
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
concern uh what I was aiming here was
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
just to you know in the original draft
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
to explain myself uh to make sure it was
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
clear that students wouldn't be taking
 
05:14:32.270 --> 05:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
some sort of rubber stamp test that you
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
know gee I don't like high school let me
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
get out of here and uh that as a bare
 
05:14:37.970 --> 05:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
minimum they would have to
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
um demonstrate the same level of
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
competence as uh other high schoolers
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
but the intent is largely to unburden uh
 
05:14:47.810 --> 05:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
those students who are sort of eager for
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
more learning at an earlier age and feel
 
05:14:51.410 --> 05:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
sort of stultified with the local
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
options and so the group that you know
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
sort of I have in mind is very
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
compatible with a you know at least
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
eighty percent so I'd be happy to offer
 
05:15:02.208 --> 05:15:02.218 align:start position:0%
that Amendment thank you
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
I I have a question uh are you aware
 
05:15:07.850 --> 05:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
that for our high school students we
 
05:15:09.530 --> 05:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
have a phone call dual and concurrent
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment where we have many of our
 
05:15:16.250 --> 05:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
students now graduating from high school
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
with at least one year possibly two
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
years of associate degree under their
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
bills I am aware and I believe that this
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
is complementary to that
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and there's no reason that that
 
05:15:30.170 --> 05:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
couldn't continue I think that this does
 
05:15:32.448 --> 05:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
address uh different concerns
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:15:40.208 --> 05:15:40.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh yeah
 
05:15:42.350 --> 05:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
everyone's name
 
05:15:45.170 --> 05:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:47.628 --> 05:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
I can't quite figure out how to frame
 
05:15:50.330 --> 05:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
this question so bear with me
 
05:15:53.230 --> 05:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
I think in addition to what your
 
05:15:56.570 --> 05:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
proposing testing for
 
05:16:00.288 --> 05:16:00.298 align:start position:0%
students evolve between 13 and whenever
 
05:16:02.208 --> 05:16:02.218 align:start position:0%
they more traditionally finish High
 
05:16:02.218 --> 05:16:03.770 align:start position:0%
they more traditionally finish High
School

05:16:03.770 --> 05:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
School
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
and I would just submit that there ought
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
to be some assessment of
 
05:16:12.410 --> 05:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
maturity or Readiness to be in a
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
open environment
 
05:16:16.310 --> 05:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question uh I'd
 
05:16:17.690 --> 05:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
like to point out that there is nothing
 
05:16:21.288 --> 05:16:21.298 align:start position:0%
in here uh that is intended as I'm sorry
 
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
forget the term uh but the legal proof
 
05:16:26.090 --> 05:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
of adulthood so if a student tested out
 
05:16:28.490 --> 05:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
at the age of 13 and they said well you
 
05:16:29.930 --> 05:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
know my mom and dad I'm headed off to
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
Caltech uh that is still a 13 year old
 
05:16:34.730 --> 05:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
and Mom and Dad can say no you're not um
 
05:16:36.050 --> 05:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
you know you're staying right here
 
05:16:37.610 --> 05:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
because we know that you don't know how
 
05:16:39.550 --> 05:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
to set your own bedtime or get dressed
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
and so uh you know
 
05:16:44.810 --> 05:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
um citizens you know under the age of 18
 
05:16:46.250 --> 05:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
are still minors until they become
 
05:16:46.260 --> 05:16:51.128 align:start position:0%
are still minors until they become
adults

05:16:51.128 --> 05:16:51.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.810 --> 05:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh last question for me why did you set
 
05:16:58.010 --> 05:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
the bar so low in terms of
 
05:17:00.770 --> 05:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
it says accurately reflects the average
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire high school graduate the
 
05:17:03.360 --> 05:17:04.788 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire high school graduate the
average

05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
average
 
05:17:06.050 --> 05:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question uh
 
05:17:07.850 --> 05:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher asked the same
 
05:17:07.860 --> 05:17:09.050 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher asked the same
question

05:17:09.050 --> 05:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh I I thought it was a an
 
05:17:13.250 --> 05:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
excellent point and I said that I would
 
05:17:15.830 --> 05:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to offer an amendment the and I
 
05:17:17.628 --> 05:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
remind you that this is perhaps the
 
05:17:19.730 --> 05:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
first bill that I have uh tried to draft
 
05:17:22.368 --> 05:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm learning a lot
 
05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
um but my intent there was to assuage
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
concerns in the opposite direction I was
 
05:17:28.610 --> 05:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
coming at it from the perspective of you
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
know a teacher or members of the
 
05:17:32.208 --> 05:17:32.218 align:start position:0%
committee might say so you know they
 
05:17:33.770 --> 05:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
just have to take a test and you've got
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
no thoughts whatsoever about the
 
05:17:36.770 --> 05:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
standards so I said oh you know that's
 
05:17:38.090 --> 05:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
not true at all you've got to be at
 
05:17:41.090 --> 05:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
least uh you know as good as the average
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's entirely within the
 
05:17:45.050 --> 05:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
spirit of the bill to set that bar much
 
05:17:46.250 --> 05:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
higher and I'd be happy to offer an
 
05:17:47.930 --> 05:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
amendment for that and have you thought
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
of using an instrument like the act or
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
the SAT I uh specifically left it vague
 
05:17:56.090 --> 05:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
as to implementation and said that that
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
was up to the director of the Department
 
05:18:01.490 --> 05:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
of Education so that he could reuse an
 
05:18:04.490 --> 05:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
existing test which might allow for you
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
know zero incremental cost if there's a
 
05:18:08.090 --> 05:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
test that's already being offered he
 
05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
could merely set a bar on that
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:13.550 --> 05:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
for the questions thank you very much
 
05:18:20.270 --> 05:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.850 --> 05:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
okay so let's see I don't think you have
 
05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
any of these so we're going to have them
 
05:18:24.180 --> 05:18:26.690 align:start position:0%
any of these so we're going to have them
all

05:18:26.690 --> 05:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:28.730 --> 05:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
I assume that's all the students which
 
05:18:30.288 --> 05:18:30.298 align:start position:0%
we have here
 
05:18:40.490 --> 05:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:42.530 --> 05:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
you have a base no just press the button
 
05:18:51.230 --> 05:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:53.690 --> 05:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%

I support the bill
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%

05:19:58.730 --> 05:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
there you go yeah hello my name is Edwin
 
05:20:01.010 --> 05:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
Osborne I'm a homeschooler from Auburn
 
05:20:03.530 --> 05:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I support this Bill thank
 
05:20:05.570 --> 05:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
the one thing that really bothers me
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
about high school
 
05:20:13.448 --> 05:20:13.458 align:start position:0%
is that it's pretty useless
 
05:20:16.270 --> 05:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in this modern day and age
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
High School is used less as a way to
 
05:20:19.080 --> 05:20:20.690 align:start position:0%
High School is used less as a way to
educate

05:20:20.690 --> 05:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
educate
 
05:20:24.010 --> 05:20:24.020 align:start position:0%
children and more as either
 
05:20:27.050 --> 05:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
babysitting or a way for children to
 
05:20:28.850 --> 05:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
socialize with each other
 
05:20:31.010 --> 05:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
now this is discouraging for those of us
 
05:20:31.020 --> 05:20:32.708 align:start position:0%
now this is discouraging for those of us
who

05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
want to excel want to do well in school
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
because we have to deal with
 
05:20:41.510 --> 05:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's the whole distraction of the
 
05:20:45.050 --> 05:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.090 --> 05:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
public education just isn't great in
 
05:20:47.100 --> 05:20:48.590 align:start position:0%
public education just isn't great in
general

05:20:48.590 --> 05:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
even like private schools or a
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
homeschool learning Cooperative they
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
could have issues like this and I think
 
05:20:57.770 --> 05:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the children of our
 
05:21:00.288 --> 05:21:00.298 align:start position:0%
state it would be nice if we could test
 
05:21:02.448 --> 05:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
out of high school that way we could go
 
05:21:05.330 --> 05:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
about our you know our lives sooner we
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
could start going to college work more
 
05:21:10.970 --> 05:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
which would be really nice I'd love to
 
05:21:13.310 --> 05:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.320 --> 05:21:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:21:15.770 --> 05:21:15.780 align:start position:0%

have been homeschooled for my entire

life
 
05:22:02.090 --> 05:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
being homeschooled has allowed me to
 
05:22:05.690 --> 05:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
Deep dive into more of my interests and
 
05:22:07.730 --> 05:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
I was able to work and Excel at my own

I was able to work and Excel at my own

pace
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
currently I am a student at spark

taking college classes alongside my
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
normal high school classes as you
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier with dual enrollment
 
05:22:24.650 --> 05:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
dual dual enrollment I am currently a
 
05:22:26.208 --> 05:22:26.218 align:start position:0%
straight A student I am a student
 
05:22:28.250 --> 05:22:28.260 align:start position:0%

qualifying Vex robotics team
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
I find it cumbersome to follow the
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh age requirements that the other
 
05:22:38.448 --> 05:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
requirements of attendance despite
 
05:22:39.770 --> 05:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
knowing the correct most of the
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum curriculum being taught I
 
05:22:43.730 --> 05:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
believe students with the mental
 
05:22:45.170 --> 05:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
fortitude to test out of high school
 
05:22:47.390 --> 05:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
should be before the compulsory
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
attendance age or requirement ends
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
should have that opportunity allowing
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
students to acquire their High School
 
05:22:55.310 --> 05:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
degree before the age of 18 enables them
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of things that require
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
a high school degree sooner and begin
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
their career goals
 
05:23:03.650 --> 05:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
earlier in our society children are
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
infanticized instead of having
 
05:23:07.128 --> 05:23:07.138 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and earning respect a
 
05:23:08.570 --> 05:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
high school degree should be based off
 
05:23:09.948 --> 05:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
of the level of knowledge you possess
 
05:23:12.770 --> 05:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
instead of your age or credits earned I
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
would take advantage I would take
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of this opportunity by
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
continuing my deep dive into my
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
fascination with nuclear energy until I
 
05:23:22.490 --> 05:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
am able to join the Navy's nuclear
 
05:23:24.050 --> 05:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
energy technician program
 
05:23:25.730 --> 05:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
the more time I'm able to spend
 
05:23:28.490 --> 05:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
researching the more knowledge and the
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
more knowledge I can gain will set me
 
05:23:31.730 --> 05:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
apart from other candidates in the
 
05:23:31.740 --> 05:23:32.390 align:start position:0%
apart from other candidates in the
program

05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:23:34.250 --> 05:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate spark and its
 
05:23:36.650 --> 05:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
opportunities I would rather have my
 
05:23:38.208 --> 05:23:38.218 align:start position:0%
degree and spend more time taking
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
Unlimited College classes based on my
 
05:23:41.040 --> 05:23:42.350 align:start position:0%
Unlimited College classes based on my
passion

passion
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
in closing I believe that the bill is a
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
valuable opportunity for those who wish
 
05:23:47.810 --> 05:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
to get a head start on being successful
 
05:23:50.810 --> 05:23:50.820 align:start position:0%

working with several very talented high

school students who for whatever reason
 
05:24:29.930 --> 05:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
have not been successful
 
05:24:29.940 --> 05:24:30.650 align:start position:0%
have not been successful
um

05:24:30.650 --> 05:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
have not felt successful in traditional
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
learning environments and have come to
 
05:24:36.530 --> 05:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
us to
 
05:24:40.250 --> 05:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
try to learn in different ways and we
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
have found that many of these children
 
05:24:44.750 --> 05:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
have come to us
 
05:24:47.330 --> 05:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
with passions that they would like to
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
really explore but have been hindered by
 
05:24:52.010 --> 05:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
some of the legislation that exists for
 
05:24:52.020 --> 05:24:53.090 align:start position:0%
some of the legislation that exists for
them

05:24:53.090 --> 05:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment works sometimes
 
05:24:58.610 --> 05:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
for some kiddos they just want to take
 
05:25:00.890 --> 05:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
certain college classes and they aren't
 
05:25:02.810 --> 05:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
a they're Limited in what they are
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to take they're Limited in the
 
05:25:07.788 --> 05:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
requirements for taking them were they
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
able at the age of 13 or 14 or 15 to
 
05:25:14.170 --> 05:25:14.180 align:start position:0%
pass an exam
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
have a high school degree they would be
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
able to start deep diving into those
 
05:25:20.270 --> 05:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
passions while still living in their
 
05:25:22.550 --> 05:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
parents homes I did not talk to any one
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
of my students this morning when I told
 
05:25:26.448 --> 05:25:26.458 align:start position:0%
them I was coming up here to testify in
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
this bill not one of them said yes I'm
 
05:25:31.310 --> 05:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
moving out they were just really excited
 
05:25:33.410 --> 05:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
because often the kids who come to us
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
have come to us with really deep
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
passions and they just want to explore
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
them they just want to take as many art
 
05:25:43.788 --> 05:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
classes as possible without having to
 
05:25:45.530 --> 05:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
follow the high school standards that
 
05:25:47.990 --> 05:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
were set forth by Harvard University
 
05:25:51.470 --> 05:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
like 100 years ago we don't necessarily
 
05:25:53.448 --> 05:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
need all these years of all these
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
classes we need to revamp the high
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
school curriculum and in the place of
 
05:26:00.170 --> 05:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
doing that just let them test out of it
 
05:26:01.970 --> 05:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
so they can start doing what they want
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
one student who
 
05:26:09.170 --> 05:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
opted not to come today but did give me
 
05:26:12.230 --> 05:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
her opinion of the bill said she would
 
05:26:14.930 --> 05:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
support this bill because prior to high
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
school she was a straight A student
 
05:26:19.128 --> 05:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
she enjoyed learning she enjoyed her
 
05:26:21.708 --> 05:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
classes and when she got to high school
 
05:26:24.350 --> 05:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
the environment and the social pressure
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
was such that she began to fail all of
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
her classes
 
05:26:30.770 --> 05:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
and she felt awful
 
05:26:33.770 --> 05:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
and she didn't feel smart anymore she
 
05:26:37.490 --> 05:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
didn't feel good about herself anymore
 
05:26:40.250 --> 05:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
she now attends latitude and I'm so
 
05:26:41.570 --> 05:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
grateful that she does she's now
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
teaching at latitude and I am incredibly
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
proud of her and
 
05:26:51.530 --> 05:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
this bill would help children like her
 
05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:26:57.890 --> 05:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you and
 
05:27:04.208 --> 05:27:04.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.590 --> 05:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:27:08.930 --> 05:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee uh this is the last time I'll
 
05:27:10.550 --> 05:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
be up here today sorry I know you've
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
seen me a lot
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
um but I I saw this bill come up on the
 
05:27:16.490 --> 05:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
calendar last week and felt that I
 
05:27:18.590 --> 05:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
really wanted to speak on this and and
 
05:27:20.930 --> 05:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
give some thoughts uh this bill is
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
really designed to allow for students
 
05:27:25.250 --> 05:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
who feel like they've already met the
 
05:27:27.770 --> 05:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
requirements to have that chance to show
 
05:27:29.750 --> 05:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
and to prove to the rest of us that they
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
they do understand the material and they
 
05:27:34.128 --> 05:27:34.138 align:start position:0%
have mastered the content
 
05:27:37.368 --> 05:27:37.378 align:start position:0%
um current state law mandates that they
 
05:27:39.470 --> 05:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
must stay in the in the school system
 
05:27:42.288 --> 05:27:42.298 align:start position:0%
until they either drop out or they
 
05:27:44.810 --> 05:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
graduate and I think we've seen an
 
05:27:46.730 --> 05:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
increasing number of people very
 
05:27:48.350 --> 05:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
successful people especially in the tech
 
05:27:50.690 --> 05:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
industry who were high school dropouts
 
05:27:53.330 --> 05:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
and they dropped out largely because
 
05:27:55.128 --> 05:27:55.138 align:start position:0%
they felt like they either weren't
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
learning enough in school they didn't
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
have enough time to really pursue their
 
05:28:01.550 --> 05:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
passions uh issues with the
 
05:28:04.128 --> 05:28:04.138 align:start position:0%
socialization aspect of school and we're
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of these people go on to
 
05:28:08.510 --> 05:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
very successful careers and it kind of
 
05:28:11.090 --> 05:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
makes me wonder if these kids had had a
 
05:28:13.970 --> 05:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
chance to take a test and opt out how
 
05:28:15.530 --> 05:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
much more positive would their schooling
 
05:28:17.448 --> 05:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
experience have been with these kids
 
05:28:19.730 --> 05:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
rather than dropping out and either
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
pushing themselves and continuing on to
 
05:28:23.930 --> 05:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
highly successful careers there's the
 
05:28:25.550 --> 05:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
opposite of that there are the kids that
 
05:28:27.708 --> 05:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
do drop out and we don't know where they
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
go after if these kids were given an
 
05:28:31.730 --> 05:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show that they know the
 
05:28:35.030 --> 05:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
content they understand it and uh could
 
05:28:37.010 --> 05:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
test out of this I think it it would be
 
05:28:39.770 --> 05:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
really great to see the change and I
 
05:28:40.970 --> 05:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
think the difference that it makes in
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
some of these kids lives education is
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
really evolving at a rapid rate and
 
05:28:47.390 --> 05:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing new education opportunities
 
05:28:50.030 --> 05:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
come up every year and so I think we
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
really do have a fairly significant
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
group of students more than just one or
 
05:28:56.750 --> 05:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
two who would be looking for this as an
 
05:28:58.128 --> 05:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
option so that they could either get
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
started on a career they could go on to
 
05:29:02.510 --> 05:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
higher education but largely I think a
 
05:29:04.368 --> 05:29:04.378 align:start position:0%
lot of these kids want to explore their
 
05:29:06.288 --> 05:29:06.298 align:start position:0%
passions find out where they want to go
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
in life if they were able to graduate at
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
say 15 that gives a lot of time if you
 
05:29:14.330 --> 05:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
want to focus on art or music or history
 
05:29:16.250 --> 05:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
gives you a lot of time to pursue your
 
05:29:17.690 --> 05:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
passions and kind of figure out where
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
you want to go in life
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
um just to give a couple of examples
 
05:29:25.368 --> 05:29:25.378 align:start position:0%
I was looking through kind of the list
 
05:29:27.470 --> 05:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
of companies that were started by kids
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
that were high school dropouts and I was
 
05:29:32.690 --> 05:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
actually pretty surprised by some of the
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
the lists so we have the founders of
 
05:29:37.850 --> 05:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
Wendy's Coca-Cola Tumblr the Holiday Inn
 
05:29:39.410 --> 05:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
and McDonald's were all high school
 
05:29:41.868 --> 05:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
dropouts and so these people are going
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
on to lead successful lives but they
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
clearly were in a position in high
 
05:29:47.448 --> 05:29:47.458 align:start position:0%
school where they felt like their needs
 
05:29:49.128 --> 05:29:49.138 align:start position:0%
weren't being met so if we could give
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
students like that the opportunity to
 
05:29:53.208 --> 05:29:53.218 align:start position:0%
test out I think this would go a long
 
05:29:53.218 --> 05:29:54.590 align:start position:0%
test out I think this would go a long
ways

05:29:54.590 --> 05:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
ways
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so I think that uh this is a great
 
05:29:59.090 --> 05:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity like the bill sponsors
 
05:30:00.410 --> 05:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned before there are some things
 
05:30:01.850 --> 05:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
that he would address through the
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
committee so I think if we could work
 
05:30:04.970 --> 05:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
out some of those amendments uh this
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
would be a great opportunity for these
 
05:30:06.240 --> 05:30:07.010 align:start position:0%
would be a great opportunity for these
kids

05:30:07.010 --> 05:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:30:09.410 --> 05:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
05:30:12.530 --> 05:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
now senior thank you very much
 
05:30:12.540 --> 05:30:13.368 align:start position:0%
now senior thank you very much
um

05:30:13.368 --> 05:30:13.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mr fruit are you talking this bill
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay we have three eight here we've done
 
05:30:22.490 --> 05:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
that one so we're on 399 now so you want
 
05:30:25.970 --> 05:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
to talk at 399 yeah great thanks Jay
 
05:30:36.770 --> 05:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thanks to
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee for
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
allowing a couple of minutes to speak uh
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
first I want to acknowledge the prime
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
sponsors efforts uh to uh provide a
 
05:30:52.190 --> 05:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
variety of Pathways toward graduation
 
05:30:54.530 --> 05:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
and meet students needs to where they
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
are I also want to take a moment to
 
05:30:58.550 --> 05:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
commend the students who attended today
 
05:31:00.770 --> 05:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
to speak to this group it's a pretty
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
intimidating uh task it's intimidating
 
05:31:06.350 --> 05:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
to me and I'm a little bit older than
 
05:31:09.170 --> 05:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
most of them and so I want to just
 
05:31:13.010 --> 05:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their courage
 
05:31:15.050 --> 05:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
in the words of the Prime sponsor there
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
are several concerns and amendments that
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
would be required for this piece of
 
05:31:23.930 --> 05:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
legislation to move forward we share a
 
05:31:25.310 --> 05:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
number of the concerns that were brought
 
05:31:26.810 --> 05:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
out I won't take the committee's time
 
05:31:30.410 --> 05:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
reiterating those concerns but we would
 
05:31:32.810 --> 05:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
suggest that this bill would need
 
05:31:35.448 --> 05:31:35.458 align:start position:0%
further study either through interim
 
05:31:38.570 --> 05:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
study or a fine name and expedient to
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislate depending on the the nature of
 
05:31:44.090 --> 05:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
the committee but there are several um
 
05:31:45.890 --> 05:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
factors that need to be considered
 
05:31:47.810 --> 05:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
before this piece of legislation could
 
05:31:49.128 --> 05:31:49.138 align:start position:0%
move forward really in the best
 
05:31:50.690 --> 05:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
interests of kids
 
05:31:52.430 --> 05:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll conclude with that thank you
 
05:31:54.650 --> 05:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
very much any questions so the school
 
05:31:56.090 --> 05:31:56.100 align:start position:0%

representative leckis
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
um are there any that you could think of
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we haven't gone over just so we
 
05:32:04.368 --> 05:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
make sure and cover them
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
issues I will I thank you for the
 
05:32:08.330 --> 05:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
question representative like us I will

05:32:12.288 --> 05:32:12.298 align:start position:0%
paper and get those to you thank you
 
05:32:14.270 --> 05:32:14.280 align:start position:0%

further questions

thank you thank you and we have a card
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%

05:32:29.090 --> 05:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:30.890 --> 05:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman lad I almost said

know it's okay here today
 
05:32:37.490 --> 05:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh for the record Becky Wilson of New
 
05:32:39.890 --> 05:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association uh
 
05:32:41.570 --> 05:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
we will send in written testimony on
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
this bill we um appreciate obviously the
 
05:32:46.250 --> 05:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
sponsors and of course the students for
 
05:32:48.410 --> 05:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
bringing forward this bill to address a
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
very specific concern that they have and
 
05:32:53.030 --> 05:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
while the bill in its current form does
 
05:32:55.490 --> 05:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
not seem to directly relate to our local
 
05:32:57.890 --> 05:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
school boards as uh the conversation has
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
been happening with the number of people
 
05:33:01.010 --> 05:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
that have come to speak there's been
 
05:33:02.690 --> 05:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
many amendments that have been mentioned
 
05:33:05.690 --> 05:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to put on to the
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
record that nhsba would certainly oppose
 
05:33:10.970 --> 05:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
any amendments that would link this type
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
of program directly to students being
 
05:33:16.128 --> 05:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
able to obtain some sort of uh test
 
05:33:18.250 --> 05:33:18.260 align:start position:0%
result to get a local District
 
05:33:20.448 --> 05:33:20.458 align:start position:0%
designed in a locally approved diploma
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
by their local school board school
 
05:33:24.770 --> 05:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
boards invest an extraordinary amount of
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
time and care and development to
 
05:33:28.490 --> 05:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
determine what their graduation
 
05:33:29.868 --> 05:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
requirements are going to be at the
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
local level what the components are
 
05:33:34.368 --> 05:33:34.378 align:start position:0%
Beyond or to incorporate the minimum
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
standards and we've spent a lot of time
 
05:33:39.890 --> 05:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
over many many years and those of you
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
who've been on this committee for some
 
05:33:43.490 --> 05:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
time looking at course competencies how
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
students show competency having multiple
 
05:33:47.448 --> 05:33:47.458 align:start position:0%
opportunities to show their competency
 
05:33:50.750 --> 05:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
in a variety of ways and certainly one a
 
05:33:53.510 --> 05:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
one-time test would not meet for the
 
05:33:56.270 --> 05:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
most part locally District designed
 
05:33:58.250 --> 05:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
diploma requirements or graduation
 
05:33:59.810 --> 05:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
requirements that would lead to
 
05:34:02.448 --> 05:34:02.458 align:start position:0%
competency at that level so I'm happy to
 
05:34:04.128 --> 05:34:04.138 align:start position:0%
take any questions and that will submit
 
05:34:06.170 --> 05:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
some written testimony after thank you
 
05:34:07.788 --> 05:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%

05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
um school board and District who who
 
05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
would you suggest might be issuing such
 
05:34:19.730 --> 05:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
diplomas uh thank you for the question I
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
believe although you would have to ask
 
05:34:22.550 --> 05:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill that the current
 
05:34:24.170 --> 05:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
bill reports of the Department of Ed
 
05:34:26.810 --> 05:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
would be in charge of determining that
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome and Becky
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
during the years you've been in
 
05:34:32.448 --> 05:34:32.458 align:start position:0%
education I know
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
quite a few
 
05:34:36.350 --> 05:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
um have you ever dealt with Criterion
 
05:34:38.030 --> 05:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
reference tests or tests which deal
 
05:34:40.070 --> 05:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
specifically with curriculum that's
 
05:34:42.410 --> 05:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
required and you have to have multiple
 
05:34:44.030 --> 05:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
versions of these because you can't give
 
05:34:45.770 --> 05:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
the same version I'll have you ever
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
thought about what the expense would be
 
05:34:50.208 --> 05:34:50.218 align:start position:0%
to develop something like that or the
 
05:34:52.010 --> 05:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:34:52.020 --> 05:34:52.850 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

05:34:52.850 --> 05:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:56.510 --> 05:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think over time and over many years of
 
05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the way students show what
 
05:35:00.770 --> 05:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
they know there's been a lot of
 
05:35:02.810 --> 05:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
conversation about
 
05:35:04.788 --> 05:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
um one-time tests and whether or not
 
05:35:07.490 --> 05:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's a good valuation of what students
 
05:35:09.288 --> 05:35:09.298 align:start position:0%
actually know at a given time or whether
 
05:35:10.670 --> 05:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
or not they can apply the skills that
 
05:35:11.770 --> 05:35:11.780 align:start position:0%
they know
 
05:35:14.590 --> 05:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
yes we have many students who require
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations or modifications to
 
05:35:19.128 --> 05:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
certain one-time tests some tests
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
depending on the purpose of why you're
 
05:35:23.330 --> 05:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
giving the evaluation can and cannot be
 
05:35:25.730 --> 05:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
modified based on that but again if
 
05:35:27.650 --> 05:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a you know to try
 
05:35:29.090 --> 05:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
to come up with some sort of equivalency
 
05:35:32.510 --> 05:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
like the GED or the hiset exam or the
 
05:35:34.970 --> 05:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
sat there are very limited modifications
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
and accommodations that can be made to
 
05:35:38.090 --> 05:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
those things and it requires quite a bit
 
05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
of documentation ahead of time if you
 
05:35:42.170 --> 05:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
are going to make any requirements but
 
05:35:44.448 --> 05:35:44.458 align:start position:0%
again those don't lead to a district
 
05:35:47.930 --> 05:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
level diploma so that would be where we
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
would want to draw some sort of
 
05:35:52.670 --> 05:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
Distinction thank you you're welcome
 
05:35:52.680 --> 05:35:55.128 align:start position:0%
Distinction thank you you're welcome
representative

05:35:55.128 --> 05:35:55.138 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't know whether you know
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
the answer to this question but you
 
05:36:02.090 --> 05:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
brought up the GED and it reminded me
 
05:36:05.930 --> 05:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
that when my kids took their geds they
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
had to wait until their High School
 
05:36:11.628 --> 05:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
their class in their High School would
 
05:36:14.448 --> 05:36:14.458 align:start position:0%
have graduated but somebody said that
 
05:36:16.368 --> 05:36:16.378 align:start position:0%
that had changed and I was wondering if
 
05:36:18.890 --> 05:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
you knew what the current rules around
 
05:36:20.448 --> 05:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
the gedr
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I'm sorry
 
05:36:23.470 --> 05:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
I can't see
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't see you
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
um I would have to look specifically for
 
05:36:30.410 --> 05:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
those very further criteria for that
 
05:36:31.910 --> 05:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative there are age
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
requirements I believe to take the high
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
set it's called now that's the noon
 
05:36:37.128 --> 05:36:37.138 align:start position:0%
version of the GED
 
05:36:38.690 --> 05:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and there may be some age
 
05:36:40.128 --> 05:36:40.138 align:start position:0%
requirements for that or a certain
 
05:36:41.990 --> 05:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time that you have to have
 
05:36:43.368 --> 05:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
been enrolled at the high school level
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
or something to that effect before you
 
05:36:46.850 --> 05:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
can take the GED but I would have to I
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
mean that I said I would have to check
 
05:36:49.368 --> 05:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
on that
 
05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I just I don't think it's
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
related to your cohort necessarily but I
 
05:36:55.850 --> 05:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
do think it may be related to age okay
 
05:36:58.190 --> 05:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I was just hoping you might
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
know I can look it up as soon as I get I
 
05:37:03.890 --> 05:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
appreciated thank you thank you very
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
much Becky any further questions
 
05:37:09.650 --> 05:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
have a good evening thank you
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
so this uh I think it's all the cards
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
we've had on that bill and we have two
 
05:37:15.050 --> 05:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
cards in the next bill and then we're
 
05:37:15.060 --> 05:37:17.150 align:start position:0%
cards in the next bill and then we're
done

05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to close this hearing
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:31.920 --> 05:37:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
.

05:37:54.590 --> 05:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:54.600 --> 05:37:56.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:37:56.770 --> 05:37:56.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:37:59.330 --> 05:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
hb45 is establishing a committee to
 
05:38:01.490 --> 05:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
study student loan forgiveness in New
 
05:38:03.650 --> 05:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I like to welcome
 
05:38:07.310 --> 05:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:19.368 --> 05:38:19.378 align:start position:0%
yeah you go ahead thank you so much Mr
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh members of the committee
 
05:38:25.010 --> 05:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh today I'm introducing uh hb45 which
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
is a study committee to investigate
 
05:38:30.250 --> 05:38:30.260 align:start position:0%
student loan debt in New Hampshire
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh so the state of New Hampshire has a
 
05:38:34.610 --> 05:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
serious problem when it comes to what
 
05:38:36.288 --> 05:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
its Workforce will look like in the next
 
05:38:39.650 --> 05:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
15 years our Public University system is
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
one of the most expensive in the entire
 
05:38:44.208 --> 05:38:44.218 align:start position:0%
country uh in our state our students are
 
05:38:45.830 --> 05:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
paying the price at almost thirty
 
05:38:47.930 --> 05:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for in-state tuition
 
05:38:49.150 --> 05:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
and fees
 
05:38:51.650 --> 05:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
this disincentivizes students from
 
05:38:54.288 --> 05:38:54.298 align:start position:0%
attending in-state universities and
 
05:38:56.570 --> 05:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
contributes to our state's brain drain
 
05:38:58.910 --> 05:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
High School grads are leaving our state
 
05:39:01.430 --> 05:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
for cheaper options and out-of-state
 
05:39:04.850 --> 05:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
students are finding it often unable uh
 
05:39:06.530 --> 05:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
to live here because of High Cost of
 
05:39:08.650 --> 05:39:08.660 align:start position:0%
Living uh
 
05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is one of the
 
05:39:15.890 --> 05:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
second oldest states in the nation and
 
05:39:17.570 --> 05:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
our a lot of our Workforce will be
 
05:39:19.810 --> 05:39:19.820 align:start position:0%
retiring in that next 15 years
 
05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
while at the same time we are unable to
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
retain a lot of our students uh
 
05:39:29.448 --> 05:39:29.458 align:start position:0%
but I I did this is not official data
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
but in a private study published in 2021
 
05:39:34.368 --> 05:39:34.378 align:start position:0%
I saw that upwards of 75 percent of high
 
05:39:37.070 --> 05:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
school grads could be leaving the state
 
05:39:41.208 --> 05:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
for higher education elsewhere uh so it
 
05:39:44.090 --> 05:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
would be a good point to have this study
 
05:39:45.948 --> 05:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
committee look into exactly how many
 
05:39:48.970 --> 05:39:48.980 align:start position:0%
students are leaving our state
 
05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh with because of a lot of uh people
 
05:39:55.250 --> 05:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
not wanting to necessarily stay here
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
after they uh leave College uh we need
 
05:40:00.770 --> 05:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
to start looking at solutions for this
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
problem uh or else our state is going to
 
05:40:06.470 --> 05:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
suffer uh because of a lock a loss of
 
05:40:06.480 --> 05:40:07.730 align:start position:0%
suffer uh because of a lock a loss of
Workforce

05:40:07.730 --> 05:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
05:40:10.970 --> 05:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm asking all of you to please
 
05:40:12.770 --> 05:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
join me in supporting the creation of
 
05:40:14.030 --> 05:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
the study committee so that we can
 
05:40:16.190 --> 05:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
clarify the statistics and create a plan
 
05:40:18.530 --> 05:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
that will benefit our state and our
 
05:40:20.448 --> 05:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
students thank you thank you very much
 
05:40:26.510 --> 05:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:26.520 --> 05:40:32.330 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:40:32.330 --> 05:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:35.150 --> 05:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
there you go good thank you chairman uh
 
05:40:36.530 --> 05:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for waiting
 
05:40:36.540 --> 05:40:37.310 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for waiting
around

05:40:37.310 --> 05:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
um but I have no problem with the
 
05:40:41.208 --> 05:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
essence of what you're trying to do my
 
05:40:43.550 --> 05:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
concern is the membership
 
05:40:45.890 --> 05:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we found out a year
 
05:40:48.470 --> 05:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
or two ago uh when they were looking at
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
student apps to finance the the broad
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
study of
 
05:40:55.368 --> 05:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
expenses for Education whether the
 
05:40:56.690 --> 05:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
college is public schools that they
 
05:40:58.250 --> 05:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
needed some of the financial backgrounds
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
versus just legislators yeah uh and I
 
05:41:03.050 --> 05:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
would think that would be uh
 
05:41:05.390 --> 05:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
value here as well and the other one is
 
05:41:07.490 --> 05:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
I would suspect we should be wonderful
 
05:41:08.270 --> 05:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
to have someone from the University
 
05:41:08.280 --> 05:41:09.770 align:start position:0%
to have someone from the University
level

05:41:09.770 --> 05:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:41:11.208 --> 05:41:11.218 align:start position:0%
um dealing with this all the time has a
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
better or an additional uh view so I'm
 
05:41:16.490 --> 05:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
just I'm just suggesting if if you had
 
05:41:19.128 --> 05:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
for a reason those were put in there or
 
05:41:20.390 --> 05:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
you hadn't thought of them or you're
 
05:41:22.310 --> 05:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
just happy with what you have
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
so uh of course representative Schultz
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh is the prime sponsor on this bill and
 
05:41:30.170 --> 05:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know necessarily what her
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
intent was on that
 
05:41:35.868 --> 05:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
um but I I again we could talk about an
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
amendment if that would uh be suitable
 
05:41:41.690 --> 05:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman you're welcome
 
05:41:43.250 --> 05:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
05:41:44.810 --> 05:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so just looking at
 
05:41:50.330 --> 05:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
the idea of creating a student loan
 
05:41:53.090 --> 05:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program my understanding of
 
05:41:55.970 --> 05:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness being that really the
 
05:41:58.250 --> 05:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
pre the person who can forgive alone is
 
05:42:00.770 --> 05:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
really the person who holds the loan
 
05:42:02.810 --> 05:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
um given that the debt in these cases I
 
05:42:04.610 --> 05:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
believe would be to universities because
 
05:42:06.830 --> 05:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
somebody attends the university they
 
05:42:09.288 --> 05:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
they take out the money to go there
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is is this is the
 
05:42:14.810 --> 05:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
intent of this to be looking at things
 
05:42:17.270 --> 05:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
like for instance the University of New
 
05:42:18.770 --> 05:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire last I looked as an endowment
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
of one billion dollars or is the intent
 
05:42:23.150 --> 05:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
only to look at obtaining These funds
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
um so that's a good question again the
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
point of a study committee is to look at
 
05:42:31.730 --> 05:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
different uh approaches to this
 
05:42:33.708 --> 05:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
legislation and so that we can try to
 
05:42:38.170 --> 05:42:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:40.430 --> 05:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:42:42.288 --> 05:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
were you familiar are you familiar at
 
05:42:44.628 --> 05:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
all with the granite guarantee program
 
05:42:48.050 --> 05:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
a slightly yes I'm uh I'm currently a
 
05:42:50.448 --> 05:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
student at UNH and uh I'm I'm on the
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
granite guarantee uh so it is a useful
 
05:42:56.270 --> 05:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
program but it does not necessarily go
 
05:42:58.610 --> 05:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
far enough for a lot of students
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so there are some additional concerns
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh because many of the people who are
 
05:43:05.390 --> 05:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
above the threshold will uh actually be
 
05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
a part of the uh the grant guarantee may
 
05:43:09.650 --> 05:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be able to afford the
 
05:43:11.208 --> 05:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
university system here
 
05:43:12.610 --> 05:43:12.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno
 
05:43:16.970 --> 05:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
05:43:18.890 --> 05:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
very much representative Howard for uh
 
05:43:21.470 --> 05:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
for for being with us this afternoon
 
05:43:25.250 --> 05:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
um tangentially related to um uh to
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
hospital 45 uh uh was wondering if you
 
05:43:31.070 --> 05:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
may have had a chance or maybe we'll
 
05:43:34.250 --> 05:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
have a chance down the road to um to
 
05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
take a look at some work that was done
 
05:43:40.670 --> 05:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
um in a committee to study a state
 
05:43:42.410 --> 05:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
guarantee of refinancing of student
 
05:43:45.230 --> 05:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
loans and explore the possibility of tax
 
05:43:47.090 --> 05:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
credits for businesses that offer
 
05:43:49.368 --> 05:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
tuition forgiveness that's the title of
 
05:43:51.890 --> 05:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
the study committee it was done back in
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
2019 and it came out of Senate Bill 139
 
05:43:57.350 --> 05:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I just put it out there as reference
 
05:44:00.110 --> 05:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
that that the committee did hear
 
05:44:02.448 --> 05:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony again it's not
 
05:44:04.368 --> 05:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
spot on to what you're looking at here
 
05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
but there may be some relevant pieces
 
05:44:09.590 --> 05:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
and obviously a lot has happened between
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
2019 and where we are today that
 
05:44:15.890 --> 05:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
probably were not picked up on on during
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
during you know during the pandemic and
 
05:44:21.410 --> 05:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
so uh so I think there may be some good
 
05:44:23.990 --> 05:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
um good nuggets in here
 
05:44:26.090 --> 05:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
um Senator chandley chaired that
 
05:44:27.890 --> 05:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
committee and I served on it along with
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hill
 
05:44:32.810 --> 05:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I I haven't had a chance to uh look
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
at that uh so if you'd be as kind enough
 
05:44:37.610 --> 05:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
to send that over I appreciate it Happy
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
to do that thank you thanks
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:46.970 --> 05:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:46.980 --> 05:44:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:44:52.010 --> 05:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.690 --> 05:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I figured you started
 
05:44:54.770 --> 05:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
your day with me you might as well
 
05:44:56.810 --> 05:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
finish with me as well
 
05:44:58.850 --> 05:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
um I am representative Lauren selig from
 
05:45:01.310 --> 05:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
Durham New Hampshire and I was speaking
 
05:45:03.410 --> 05:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
with representative Howard about this
 
05:45:06.530 --> 05:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
study committee and why it makes sense
 
05:45:07.788 --> 05:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
um I happen to be the parent of a high
 
05:45:09.530 --> 05:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
school senior and those of you who've
 
05:45:11.090 --> 05:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
been through the process are probably
 
05:45:13.010 --> 05:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
familiar with the joy of applications
 
05:45:16.670 --> 05:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
which we have thankfully just completed
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
um my daughter is now filling out all
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
the applications for scholarship as well
 
05:45:23.150 --> 05:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so we're a family that wouldn't
 
05:45:25.010 --> 05:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
qualify for Granite State progress for
 
05:45:25.020 --> 05:45:26.030 align:start position:0%
qualify for Granite State progress for
example

05:45:26.030 --> 05:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:45:29.150 --> 05:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
um my daughter is ultimately did submit
 
05:45:30.830 --> 05:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
an application to the University of New
 
05:45:30.840 --> 05:45:31.788 align:start position:0%
an application to the University of New
Hampshire

05:45:31.788 --> 05:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:45:34.490 --> 05:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
um she wasn't going to but she had no
 
05:45:36.890 --> 05:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
hesitancy in applying to the universe to
 
05:45:39.230 --> 05:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
one of the SUNY colleges
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
um and she applied to it because she
 
05:45:42.530 --> 05:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
kept getting ads and then actually did
 
05:45:43.730 --> 05:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
research and discovered that it would
 
05:45:46.490 --> 05:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
cost her less paying full tuition as an
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-state student at any of the SUNY
 
05:45:48.840 --> 05:45:49.910 align:start position:0%
out-of-state student at any of the SUNY
colleges

05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
including going for a master's degree I
 
05:45:53.810 --> 05:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
believe then going for four years at the
 
05:45:55.490 --> 05:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire living in my
 
05:45:57.410 --> 05:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
house since we're only a mile away
 
05:45:58.970 --> 05:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
now my daughter is currently taking
 
05:46:01.070 --> 05:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
classes at UNH we have the benefit of
 
05:46:03.470 --> 05:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
that as as Oyster River residents
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that the college
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire is the worst
 
05:46:10.670 --> 05:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
funded State University in the country
 
05:46:11.930 --> 05:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I happen to be working there when
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
their budget was cut in half by 50 I no
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
longer work for them as a result of that
 
05:46:20.330 --> 05:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
um and so the the expectation that we
 
05:46:22.128 --> 05:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
place on our young people and the burden
 
05:46:24.470 --> 05:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we pay place on our young people to
 
05:46:26.930 --> 05:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
pay tuition there and then also to
 
05:46:28.730 --> 05:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
support the cost of living which in the
 
05:46:30.110 --> 05:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
Seacoast of New Hampshire is some of the
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
highest in the country is unsustainable
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
and so I support the creation of the
 
05:46:37.010 --> 05:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
study committee so that we can have a
 
05:46:39.770 --> 05:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
more thorough and complete understanding
 
05:46:42.048 --> 05:46:42.058 align:start position:0%
of the different aspects of the
 
05:46:43.490 --> 05:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
penalties that this is causing about the
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
way in which it's leading to I mean I
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
would say if my my kiddos friends
 
05:46:50.390 --> 05:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
um 95 are applying to out-of-state
 
05:46:50.400 --> 05:46:51.650 align:start position:0%
um 95 are applying to out-of-state
schools

05:46:51.650 --> 05:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:46:53.208 --> 05:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
um and many of them are doing that in
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
order to save money
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and we obviously would rather keep
 
05:46:58.610 --> 05:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
them keep them closer to home if they
 
05:47:00.530 --> 05:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
would be willing to do that thank you
 
05:47:01.850 --> 05:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:47:01.860 --> 05:47:04.010 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

05:47:04.010 --> 05:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:47:07.610 --> 05:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:47:10.128 --> 05:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
um I I'm it's not immediately obvious to
 
05:47:13.490 --> 05:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
me what the Nexus is between
 
05:47:15.670 --> 05:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
um studying for striking student loans
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
versus increasing funding for
 
05:47:21.048 --> 05:47:21.058 align:start position:0%
universities can you speak that just a
 
05:47:24.410 --> 05:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:27.410 --> 05:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
in in my personal opinion I think by
 
05:47:29.930 --> 05:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
studying the way in which we loan money
 
05:47:31.548 --> 05:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
to students and the way in which they
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
need support to repay those loans
 
05:47:36.650 --> 05:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
um and where there is some State funding
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
and there are some federal grants and
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
other kinds of things that can be repaid
 
05:47:41.690 --> 05:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
there are also a number of predatory
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
loans that that get to students but we
 
05:47:46.190 --> 05:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't have a full understanding of the
 
05:47:47.448 --> 05:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
different types of loans and the
 
05:47:48.770 --> 05:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
different ways that students pay for
 
05:47:51.890 --> 05:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
school and pay for all of their things
 
05:47:53.208 --> 05:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
um and and we need a greater
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
understanding we we have um
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
two or three food pantries in Durham
 
05:48:01.548 --> 05:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
um and one of them is primarily to serve
 
05:48:03.470 --> 05:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
as students who can't afford to eat
 
05:48:06.110 --> 05:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
while they go to school so I think
 
05:48:09.170 --> 05:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
understanding really the level of debt
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
that our students carry that is pretty
 
05:48:14.090 --> 05:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
unique to you to New Hampshire residents
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
is something we really need to be able
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
to understand and by having a study
 
05:48:19.730 --> 05:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
committee that can look at those
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
different things and how loan
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
forgiveness can then allow them to go on
 
05:48:25.850 --> 05:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
to living here hopefully being able to
 
05:48:27.650 --> 05:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
buy a house and put down long-term
 
05:48:29.570 --> 05:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
permanent routes to
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
um you know hopefully become teachers
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
and fulfill our our desperate need for
 
05:48:35.810 --> 05:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
teachers in our school system or any of
 
05:48:39.410 --> 05:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
the other jobs we have a very high job
 
05:48:41.208 --> 05:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and not a lot of people
 
05:48:44.510 --> 05:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
left to keep filling those jobs
 
05:48:47.090 --> 05:48:47.100 align:start position:0%

05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so much I
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%

05:48:59.270 --> 05:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:45.368 --> 05:50:45.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.128 --> 05:50:57.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
