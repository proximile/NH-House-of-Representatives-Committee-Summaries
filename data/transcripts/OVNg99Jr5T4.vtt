call the work session to order
 
00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh turn our attention to uh sb 401
 
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
i think this should uh
 
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
go relatively easily since
 
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at the amendment
 
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 align:start position:0%
which um
 
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.749 align:start position:0%
which um
[Music]

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 align:start position:0%
which replaces everything other than the
 
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.510 align:start position:0%
which replaces everything other than the
um

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
opening statement
 
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
which is where the the money is um
 
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
which is where the the money is um
appropriated

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
i think we've had plenty of discussion
 
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
on these um
 
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
bridges and roads and dash cams and
 
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
that would cause an issue
 
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
so if i could uh
 
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to have a motion to accept
 
00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.750 align:start position:0%

motion yesterday
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
status of this is itl
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
six to one
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
and uh the reason
 
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.590 align:start position:0%
and uh the reason
that

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
the vote was this way is because
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
in our opinion we had
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
two offices trying to accomplish the
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
and um that was
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's not something i could allow to
 
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.629 align:start position:0%
that's not something i could allow to
happen

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%

the parents whether the advocate gets
 
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.630 align:start position:0%
the parents whether the advocate gets
involved

involved
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
access to records and whatever
 
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.949 align:start position:0%
access to records and whatever
or

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
the record of special education that is
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%

awaiting a performance audit now
um

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.269 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
by testimony it was just so dismal that
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
i expect the advocate to be advocating
 
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
i expect the advocate to be advocating
actively

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
actively
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
with the school districts
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
who are denying services for
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
specious reasons
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
so they'll be basically able to subpoena
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you want to use the world yes in
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
other words they and now the parents
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%

now they're they're
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
they're there to see to the special
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
education needs
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%

it's a interesting office

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.430 align:start position:0%

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
i know that in your testimony
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
that you had indicated or your whether
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
it was you or someone else
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
had indicated that um
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
was charged with this
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
special education problem
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
we do have jurisdiction over education
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
as well correct yes and that was updated
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
in december 2020. okay so
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
does your office have any great problem
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
if we remove that from your office yes
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
the main issue with that is that we do
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
serve children
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
in all aspects and
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
i know that there has been discussion
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
around us specifically working with
 
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
around us specifically working with
children

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the juvenile justice system
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
involved with dcyf which yes that is one
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
aspect of what we do and an important
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
aspect of ensuring all children across
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the state are serviced appropriately we
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
do need to be able to have access to
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
their education records as well that is
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
part of the whole child and we look at
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.170 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.069 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
these two offices could certainly work
 
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.069 align:start position:0%
these two offices could certainly work
together

00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
they could um i think there's a lot of
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
concern around that in the current
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
office for myself specifically
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
it is confusing already the systems that
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
are in place in regards to education for
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
families and to navigate a system where
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
we could be working in one respect and
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
another office could be potentially
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
duplicating that or working in a
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
different respect on
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to the same family can be
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
quite confusing so we'd like to reduce
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
that if possible we do feel that having
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
the specialty within the office could
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
serve the need and meet the needs of the
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
families we are at no point denying that
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
there is a need for a special education
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
advocate and there is a need for the
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
specialty within our office but we do
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
feel it's best served communication wise
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
and to be a clear office under one roof
 
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.550 align:start position:0%
and to be a clear office under one roof
okay

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from anybody
 
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.389 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from anybody
else

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
yes so we have responded to the bill
 
00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
yes so we have responded to the bill
that

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
we are in support to a degree but we are
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
not in support of this being a separate
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
office so we have provided um a finance
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
financial write-up of what it would cost
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
to add this
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
this role to our office versus the
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
financial note of having a separate
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
independent office right thank you yes
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay i do have a couple of just
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions that
 
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:54.150 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions that
yes

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
if i
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
understand what i'm hearing from many
 
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
understand what i'm hearing from many
people

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
they don't believe
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
right wrong or indifferent
 
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.670 align:start position:0%
right wrong or indifferent
that

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
your office has been um
 
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
your office has been um
successful

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
in resolving problems
 
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.310 align:start position:0%
in resolving problems
that

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
families have
 
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.829 align:start position:0%
families have
and

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:27.189 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
is it because
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
you're tasked with
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
is it because you're overwhelmed
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
or is it some other reason
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a complex question
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
yes i know i know um and and so i think
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of answers to that um i
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
think we've been clear that when it
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
comes specifically to special education
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have the resources in the
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
office to meet that need right now so
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
that is a big piece of it is having the
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
resources available within the office
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
i think as well um some
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
a piece of this bill
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
that i've been concerned about all along
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
is what is the expectation what do
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
families truly believe the advocate can
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
do we do not have authority to override
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
iep decisions
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
we do have the ability to educate
 
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.550 align:start position:0%
we do have the ability to educate
families

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
to help them work through the process to
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that they understand the
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
process and are taking the steps
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to be able to meet their
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
child's needs but
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
by no way is this advocate position even
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
if it is an independent office is this
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
position going to be attending iep
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
meetings with every single family are
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
they going to be overriding decisions
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
that are being made so
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
my concern is is that
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
families are believing that that is
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
with this bill and
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
our office does not have the ability to
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
do that we can make recommendations to
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
to school systems to the department of
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
education on better ways to to manage
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
some issues when we have specific
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
complaints about a family we can do a
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
deeper investigation into where the
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
system failed that family and make those
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations but no office of special
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
education advocate or of the child
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
advocate has the authority to override
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
decisions that are made
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't wanna i don't wanna say
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
something that's uh that's wrong
 
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.310 align:start position:0%
something that's uh that's wrong
um

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
i guess from my perspective
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.029 align:start position:0%
at this point
that

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
i would prefer
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
to not
 
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.470 align:start position:0%
to not
put

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
this advocate
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
into your office
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
if we find
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
within the next
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we're having
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
problems with this
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the two offices not
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
being able to work together or
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know if it isn't working or whoever
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
is appointed the advocate isn't working
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
then i think that um
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
we could legislatively
 
00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:32.150 align:start position:0%
we could legislatively
certainly

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
special education committee
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
is a special education
 
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.669 align:start position:0%
is a special education
people

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:50.230 align:start position:0%
people
are

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
i don't even know what
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
word to use are totally opposed if
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's the right term
 
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.430 align:start position:0%
that's the right term
to

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
this office going into
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
your office at this time
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many emails i've
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
received or
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
comments or
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
attacks in the hall
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
from my from my perspective
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
i think that it's probably the best
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
thing to do right now
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
is to set up a separate office
 
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
is to set up a separate office
and

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:32.890 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.190 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
we'll work just make sure that
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
whoever is
 
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.590 align:start position:0%
whoever is
appointed

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.190 align:start position:0%
appointed
understands

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
understands
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
that one of their responsibilities
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
is working with you because that is
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
very very important
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
you cannot do your job or your advocacy
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
i guess is is what that is i
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
i don't like advocates but that's okay
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's just me
 
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.510 align:start position:0%
that's just me
um

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
but that's that's sort of how
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
from uh represent buco thank you madam
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%

special ed is fraught
with

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
with
difficulties

um
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
i used to be a special ed teacher
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
special administrator worked at the
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
department of education and in
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
before i was deputy commissioner i had
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
special ed was my field
 
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
special ed was my field
um

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's a personal situation it's hard and
 
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.830 align:start position:0%
it's a personal situation it's hard and
difficult

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.789 align:start position:0%
difficult
um

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
your office
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
i applaud because you
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
in you're new to your role first of all
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
back away from casting any judgment on
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
your office because you're new
 
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.350 align:start position:0%
your office because you're new
and

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that the former advocate
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
knew she needed extra help
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
and for me
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
the special ed advocate would be
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
a wonderful
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
asset in your office because so many of
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
the issues are a stem in special
 
00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:02.070 align:start position:0%
the issues are a stem in special
education

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.029 align:start position:0%
education
so

00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that i would like to see
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
work together
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
and and come up with a great plan
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
of of how to work better with school
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
districts and the department of ed
 
00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:17.909 align:start position:0%
districts and the department of ed
because

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on in special ed
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of new changes there are
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of new laws
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
the funding is is at the local level is
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
always difficult
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i just i would feel better
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
with one office working together um to
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
address these issues i just think it's
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
it would be a coordinated effort and
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
more powerful
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:45.669 align:start position:0%
that's my
feeling

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.149 align:start position:0%
 
people

00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh do not want the special education
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
advocate in this office
 
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.269 align:start position:0%
advocate in this office
for

00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
and miss sanchez is here now
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
talking about why
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
it should remain within
 
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.549 align:start position:0%
it should remain within
the

00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate
 
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate
so

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's i think
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:26.070 align:start position:0%
okay and
yeah

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
i know that we uh
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
won't be able to vote on this because we
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
don't have the amendments
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
but i just want to make sure
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
that we have a
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
good airing and understanding
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
it is it's important
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
so just quick question i'm assuming this
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
hearing just got in the way and ms
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
sanchez was your first
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
to test no um
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
senator reagan introduced what he was
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
going to um okay put in the uh in what i
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
assume we will be hearing from other
 
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.230 align:start position:0%
assume we will be hearing from other
individuals

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
well i don't know
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't you know the the issue
 
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.870 align:start position:0%
you know i don't you know the the issue
is

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
the issue was that i had
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
two offices
 
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.830 align:start position:0%
two offices
that

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.710 align:start position:0%
that
okay

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so what this does is take what the
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
amendment will do
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
is take that responsibility away from
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
and put it into the special ed thing
 
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.510 align:start position:0%
and put it into the special ed thing
so

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
that allows for two offices
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
and ms sanchez is arguing against that
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that's uh certainly if i may
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just happy we're doing the advocate
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
because i think we need to do that um
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not gonna
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
get stuck on one office or another um
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
if somehow within the amendment we could
 
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.830 align:start position:0%
if somehow within the amendment we could
um

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
get in coordination
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
um so that we know there is um
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
that you folks will be working together
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
my preference would be
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
the one office
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
because i think advocate
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
says a lot
 
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
says a lot
but

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
certainly um i can live with either way
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think the important thing is the
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
advocate position and i'm happy to
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
support that so i am flexible
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
i am also flexible
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
position are there any other questions
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
yes uh reps and uh thank you madam chair
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
um i'm just
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
trying really hard to suss out you know
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
and um they're just things in my head
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
that i guess i'd like to put out there
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
for other discussion or to
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
people to help me to understand um the
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
first is uh mr sanchez is new in this
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
and so it's hard to predict what's going
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
to what that office is going to look
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
like going forward and some of the
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
issues that occurred in the previous
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
situation may not pertain so there's
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
part of me that would like to see more
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
coordination uh with the two and there's
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
some sense in my head that this
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
would fit well under there um but again
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
with miss sanchez being new to the
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
position we don't know what that's going
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
to look like i also look back you know
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
we their first um
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to put an interim study
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
which we said no and then we moved to
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
itl the whole thing and now we're back
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
to passing the whole thing and i'm just
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
feeling a little
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
lost and a little bewildered about how
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
we've gone from interim study to itl to
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
now this should be a good thing and
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
where should it lay
 
00:28:57.279 --> 00:28:58.870 align:start position:0%
where should it lay
well

00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
the itl was because we had
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
it we had
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
okay
that

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
were trying to do the same thing
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
that was what the itl was all about time
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
to understand that with the amendment
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
pulling education out of the child
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
advocates office and special ed becoming
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
a separate um because i also
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me you know i can be fine
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
with that but it seems to me that part
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
of advocacy in with children kind of
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
involves education
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i have a hard time understanding the
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
limit of the child advocacy office if
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
that office doesn't have to do with
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
education that kind of
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
limits significantly what they would be
 
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.430 align:start position:0%
limits significantly what they would be
doing

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
maybe ms sanchez can speak a little bit
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
to that but i feel it's a little
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
confusing to me that would have a child
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
advocate office that does not deal with
 
00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:54.630 align:start position:0%
advocate office that does not deal with
education

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes so that is a main concern
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
of mine we do treat as a as i mentioned
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
prior we do treat the holistic view of
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
the child which encompasses their
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
education um their leisure activities
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
their mental health their physical
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
health so as of right now in in the
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of the extension of our
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in december 2020 was for
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
that very purpose because we saw those
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
limitations and we had those limitations
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
and we were not able to do to treat the
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
whole child and to help advocate for the
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
whole child when those limitations were
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
set so it would be highly concerning
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
that we would not have the ability to
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
access necessary records for children
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i had mentioned that
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
there is an understanding that our scope
 
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.269 align:start position:0%
there is an understanding that our scope
covers

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
covers
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
children in dcyf custody children
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
involved with the dcyf system children
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
involved in juvenile justice but i have
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
understood yes i've only been here for
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
two and a half weeks and in my two and a
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
half weeks the first thing that has
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me is the fact that there
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
is a lot of education to be done on what
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
our office can and should be doing
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
i absolutely have it in my agenda to be
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
able to reach out to school districts to
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
connect with them to connect with the
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
department of education as one of the
 
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.470 align:start position:0%
department of education as one of the
primary

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
roles is stepping in
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
i understand that that has not been
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
built up yet and that relationship is
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
extremely important to be able to do the
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
work that we know is a limitation of our
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
office that was highlighted during the
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
strategic planning within our office and
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
that was something that was asked of me
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
coming in if i was willing to take on
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i would like to be have the
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take that on and i i do
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
that our it will be
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
setting back our entire office and the
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
work that they how far they have come
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
we've only been here for four years and
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
there has a lot of work been work that
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
has been done within those four years
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
and this will greatly set us back on
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
that work
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
yes could someone speak to the other
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
side of that certainly
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay senator reagan
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
in the creation of the come up come up
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
do you have any further questions oh
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
we'll be back with you
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
in the creation of
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
sb 381
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
mention was made of the office of the
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
proved

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
proved
 
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
proved
that

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
that was not something that they did
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
that they were active in or had any
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
successes in
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
and so we never thought about it
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
in the same area
 
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.230 align:start position:0%
in the same area
until

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
at a
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
later hearing
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden appears the oca to say
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
well we already do this when we already
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why and every
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
reasoned person who has reviewed this
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
has agreed that this should be in a
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
separate place
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
with us it has a separate purpose
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
so the office of the child advocate was
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
created because of children that were in
 
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.190 align:start position:0%
created because of children that were in
danger

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
danger
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
and we thought this was
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate the problems with children who
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
are in danger
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
the special education is a whole other
 
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.990 align:start position:0%
the special education is a whole other
world

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's a whole different area of
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
service to children
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're not the same because they both
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
say advocate
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
they're entirely separate
 
00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.029 align:start position:0%
they're entirely separate
areas

00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i can understand that
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
it became obvious that the office of the
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
was eager to get their hands on the
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
money proposed in the special education
 
00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:49.990 align:start position:0%
money proposed in the special education
advocate

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
and add positions
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
but that's just
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
in a management term it's empire
 
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.190 align:start position:0%
in a management term it's empire
building

00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
they're not in any conflict
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe there's anything
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
lost by them each doing their separate
 
00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.669 align:start position:0%
lost by them each doing their separate
missions

00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
missions
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
and they should go about doing what they
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
were intended to do
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
and we expect that this special
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
delve deeper into
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
the problems that we have with special
 
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.109 align:start position:0%
the problems that we have with special
education

00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.470 align:start position:0%
education
so

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have the binder with me now but
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
there's a four inch binder at the
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
performance audit and oversight
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
committee with testimony
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
and i could say
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
in that whole four inch binder and it's
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
full of testimony there's not a happy
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
the child advocate had they wanted to
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to do it they just
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator oh yes you may
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
just uh just to make it a little more
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
confusing in the beginning of this
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
bill here
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
it says that the
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
advocate will be attached to the
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
right that was an attempt at neutrality
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
and that's not that's not an unusual
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
thing as a matter of fact the office of
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay so it's and that seems to be the
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
they attach them
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
no responsibility
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
for them other than to find a other than
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
to find a place for them to um
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
surely

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
surely
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
so senator thank you for taking my
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
question i guess that i want to make
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
sure that i'm understanding your
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
position if i understand it
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
you you agree that there should be a an
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh an advocate for special education but
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
it should not fall within the
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the
 
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.470 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the
uh

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
rsa21v right
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
and and but that advocate for special
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
education should also be housed in the
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
it it's wherever the ais can find office
 
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
it it's wherever the ais can find office
space

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
so i i guess i'm sure if i can't ask to
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
follow so i guess i'm
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
sorry you already are so i guess i'm
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
logically it would seem since one is in
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
the office of administrative services
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know for neutrality reasons as you
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
say which may make sense the office of
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
the child special of the special
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
education advocates should be in
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
administrative services and i'm just
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if we have
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
if we have both of them in there
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more efficient really to
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
just have one one uh
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
office doing
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know doing gold let me just make a
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
comment okay
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
when it says it's um
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
assigned to das it's only for
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
administrative purposes in other words
 
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.790 align:start position:0%
administrative purposes in other words
it's

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
finding them a place a room
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
getting them a telephone
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
they may be located in um transportation
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
because that's who has the space
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
or safety or someplace they won't share
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
an office yeah they won't share an
 
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.349 align:start position:0%
an office yeah they won't share an
office

00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
so oh go ahead no i'm so gonna say but i
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
mean if they're
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
if somebody isn't doing
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
whether it's in in the uh in the um
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh office of the uh of the 21v
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
child advocate or the special education
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.630 align:start position:0%
child advocate
who

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
i mean who's their supervisor who who
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
who decides you know if they're doing
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
their job or not doing their job the
 
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.150 align:start position:0%
their job or not doing their job the
governor

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
so the governor is the supervisor of
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
both of them
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the end
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor of all the executive agencies
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so okay all right
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
miss sanchez i believe uh represent
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
turcotte has a couple of questions for
 
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.270 align:start position:0%
turcotte has a couple of questions for
you

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if i may i would like to address the
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
supervision as well that's possible
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
so we have an oversight commission
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
that works to oversee and to ensure that
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
we are meeting our mandate so ultimately
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes the governor appoints the position
 
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
but there is a separate oversight
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
commission that is in place to ensure we
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
are meeting our mandate
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
and so my
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
my guess if this was created as a new
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
office there would need to be a new
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
oversight commission for that office as
 
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.349 align:start position:0%
oversight commission for that office as
well

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question um i
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
believe i know you're fairly new in the
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
position but i heard
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
could you either elaborate or repeat the
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
comments you made
 
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.470 align:start position:0%
comments you made
about

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
sounded to me like you were admitting
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
that the current
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate has been
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
what you're supposed to be doing did i
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
hear that correctly
 
00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.150 align:start position:0%
hear that correctly
so

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.430 align:start position:0%
so
if

00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
i can start from the beginning um so we
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
we received this new jurisdiction in
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
december 2020.
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
um within that time frame we were also
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
within the strategic planning process so
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
the prior child advocate along with the
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
oversight commission and outside
 
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
oversight commission and outside
stakeholders

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
went through the strategic planning
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
process to see what pieces of the
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
mandate they were meeting what they
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
would like for goals for the future
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
and what parts of the mandate they were
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
not meeting the pieces of the mandate
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
that they were not meeting were in
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
regards to this newer jurisdiction but
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
the office had existed without that
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for some time so the focus
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
was really at that point
 
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.550 align:start position:0%
was really at that point
unfortunately

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a pandemic was
 
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a pandemic was
developing

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
developing
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
this aspect of the jurisdiction which
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
includes special education so it was
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
understood at that time of strategic
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
planning which it is now that that was a
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
shortcoming of the office that that was
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
an area of focus for the future of the
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
office to build that up since that had
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
not been
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
achieved thus far by the office so i
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
inherited the office with that being a
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
primary goal to build the relationships
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
of the department of education to
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
outreach communities school districts
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent's offices so that
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
families understood this role in our
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because that was the other
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
missing piece was that families were not
 
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.589 align:start position:0%
missing piece was that families were not
aware

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
that we had oversight and education that
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
we could assist with special education
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
so it was it's getting out informing the
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
public informing the community meeting
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
with families and ensuring that they
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
know they can call our office file a
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
complaint and we will look into
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
whether the department of education is
 
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.710 align:start position:0%
whether the department of education is
meeting

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
their guidelines for this family and
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
then to be able to follow up with the
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
department of education and
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
through relationship building make
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations for them to make
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
improvements on behalf of these families
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
and that is something that i have taken
 
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.990 align:start position:0%
and that is something that i have taken
on

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
and am very willing to do with this
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
um

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
so if this new office
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the advent kit for special education
 
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.750 align:start position:0%
of the advent kit for special education
um

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
would you be able to accomplish that
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
with current staffing or would that
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
require you adding additional staff and
 
00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
require you adding additional staff and
whatever

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so that was something else that was
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
found within the strategic planning was
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
that the resources in the office do not
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
have the specialty for special education
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
so we would be looking to add to the
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
office which is what we provided um in
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
in a letter that i sent you which would
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
be the finance for adding the position
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
to the office and we would look to add
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
specifically a staff member with special
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
education law background
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
because that that in itself we have
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
learned throughout the community that
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
special education law is very convoluted
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
and it takes a specialty to understand
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
parents rights within that so we would
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
be looking to add that as well as
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
a support staff for that
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
special education advocate who has that
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
law background
 
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.270 align:start position:0%
law background
yes

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for ms
 
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.950 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for ms
sanchez

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
is there thank you thank you yep just
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
we really enjoy meeting you this morning
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you i appreciate your time
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have the opportunity
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
if this bill wasn't here
 
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.710 align:start position:0%
if this bill wasn't here
uh

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're gonna focus on
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
what we're focusing on
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
most definitely okay thank you thank you
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh glenn cordelli representing
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
first of all i i think it would be bad
 
00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
first of all i i think it would be bad
policy

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
to mix
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
special education services in with an
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
office that is
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'll say centered on
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
dcyf and juvenile justice
 
00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:01.349 align:start position:0%

we've heard discussion about
 
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.430 align:start position:0%
we've heard discussion about
jurisdiction

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
and i'd point you to the office of child
 
00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:09.589 align:start position:0%
and i'd point you to the office of child
advocate

00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%

21 v section
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the definitions
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
agency means any department institution
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%

00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
or the division of children youth and
 
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:36.870 align:start position:0%
or the division of children youth and
families

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's no magic
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know you can argue about whether
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's jurisdiction over the department
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
of education
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
um and i think that the attorney general
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
has said that they do
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
in my discussions with the lawyer for
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
but i'd point out
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the department of education
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
provides no direct services to children
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's all done at the local level local
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
school districts provide those services
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
those special education services
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
so i see nowhere in here
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
that the office of the child advocate
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
would have the ability or the authority
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
into the local school district level
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
their responsibility is at the state
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
department level
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
so in terms of jurisdiction i think that
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
there would be no jurisdiction for the
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
current office of the child advocate
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
advocate to get into the area of special
 
00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:38.790 align:start position:0%
advocate to get into the area of special
needs

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
services provided
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
represent turka thank you madam chair
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli for
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh you were in the
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
room when miss sanchez just talked about
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word specialist to
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
handle because it's so much different do
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
you agree that the
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a large difference between the
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocacy and what
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposing
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes i would
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned that
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
special education services is a unique
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
and difficult area and certainly
 
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.829 align:start position:0%
and difficult area and certainly
requires

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
specialized um
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge and information um
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
about both federal and state law
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
child advocate as has said um they do
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
not have that expertise right now in
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
their office and would have to hire
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you madam chair um
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for the additional question so
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
would it be your
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
your position that
 
00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:00.710 align:start position:0%
your position that
um

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
having the two separate
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
now i don't want to call them
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
departments but whatever it would be
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
called the two different advocacy groups
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
since money would have to be spent
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
either way to develop this
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
new department
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's placed under here
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
or as its own in a department that's
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
more specialized for the purpose
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
if the money's going to be required
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
either way
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
is it your position that it's better to
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
segregate it into its own
 
00:47:34.079 --> 00:47:35.190 align:start position:0%
segregate it into its own
department

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
most definitely i think
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
definitely it needs to be its own
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
separate office um and within the office
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
except me under the jurisdiction of the
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
who uh it is my understanding would
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
preserve a
 
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.710 align:start position:0%
preserve a
pro

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
pro
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
provide services such as payroll and
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
things like that um would come from uh
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's why these types of offices are
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
placed there
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone else that wants to
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
talk about this mary uh represent heath
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
um you had a question yes i do um thank
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
you sorry
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
special education has a process and if a
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
complaint is filed at the department of
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
ed there's a number of things that can
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
happen and it rises to various levels
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
where in that interaction would you see
 
00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:33.349 align:start position:0%
where in that interaction would you see
the

00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
special education advocate
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.549 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
381

00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
381
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
provides certain duties for
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
the proposed new office
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
similar in many regards to the
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the current child
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
advocate office
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
receiving complaints and investigation
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
i would see that
 
00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:07.109 align:start position:0%
i would see that
the

00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
office of
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for special needs would work
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
with the department
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
if they found problems and so forth
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
just like the office of child advocate
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have no ability to overturn
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
the findings of an iep team at the local
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
district level
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
but would be able to look and see if
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
there are patterns
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
of problems
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
being at the district level or
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state amongst districts
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
problems in the processes and recommend
 
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.069 align:start position:0%
problems in the processes and recommend
solutions

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i think the
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
the outline of functionality for the
 
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.990 align:start position:0%
the outline of functionality for the
office

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
is a starting place and we can see
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
as the office develops
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.150 align:start position:0%
you know what
revisions

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
revisions
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.030 align:start position:0%
may be
required

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
and other functionality added to the
 
00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:06.710 align:start position:0%
and other functionality added to the
office

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
to ensure that
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
parents needs are being met
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
just follow up
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
certainly in relation to
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
the uh mandates that come from idea and
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
our own state plan
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i would definitely see that they
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
would be always up to date on changes to
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
idea or
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%

special needs i have four children of my
 
00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.309 align:start position:0%
special needs i have four children of my
own

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
and i am very proud we are talking only
 
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.470 align:start position:0%
and i am very proud we are talking only
about

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
381 no
 
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
381 no
no

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
whether this office should be separate
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
or it should be under
 
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.549 align:start position:0%
or it should be under
the

00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
sure uh child advocate sure okay okay we
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
we don't i mean i know you have a story
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
and that's wonderful but
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
but we that's not what we're here for
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay so in terms of distinguishing this
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
from being part of the child advocates
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
office i think we've already heard with
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that was previous and i'm
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that you all had access to that
 
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.910 align:start position:0%
hoping that you all had access to that
testimony

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
we've come up a number of times many of
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
us that are parents who work jobs who
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
have these kids with special needs we've
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
provided a plethora of this evidence as
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
to why this needs to be distinguished so
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that you receive that i did
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
send some of that to you we have some 90
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
pages of a 700 person petition that was
 
00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.829 align:start position:0%
pages of a 700 person petition that was
signed

00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
signed
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's one reason right there this
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be different
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
many of us have had encounters working
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
with some of these agencies state
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
agencies who have no knowledge of things
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the ground level so you just heard a
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
little bit from senator uh
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli about
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that this is something at the
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
district level okay so there's a very
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
intensive process that we go through um
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
as parents to understand what this
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
process is and that's part of what led
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
us here
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i would beg this committee to ask
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
some of those specific questions i'm in
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
software engineering i work with
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
executives i go into meetings all the
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
time asking for funding i would never
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
dream of going in asking for funding
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
without understanding anything about
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
this process so i would like to leave
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
that with you all today
 
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.950 align:start position:0%
that with you all today
so

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
so first of all knowledge is a problem
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
area okay
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
expertise we've heard of that before
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
from others
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
um i beg to ask the question if this
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
person even understands what proficiency
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
scores are for special education in new
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire for our kids 36 000 of them
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
that have ieps these are regular kids
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
okay non-ieps iep children are in single
 
00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
okay non-ieps iep children are in single
digits

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
digits
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
what we're after okay i
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
all this plays into that well we all
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
underst well
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
most of us have a really good
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of special ed and what the
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
problems are great because that's one of
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
the areas that we fund
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
in the budget so we have asked i think
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the world so may i ask you a question
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
have you attended an iep meeting ever
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes as a matter of fact yes how many
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we're one like i said we're
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
we're familiar with it so so it needs to
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
be separate because we already have pic
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
we already have the we already have the
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
dra we already have all of these empires
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
that have grown in mushrooms and we got
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
here today because we need something
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
different okay reason why i bring up
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
software engineering is when we have a
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
defect in that life cycle we fix it
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
early and often we don't let it
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
propagate to just add on more
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy is not going to fix that
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
defect problem here so we need to do
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
something radically different and when i
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
testified last time to that house
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee i said
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
i i would be you know quite all right
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
with hiring a consultant out of nowhere
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
hire somebody that's going to do some
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
something radically different for this
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
state because the situation we're
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
finding ourselves in is we continue to
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
mushroom it's not going to matter if
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
we're spending 500 000 we're going to be
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
facing class action lawsuits against the
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
from the parents and the concerned
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
parties in the state who did do it in
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
texas and they'll do it here too so i
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
would hope that that should be something
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're paying attention to also we need
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
to do something radically different in
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
this case we need to test and learn and
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
not do the same stuff all over again
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's my rationale for doing something
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
different okay thank you thank you just
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
a moment
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
someone may have a question
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
stopping keeping it focused
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative madam chair so is it your
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
position that you believe these two
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
offices should be separate and not
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
together yes or no
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you're welcome
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative buko uh thank you madam
 
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.030 align:start position:0%
representative buko uh thank you madam
chair

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're pretty deep into the
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
policy here um
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
the only financing that i see in this
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
bill is the five hundred thousand to
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
establish the office
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
and my in my office
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
only because the amendment that we will
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
be looking at this afternoon
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
removes the
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
child advocate from
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
well it sets up a separate office
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
and removes responsibility for education
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
from the office of child advocate that's
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
why it sounds like we're into a lot of
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
policy issues
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:01.589 align:start position:0%
but that's
that's

00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
that was the reason why we idled it in
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
the first place and and
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
and if i may follow up how did that come
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the from the policy committee
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
did they pass this it came to us from
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
the policy committee as a separate
 
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.349 align:start position:0%
the policy committee as a separate
organization

00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
 
00:56:32.559 --> 00:56:33.829 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
um

00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
comments would you like
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
tell us tell us who you are
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%

with many other parents i have called
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
the former child advocate begging for
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%

children that i've helped in rochester
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
whose families are obligated to sign a
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement by the law firm
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
of drummond and woodson with their
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
lobbyist jerry zellen
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
gagging parents under ndas
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
so that they can't share their story
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
without threat of lawsuit
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
this is what's going on in education in
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire our own taxpayer dollars
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
hold on okay i'll i'll
 
00:58:27.839 --> 00:58:28.870 align:start position:0%
hold on okay i'll i'll
last

00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
our own taxpayer dollars that we pay
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
are then paid to these highly paid law
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
firms wildly star and peter peters i
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
think anne drummond and whitson to fight
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
against our kids with disabilities so
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
how does that affect who
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
so the yeah so that's okay whether this
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
must be it must be separate because many
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
parents and myself have called a child
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
child advocate they do zilch nothing
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
with education particularly nothing with
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
special education
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay so it must be separate for any
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
change to be done in new hampshire
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate it thank you so much
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
and again i don't you know i'm not
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
cutting you off but
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
i can take questions but i really want
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
to focus on what our
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
discussion is all about
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
yes you may ask a question i i
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you very much for
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
taking the question and i appreciate
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
believe me i appreciate your you know
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's obviously you're very frustrated
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
and i completely understand that
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
the thing i i guess i'm a little bit
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about is this and both you and
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
the prior witness testified about this
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
you've sort of said
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
given the picture that you know the
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
school districts are not sort of doing
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
their job they're not handling these
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
things the way they should be and and i
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
think your witness would testify before
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
you said and there's a there's a whole
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
lot of other people that have tried to
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
get involved and they're not doing it
 
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.589 align:start position:0%
get involved and they're not doing it
either

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
i guess that what the question that that
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
raises to me is
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
how do we know that this you know we're
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
going to form a new
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh sort of inspector general for a lack
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
of a better term
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
for special education
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
how do we know they're going to do their
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
job either if all these other
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
places aren't doing their job why should
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
who are you know state or local
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
officials that are
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
you know presumably well intentioned how
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
do we know that this agency is going to
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
be the
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
the magic one that will do the job greg
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
because firstly
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
families and the students are going to
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
come first for the first time in
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
education history of new hampshire the
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
lobbyists the unions these hardly paid
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
law firms they're not going to have any
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
influence the families and the children
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
are actually going to say these are the
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
problems that we're having to the
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
advocate they're actually going to do
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
data tracking to say okay darlene
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
gildersleeve from hopkinton new
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire had two different child
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
children that were denied educational
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
evaluations she had two different
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
children that were denied their fair and
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education which is
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
also known as fate under the federal law
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
there they're also going to be told that
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
i mean we have another bill right now sb
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
394 in
 
01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:16.710 align:start position:0%
394 in
hb1513

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
hb1513
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
that darlene gilder steve's son was
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
kicked out of school and kicked off his
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
iep when he was 21 so he couldn't
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
graduate high school and the mom had me
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
i had to go and beg a charter school to
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
take him so the differences with this
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
advocate is families and children are
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually going to be heard and listened
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
to and put first
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be the buying
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
difference and keeping the office
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
separate is the key
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
because that's how we guarantee that
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes you may so in the in the example you
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
gave i mean when you say that that the
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate is going to
 
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.190 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate is going to
be

01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh for the for special education is is
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to be is going to receive the
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
complaint i mean isn't
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
isn't it the situation that
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to they're going to get
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
the complaint and they're going to say
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know mr x or ms ms x has complained
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
that their child was
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
was for lack of a better term
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
not properly treated in some respect
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
aren't they going to also
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
call the other side aren't they going to
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
call the school and say well wait a
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
minute that's what
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
this person claims is that true or not
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's actually going to be proof the
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
family keeps their own records
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
there like senator regan said
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
files of exactly what happened files and
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
files and files binders and binders of
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
complaints then we get trends we get
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
data tracking and then this child
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
advocate will work of special ed will
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively with commissioner
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
edelblut and the governor and not try to
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
write reports attacking them but say
 
01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:00.549 align:start position:0%
write reports attacking them but say
listen

01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to do these are the this is
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do and these are the
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
solutions and listen to the families of
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
the children who are experts in our
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
children with our medical professionals
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
and our reports and our records and all
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
of our experience
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
then we could say this is the real story
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to let the lobbyists
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
speak for the school districts anymore
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
at three to five hundred dollars an hour
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
the parents and the families are going
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
to be hurt
 
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.670 align:start position:0%
to be hurt
okay

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up no no i but
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay maybe
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
yep let me get representative edwards a

01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to avoiding that
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so so i'm representative
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
jess edwards auburn chester and sandown
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
also a member of the finance committee i
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
i i wasn't part of this bill
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
until very recently i got involved
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
because i had a large number of people
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
contacting me my background includes
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
being a manpower officer in the army
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
in which i i did manpower analysis and
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
organizational redesign and design on a
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
number of occasions so just to address
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.349 align:start position:0%
your question
should

01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
this office be
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
co-located within the existing office or
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
should it become a separate independent
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
office the kind of factors that you
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
would look at in order to help make that
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
decision would be
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
is is the mission aligned are the two
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
missions aligned well enough to where
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
the central leadership of that
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
organization would be able to
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
parse out
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
what kind of support is needed for each
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the missions that's one aspect
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
is is it um a case where
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
um there there may be sort of um a
 
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.789 align:start position:0%
um there there may be sort of um a
natural

01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
natural
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
motivation to focus on one side of the
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
mission at the detriment of the other
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
and if that exists
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh by
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
paying short shrift to the other side of
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
the mission
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh does that do some substantial harm
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's just another issue of
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
just workload i mean if if if we didn't
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
have to worry about
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
specializations of missions
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
prioritization of organizations
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh and workload
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
the entire federal government would be
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
one department
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know but but because we care about
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
these things we we tend to uh segregate
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
and segment
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh listening to the arguments um from
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
the representatives and senators that
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
looked at this i think they came to the
 
01:06:04.079 --> 01:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
looked at this i think they came to the
conclusion

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
that just as a matter of policy there is
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
good cause to me to establish this
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
office in a separate and distinct way
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
to representative lin's question about
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
well if we create a new office will they
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
be as feckless as we perceive the others
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
to have been and i i would say
 
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.309 align:start position:0%
to have been and i i would say
that

01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
we need to keep distinct the the
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
an organizational design
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the and the personnel that are used
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
to staff it
 
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.910 align:start position:0%
to staff it
um

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i once had a senior boss basically
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
just rip up my plan for a reorganization
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
because he said this is all about people
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
if you don't if you don't have the right
 
01:06:49.119 --> 01:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
if you don't if you don't have the right
people

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
in the right spot
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
what kind of design you have so so as
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
important as that is it's a distinct
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
thing from
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
how you design it to begin with
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
so just i if it i it sounds like it
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
should become a separate office and that
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
the higher the new hire should be really
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
good um so that's that's those are my
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead thank you madam chair
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question so i
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
understood everything you said is it
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
your position that you believe that the
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
uh representative
i

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
i i tend to have an opinion on
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
everything i i try to
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
highlight the ones that i really think
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
i've done my homework on and really or
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
have reached a conclusion
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh i i this one i'm sort of still
 
01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.190 align:start position:0%
uh i i this one i'm sort of still
gelling

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
gelling
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
i i i think i'm 80 percent confident
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
that keeping them separate uh or
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
establishing an independent office to
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
advocacy for education that that is
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea
 
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:10.850 align:start position:0%
but i i i i can't swear it to you
 
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:12.069 align:start position:0%
but i i i i can't swear it to you
[Music]

01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
so so am i
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
hearing you right that although you're
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
straddling the fence a little bit most
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
of your body's on one side of it on the
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
leaning towards segregating the
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get it clear
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes sir 80 of my body is on one side of
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
the fence and that that's a lot of body
 
01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:35.110 align:start position:0%
the fence and that that's a lot of body
so

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
unless there were other questions no
 
01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:41.590 align:start position:0%
unless there were other questions no
okay

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.390 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
should we bring the microphone to you
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay i think he turned the microphone
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
off so just press the little squiggly
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
button there
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%

01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
the soffit the office no well no no well
 
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.870 align:start position:0%
the soffit the office no well no no well
or

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
what you have
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
the offices should be separate thank you
 
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
the offices should be separate thank you
um

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.669 align:start position:0%
um
because

01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
special ed law experience
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
not only do they need
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
special ed law experience
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's a very unique
 
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
it's a very unique
position

01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
they need special education
 
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.270 align:start position:0%
they need special education
experience

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
they need to know
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
about disability
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know the disability world they need
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
they need to understand
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know the iep process in itself
 
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.709 align:start position:0%
you know the iep process in itself
is

01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
an entirely different language
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
i do have printouts for you
 
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.390 align:start position:0%
i do have printouts for you
for

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
that includes all of the acronyms for
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:55.189 align:start position:0%
special ed
which

01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
i think that you would it's 11 pages i
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
think long
 
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.149 align:start position:0%
think long
so

01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
i just thought it would give you an idea
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
of i mean it takes a long time to learn
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
that language
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
so when you're a new parent going into
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
that world it
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's quite overwhelming and you
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
you really don't know i mean the school
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
district has
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
power over you because you really don't
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
know what people are saying to you
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
so and so when i when i
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
i know so sorry but when i hear that
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
um ms sanchez doesn't have any
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
experience in special ed
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's very concerning
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
because um
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know obviously she would be
 
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
you know obviously she would be
overseeing

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
overseeing
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
the person in her office
 
01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.070 align:start position:0%
the person in her office
and

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know she would be
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
it would be very concerning
 
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
it would be very concerning
um

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
this person would also need to have um
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know experience with medical
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
diagnoses because they would be
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
overseeing and reading reports
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
they need to understand assessments they
 
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
they need to understand assessments they
under

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is is that if i if
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
i could just kind of
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
get us back
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
you feel
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
you believe that
 
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.590 align:start position:0%
you believe that
the

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
person that the governor selects with
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
all of these criteria
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
would be better off in their own office
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
i do um i think that it is
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
it is just
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
an enormous position
 
01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.550 align:start position:0%
an enormous position
um

01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
in itself
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
the other concern that i have is that ms
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
sanchez testified
 
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
sanchez testified
um

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
last week that
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
if there were
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
problems to arise that she would
 
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
problems to arise that she would
uh

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
go to the department of ed and to pick
 
01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.070 align:start position:0%
go to the department of ed and to pick
and

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
the whole point was to flush out
 
01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
the whole point was to flush out
problems

01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
independent of those
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
entities so
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know those we were trying to
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
be independent of that so
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
mickey has provided uh oh
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
with the not yet
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
i think that uh
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recess until
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
like one o'clock or a little after
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
to give us
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
to

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
digest all of this
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
we'll come back at that time and make
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
make a decision yes ms sanchez
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if i can respond
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i'm not available to come
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
back at one o'clock as much as i would
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
love to be able to be back here okay
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
so just a couple of points um to clarify
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
and and notes that i took from
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
those that that spoke after me
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
um i would like to note that we do
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
currently have staff in the office
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
that track data and trends for our
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
office for whatever we are looking for
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
data trends at that point um so do we
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
have the capacity in the office already
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
to track data trends in education if we
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
are getting complaints in regards to
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
education yes we do
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
we're not getting complaints with
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
education right now because we're not
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
known as i had noted earlier but if we
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
were known and understood to families
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we also worked in that capacity i
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
do feel that we have the capacity in the
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
office to track those trends and the
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
specialists that we would be looking for
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be then to take a look at those
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
trends and see what recommendations will
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
be made from that
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
um also i would like to note that i have
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing that there are parents in
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
the room who have children with autism
 
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum diagnosis that falls
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
under children's behavioral health we
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
already work in the scope of children's
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
behavioral health we work very closely
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
with that and again like i said when
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the holistic view of
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
the child
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
education is one piece of that and of
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
course special education is extremely
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
important and access to services for
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
children with autism spectrum disorder
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
services in school are extremely
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
important and we understand that in the
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
office so having that specialist to work
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
on that at the special education aspect
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
would only enhance what we are already
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
doing on the child behavioral health
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
side in regards to those diagnoses
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
and then i would like to just note for
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
the room that i by no means would call
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
myself a specialist in in special
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
education i take nothing away from these
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
families who work very very hard to get
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
their children to where they are
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
have i been able to experience special
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
education in the state of massachusetts
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
where i come from yes i have i've
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
interacted with that system quite a bit
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
i've seen some great things that the
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
system's doing i've seen some flaws in
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
that system as well and my hope would be
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
with bringing the specialist in the
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
office would possibly be able to bring
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
some of my experience from state that is
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
doing some things well in special
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
education and advocate for that here in
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%

conversation about the governor
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
appointing that's already in the
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
underlying bill which is why it wasn't
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%

all right is there any discussion
 
02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
all right is there any discussion
uh

02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
let me just say this okay
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh obviously i'm gonna vote otpa okay
 
02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:31.670 align:start position:0%
uh obviously i'm gonna vote otpa okay
that's

02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
neither here nor there
 
02:20:33.359 --> 02:20:34.150 align:start position:0%
neither here nor there
but

02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
i do think that um the education
 
02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
i do think that um the education
committee

02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
needs to re-look at this
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
in a couple of years to see how
 
02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
in a couple of years to see how
effective

02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
effective
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
this organization is
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
it is standalone
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to take some time for the
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
governor to appoint somebody
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
this lady here seemed really efficient
 
02:20:59.439 --> 02:21:00.309 align:start position:0%
this lady here seemed really efficient
and

02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
knew exactly what needed to be done but
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether the governor will
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
appoint her
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
but um you know i i do think that it's
 
02:21:09.359 --> 02:21:11.110 align:start position:0%
but um you know i i do think that it's
essential

02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
essential
 
02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:12.550 align:start position:0%
essential
that

02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
whatever services we provide for
 
02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:16.870 align:start position:0%
whatever services we provide for
children

02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
are comprehensive
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
we need to be sure
 
02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:23.910 align:start position:0%
we need to be sure
that

02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they're getting
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah right yeah and
 
02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:30.630 align:start position:0%
yeah right yeah and
well

02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
oh yes go ahead please again just um
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i concur i think i mean they're two
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
distinct populations i think that
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
ideally looking um
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
at a comprehensive advocacy program
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
is probably a good idea down the road
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
but it seems like there's need for this
 
02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:52.309 align:start position:0%
but it seems like there's need for this
now

02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
um i think there's probably going to be
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
hiccups in trying to figure out who and
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
how this is going to work out
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
but um i certainly support the attempt
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
to try it and appreciate that are there
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
two populations that need to be
 
02:22:05.359 --> 02:22:07.349 align:start position:0%
two populations that need to be
addressed

02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
are we ready okay go ahead i need to
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
make a comment i'm i i'm obviously going
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
to vote in favor of this also and i
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
guess what i
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
what i just say is i i completely agree
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
it makes because of the differences on
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the on the type of
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing that it makes
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that that there's a good argument
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
for not having
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
them housed in the same
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the same uh office so to speak even
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
though maybe
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
man it from a managerial standpoint that
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
might be less somewhat less efficient
 
02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:41.190 align:start position:0%
might be less somewhat less efficient
um

02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:43.750 align:start position:0%
the the
the

02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
real concern i have with with this but
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to let you know let's give
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
it a try and see how it goes i think
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's the the the
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
the the analysis is still out in my view
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
even on the office of child advocate is
 
02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
even on the office of child advocate is
whether

02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
these things really work
 
02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:05.429 align:start position:0%
these things really work
whether

02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know because the theory is of this
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
of all of this stuff seems to be well
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
the school districts aren't really doing
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
their job with special education or the
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
dhhs isn't really doing its job with
 
02:23:17.439 --> 02:23:18.469 align:start position:0%
dhhs isn't really doing its job with
providing

02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate services to children and
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
therefore you need another agency to
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
sort of being be looking at them
 
02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:26.070 align:start position:0%
sort of being be looking at them
i'm

02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
i'm
i'm

02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
skeptical about i don't mean don't get
 
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
me wrong i don't mean to say for by any
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
stretch that there aren't mistakes made
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
in both schools and in the dhhs but that
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a systematic problem
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
i am skeptical about that and whether or
 
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
not this will actually
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
if they're
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
whether there is number one and number
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
two if there is that this will
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
that this will solve it um and what i'm
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
worried about is in four or five years
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
there'll be a move for another agency to
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
look over this agency um but anyway
 
02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:04.210 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:04.210 --> 02:24:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative heath we all agree with
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes

i'm sure the vote is seven to zero in
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
the affirmative okay the vote is 7-0 in
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
the affirmative so

here's kind of my plan for
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
if we wait uh
 
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
at the executive session if we wait
 
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
until we get through all the bills then
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be six o'clock
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
and then janet has two hours worth of
 
02:26:54.399 --> 02:26:55.510 align:start position:0%
and then janet has two hours worth of
work

02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%

02:26:58.399 --> 02:27:01.429 align:start position:0%
so what i'm planning to do is after each
division

02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.439 --> 02:27:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
um
