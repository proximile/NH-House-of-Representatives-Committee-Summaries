Homeland Security and Emergency
 
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
Management for the State of New
 
00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I was appointed and
 
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the governor and Council in
 
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
September of
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
2022 that date's important for you to
 
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
recognize as we sit down and have our
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
conversation this morning um prior to my
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
role as the Director of Homeland
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
Security emergency management I enjoyed
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
a 30-year career in the en hampsh of
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
fire service with the last nine and a
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
half years serving as the fire chief
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management director and public
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
health officer for the town of Hudson
 
00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh up until my time that I
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
came to work for the state so my my view
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
today is uh um offering you as more or
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
less as a customer based on the fact
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
that I was not part of the Command Staff
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
prior my arrival obviously um and I
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize that
 
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
75% of the agency at HSM has less than
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
three years with the agency so there has
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
been quite a turnover in that group uh
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
since we started okay uh and since
 
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 set in in March of 2020 so I I
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
think that's important it's my
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that we're here to discuss
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh unified command is really the role is
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
the piece that I was asked to talk about
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
today and that was uh through the chair
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
and and working with DHHS so um I'm
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
really more of a discussion person so
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not really here to offer you
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll start some with some
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
definition type stuff but please this is
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
your group I'm here to offer you some
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
input and and I can probably have a
 
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
unique perspective based on the fact of
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
where I was a customer going through
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
this whole process so um unified command
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
is really the opportunity for The
 
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
Incident Commander uh the overall
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
authority figure over an incident to
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
bring together a group of
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh to help make decisions
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh in this case uh through the
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic you had a team of
 
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
folks that were supporting the governor
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
of the state of New Hampshire that was
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
made up of the Department of Health and
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services the uh division of um
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security emergency management
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then National Guard were really the
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
three big legs uh that came to that
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
stool to support the governor as we made
 
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
decisions as to how that response was
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to move forward this is a uh
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
common practice that is utilized across
 
00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:16.879 align:start position:0%
the country uh on large scale incidents
 
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh and is something that we utilize day
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
in and day out um so from an incident
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
management perspective uh it was very
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
key for command and control perspective
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
to utilize that to to make sure we were
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
making you know good decisions and and
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
how we were going to deal with really
 
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
what was ended up being an unprecedented
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
event not only for New Hampshire but for
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
the country uh and move forward from
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
there so that is the definition I guess
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
I am more uh open to asking you what you
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss or if you have
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
anything specific you would like me to
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
key in on in regards to how that
 
00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
operates or how that work you know how
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
that works and how that affected the
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
overall operation and I can try to scope
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
that a little
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%

Emergency Management is charged with the
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
over overall planning and implementation
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
of Emergency Response plans for uh the
 
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and we are
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
charged with um making sure that those
 
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
plans meet not only the needs of the
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire but we're also
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
implementing practice good best practice
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
from the federal government from um FEMA
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so our plan is developed and reviewed
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
every five years uh and we the seoc
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
pulls together the state Emergency
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
Operations plan uh and that encompasses
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
several different things everything from
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
energy to Sheltering uh and we have at
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
our our fingertips the ability to bring
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
in Partners State Partners to help
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
support the local communities in the
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire every disaster
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
starts locally correct right so uh if
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
you think about our form of government
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
that means that we
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
have 234 communities that come directly
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
to uh hscm okay there's no in between
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
there's no County uh county level um
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
support it comes directly to the state
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
so the seoc as we call it or an
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
Emergency Operations Center over on
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
Smoky Bear Boulevard that's where that
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
takes place and so all of the requests
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
come in we actually have a unit that
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
gets stood up the local liais online a a
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
local community can go on weboc which is
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
the program that we utilize put in a
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
request and that comes in and it gets
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
filtered into the plan for the next
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
operational period and get that request
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
gets answered sometimes they take five
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
minutes sometimes they may take a couple
 
00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
hours sometimes in the covid-19 world
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there were some that took over
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
a day right so that's how the process
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
works it starts locally the information
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
comes in and we are support in nature
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
right because every every uh Community
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
is really providing those services to
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
citizens followup
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and thank you
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
for that I'd like to drill a little
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
deeper into one of the things you
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned which is that
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
Security seems to fall as far as their
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
their protocols and how they go about
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
things under the um a set of guidelines
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
best best practices I believe you said
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
promulgated by FEMA can you just give us
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
an idea of whether you might say some
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
most or all of the best practices
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
adopted by DHS uh originate with the
 
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.990 align:start position:0%
adopted by DHS uh originate with the
federal

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
government so FEMA is a at the federal
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
level big picture- wise FEMA rolls up
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
underneath the Department of Homeland
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
Security at the federal level and they
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
have several different agencies
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
underneath them one which is FEMA and we
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
are broken down into 10 regions and you
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
know we're in the New England region
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
obviously and uh we actually our
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
planning process we receive support from
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government right so for the
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
Stafford act which really lays out how
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
we recover uh was built on um hurricane
 
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
response right so that's the originality
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
of how uh you know recovery process was
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
put in place through the Stafford Act
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
was how to deal with hurricanes uh over
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
that time that is certainly uh expanded
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
as we've seen tornado response
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
earthquakes and all those things kick up
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
um but the framework from an incident
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
management standpoint at after 9911
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
really highlighted the fact that we
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
needed a national framework for how
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to address incidents and
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
that is the uh National Incident
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
Management System uh and that breaks
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
down how we look at incident command
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
unified command how the branches are set
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
up so we can address the needs of the
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
public and provide them with the best
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
service whether it's in the response
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
mode or the recovery mode we basically
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
take it from the beginning of the
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you madam
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you director buckon for
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
being here I'd like to go back up to
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
probably around 30,000
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
ft help me understand there's the issue
 
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
of what needs to be done versus how to
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
do it and I'm trying to drill down into
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
the separation of those two fundamental
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
principles is the Department of Homeland
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
Security setting policy or you basically
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
implementing the policy that was
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
set so can we just one clarification on
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
my end when we talk about the Department
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
of Homeland Security you're talking
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
federally and not the state level at the
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
state level so basically I'm trying to
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
get you is that there needs to be a
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
decision what has to be done which is
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
more of the policy side but there also
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
has to be support to ensure that that
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
decision is carried out so at the state
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
level is the role of the State homel
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
security and unified command to
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
basically execute the orders yeah
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
basically you're not enrolled to make
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
and decide the what orders have to be
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
done it's more to be sure that the order
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
wherever it came from is executed it's a
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
great question so the unified command
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
group and bringing those uh subject
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
matter experts so whether it's
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
um trying to give you a simple example
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
here but the subject matter experts are
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
in the room who provide input to the
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
decision maker meaning The Incident
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
Commander who sets policy and then gives
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
it back to the operational group to
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
follow up so I want to follow up on the
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
question about the instant um command um
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
making that decision are you making a
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
policy decision or making an operational
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
decision about how to carry out the
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
policy can you clarify that for me
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
please yeah it's
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
a we're making an operational decision
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
at the start
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
yep represent
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
Vil thank you very much for being here
 
00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
we've uh eag I think we can say we've
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
eagerly awaited uh having you here to
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
have this
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
conversation well I mean we're already
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
learning I mean I hadn't looked at RSA
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
21p so that's good to know that's there
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
and we can look at it um I've just just
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
got a few just to learn so are there a
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
whole set of rules then that are
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
associated with the statute and and your
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
implementation Powers Yeah so that's
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and the answer
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
to that is no uh so basically Ally the
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
reality is we are empowered to
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
implement Implement process and best
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
practice so we follow under the uh
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
National framework and Nims so that is
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
where that's pulled together and we pull
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
the planning piece together uh but if
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
you were looking to go to the rule set
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire it says
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
incident command means this and
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
operationally periods are defined as
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
this every incident brings its own
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
challenges so whether it's like uh the
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
storm that we had in at the beginning of
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
April where we had 182,000 people
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
without power that is a pretty much a
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
very uh small uh activation for us
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
because we're bringing in very few
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholders when you get to the
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 response you're really talking
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
humongous uh unprecedented event that
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
may made us look at Logistics how we're
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
going to deliver supplies how we're
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
going to look at testing how we're going
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
to look at vaccin ation efforts how
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at getting
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
information out to the public health
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
officials and the local emergency
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
management directors so the communities
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
can make decisions at their level in
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
regards to uh what they were going to do
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
with their their practices and how they
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
were going to approach us at the Town
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
level okay um and go from there so so
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
just can I just ask a couple followups
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
sure okay I mean it won't because we've
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
got a so um so on a very like surface
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
level you said that you folks have an
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
yep what was the when was the last time
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
that plan had been updated when covid
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
hit number one and number two did the
 
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
hit number one and number two did the
plan

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
include pandemic type
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
responses because I think what you said
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
is most of what these plans are concept
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
calized on is a a a
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
natural act then it had to be expanded
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
to like 911 but anyway I we're trying as
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
we get to the preparedness
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
issue yep so um it's a two-part answer
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh a two two questions yeah so so the
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
fir first part
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
is the uh last update to the plan was
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
done in 2019 so if you add the five year
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
window we're actually starting right now
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
the review for the state Emergency
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
Operations plan to update that so it's
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
new and fresh at the end of 24 going
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
into 25 okay so that's the first answer
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
so it had been updated just prior to uh
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
the uh covid-19 pandemic um if you go
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
and you look at 21p it will talk about
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
the uh coordinating of efforts with
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
public health so we are we partner with
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
public health and
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS almost on a daily basis if we have
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
an incident there in the EOC very
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
frequently because we're talking about
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
Sheltering practices how to set up
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
Regional shelters how do we get out if
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
we need to get food out or if a
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
community needs to get water in how how
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
are we managing that and managing the
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
Red Cross and some of our
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofits so when you look at the um
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
the second part of the question
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
regarding public health and is that plan
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
be um Nimble enough to bring the
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
response in that's exactly what it's set
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
up to do so the national Incident
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
Management System is set up to work with
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
the different stakeholders to adjust its
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
framework to be able to support them now
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
on the public health side of of and I'm
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
speaking for my public health days here
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
for a second as the public health
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
official in Hudson we we had worked on
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh point of distribution plans and um
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know bird flu type type stuff prior
 
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
to this so there were practices and
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
drills that had been done prior to the
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
covid-19 response at a at a smaller
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
scale right when you start talking about
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 response and you start
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
looking at that scale uh it was
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
something we hadn't seen but that
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the framework wasn't there
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
to be nimble to to adjust and bring that
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
forward to be able to support the
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
communities going and then I'll stop so
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um well because I had heard at some
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
point um at the federal level the
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic response team had been you know
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
basically defunded and there wasn't a
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
lot of support for the Calamity that we
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
were facing at that time but when you
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
were developing well I guess when they
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
were developing the plan say in 2019
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
then they would have been looking at
 
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.310 align:start position:0%
then they would have been looking at
Best

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
Best
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
Practices for the time yep yep that's
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you represent
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for coming thank you for
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to follow
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
up on R Martian's question is who what
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
bring it closer yes um who did make if
 
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
you said you made the operational policy
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
well who did make the underlying policy
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
which you were then
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
implementing can you clarify exactly
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
what you mean by policy so if you're
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
talking about executive orders and those
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
types of things well that would be the
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
governor yeah so a lot of like regarding
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh how policy came out or practices um
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
those came down from recommendations
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
from FEMA to the state level uh DHHS
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
would put it through the state their
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group bring it back to the
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
command you know the unified command to
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
say hey we should go this path and then
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
that was the implementation of that
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
policy was the way that would roll okay
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
yep represent Merchant thank you Madam
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again director
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
buckon for thinking the question um one
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that I
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
think I learned from D diving into some
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
detail is how well the state of New
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did nationally and which and
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
my measurement to say that is based upon
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
the fact of how many people died per
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
100,000 the only state that did better
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
than we did according to the data I read
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
was the state of Hawaii because they
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
could shut the island down so in saying
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
that I would say the state overall did a
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
fairly good job in managing the
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
resources it had to accomplish saving
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
lives in saying that as well given the
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
fact that there were things that
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
probably along the way that the unified
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
command or your
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
agency learned what worked well and what
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
did we learn from it that we could take
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
going forward with another pandemic
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't think this will be the
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
last one we're going to see yeah that
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great uh question uh
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't agree with you more that
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
the work that the state of New Hampshire
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
did early into the response and the way
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
they set up the framework and how
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
aggressive they were in regards to
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
putting the unified command into place
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
uh really paid dividend as we moved into
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
what was started as a you know my wife's
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
a school teacher right so my my
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
threshold is yeah we're going to be out
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
of school for two weeks you know and I
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
have two kids that are in school right
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be out of school for
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
two weeks and we're going to back and
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
will be fine right and then that o
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
obviously blossomed um the state was
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
very aggressive about putting a
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
framework in place to be able to not
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
only support the local communities but
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
assist them in getting what they needed
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we could get the
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
schools open to make sure we could
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
provide those resources in an
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
environment that really
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
um changed every day right uh it it
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
truly changed every single day uh you
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
eoc's that were opening up in local
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh and you had folks in
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
the in roles that they had never truly
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
prepared for a and you had folks working
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
at the state level doing jobs that were
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
whether it was a call center or whether
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
it was uh a testing site and supporting
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
a testing site we
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
really the way the state approach this
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
and the Hands-On approach helped to save
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
and move things forward and be
 
00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.350 align:start position:0%
and move things forward and be
successful

00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
so I want to say thank you again yeah no
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
I appreciate
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair um it's
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
going to take me a fair bit of research
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
to to figure out some of the things that
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for details on so I'm hoping
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
you can help me uh narrow this down a
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
little bit because you've said
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
that um generally speaking the
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security of New
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire falls more or less under the
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
direction of the federal ederal
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security so I'm
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
looking do you do you have to know or
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
can you get to the committee what um
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Andor State statutes um
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
authorize the state uh organization to
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
be under a sort of direct incident or
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
direct command system from the federal
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
agencies yeah our our enabling
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
legislation could be found in 21p 21 P
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yep and it lays out the
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for planning and response
 
00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:03.190 align:start position:0%
requirements for planning and response
coordination

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
uh one sec yeah and if you look under 21
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
Peak especially colon 34 that really
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
talks about Homeland Security and
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management that helps a lot
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
okay and represent Belgium thank you
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair and and another question
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
totally unrelated to that one um you
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you're the DHS is
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
partnering regularly with the Department
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and others
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
curious uh because as as we've heard
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
before we may not have seen the end of
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
disease are there any current plans or
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
activations or anything of that nature
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
underway right now for the current
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
outbreak of Aven
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
flu it's a great question and I at this
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
point looking over my memory bank we
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't have an exercise in place right
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
now thank you
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
yep represent po off
 
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.510 align:start position:0%
yep represent po off
[Music]

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madame chair thank you for
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question so
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
following up on previous question for
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
future uh medical emergencies what
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
exactly triggers uh your department
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
involvement uh is it national emergency
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
declaration or is it some State local
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
declaration uh when you get
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
involved so you want to know when we
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
activate when we engage
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try to narrow this down
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
because that's a pretty broad question
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
right so we talked about every every uh
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
disaster starts locally right so and and
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
we have different thresholds for how we
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
respond depending on the time of year
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
right so if I get up and I have 14,000
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
people without
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
power uh in June our response is not
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
going to be as uh we're going to be more
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
of a uh coordinating event instead of
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
having the EOC open um based on the fact
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
that it's warm out right we want to get
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
power back to folks it's warm there's
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
heat the there's ability to have windows
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
open we really run into a
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
challenge in the middle of the winter
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
when we get and have 14,000 people
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
without power that's our threshold for
 
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
opening and we have a couple different
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
levels at which we open at so we have
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
what is called enhanced monitoring where
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
hscm will actually be in the the state
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
EOC monitoring it monitoring what's
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
happening in the field that's a big
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's a big definition there right so
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
we come in and we enhanc monitor what's
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
taking place um if we need to go to a
 
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
taking place um if we need to go to a
partial

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
partial
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
activation that means that we're
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
bringing in more than
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
two um
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders into the OC so that means
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing bringing in say I'm going
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
to use the power example again because
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's the most common here in New
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you would bring in the energy
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
sector we would bring in DHHS who gives
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
us a hand with um Sheltering uh we would
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
bring in our Communications Group and
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
911 group and we bring in State Police
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
because that's how we deal with our
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
communication level we would also
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
activate our local liaz online which is
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
going to provide direct access for any
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
Community put a need in and and contact
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
us directly okay um and then from there
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
if we need to get more than you know uh
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
a couple esfs together then we really
 
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:40.039 align:start position:0%
look at like hey it's time to Pivot and
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
go to a full activation okay and that
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
conversation really starts um not only
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
with our office but having further
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with the governor like hey
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
here here's what we're seeing this is
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
what we're forecasting and this is how
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
we believe we need to bring this under
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
control because we don't live we don't
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
live in a a vacuum right we live in a a
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
very open uh communicative uh response
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
mode and get that
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
out representative Merchant thank you
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you Mr backton
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
question I want to drill back into what
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
representative belter talked about and
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's back to the governance if you
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
will of the agency and I'm not really
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
sure I understand it completely there is
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
the federal level as also the state
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
level so what role is a federal
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
government doing as far as the
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
governance of your agency versus the
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
state level is it really coming more
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
into funding or do they actually as some
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
would say calling the shots and telling
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
the agency what to do is it really
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
coming back to the state and our own
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
state policymakers in our own state
 
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
government making those key decisions y
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
so to clarify that so the federal
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
government will give us guidance we
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
implement the guidance here we make the
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
decisions here locally uh really that
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
that is the decision that's made here in
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire regarding
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
what we need what our needs are what our
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
needs are not and they help us with uh
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
from not only from the response side but
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
from the recovery side um so the
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
recovery side of the house really deals
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
with like hey what happens post post
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
incident how do we fix the roads how do
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
we do things and what's a recovery money
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
coming back into the state followup
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
thank you m chair so in saying that akin
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
to it would be not 100% comparable but
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
something like it it's kind of like the
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
National Guard where basically National
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
Guard is under the state control uh for
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
the most part unless it's federalized
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
but for the most part sort of sounds
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
like the same thing with the state
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
agency the federal government's there to
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
Resource it and provide policies and so
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
forth about how to use the resource but
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're not ultimately as I said before
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
telling the agency how to do something
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
representative eel thank you so I don't
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
know if you can um speak to this exactly
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
but that's the way it works I guess for
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security but when you're
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
talking when you're talking about uh
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
vaccin vaccine approvals and things of
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
that nature there's not really a role
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
for the state that sort of directive
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
comes from the federal government yeah
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
that's a much
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
larger if yeah much larger piece and
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
that would be authorized at the federal
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
level y right and so then it would just
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
be up to the state to how to implement
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
how to use those vaccines as part of its
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
response plan or how to implement and
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
how to distribute implementation and
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
distrib so not assessment of their
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
validity but implementation and
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
distribution okay then I have just
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
another question so you know part of our
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
job here is to assess the efficacy of
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
response and we had been told that
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
actually your um your department was
 
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
doing exactly the same thing so is that
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
part of your development of a new
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management plan or are you
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
doing a separate kind of report
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
assessing the covid response yep the
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is under contract
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
with a company called Title Basin uh and
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
for the last 12 months they have been
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
doing working through the after action
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
review process for
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and not only looking at um not
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
only looking at the response but
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
basically saying hey here here were the
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
shortcomings or here are the the
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
Improvement areas to help us grow right
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
that report is actually due out the end
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
of this month uh and um so that is not
 
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.029 align:start position:0%
of this month uh and um so that is not
available

00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
yet um when that is available uh do you
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
do you think you could send a copy to
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
our committee once it's accepted and
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
made public yeah that' probably be
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
available when would when do you think
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
that might be it's coming in the end of
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
June um we'll go through a review
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
process get it to the governor's office
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it's really their report you know um
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
and and I don't really have a timeline
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
on that yet sorry um I know you don't
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
have a timeline um but your review
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
process what are you thinking it's going
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
to take month two months yeah I would I
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
would assume that our seop update will
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh wait not wait but we get started and
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
then we'll review that after action re
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
review and see what pieces we need to
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
put into place into the updated plan so
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
we'll wait before we finish our work on
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
updating the Emergency Operations plan
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my more specific question
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
was regarding the report itself um it's
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
due out the end of June um and and it
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
has to go through a review process
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
obviously your department is going to
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
have a re piece in that reviewing it
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
what is your time your Department's
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
timeline do you have a a deadline of
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
when you going to have that review
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
completed so once I have the report in
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
hand it'll become a top priority to to
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
read and get our folks engaged on what
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
that looks like and get stakeholders at
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
the table that need to review that
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
report thank you representative
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and I think
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
now that we have a little bit of a a
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
better concept of the the command
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
structure and how and how that portion
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
went I'd like to get a little bit into
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
um sort of enforcement mechanisms and
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
what sort of enforcement uh actions um
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
fall under the Department of Homeland
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
Security regarding anything to do with
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
response um so you're really talking
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
about what enforcement capabilities come
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
under underneath the governor's office
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
through the state of
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
emergency uh and that is really where
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
that is driven from uh and that is
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh underneath the governor's powers and
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
underneath the state of emergency Powers
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh that he has the ability to
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
enforce um enforce certain things and
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
inverse La enforce law and that
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
obviously is enabling legislation for
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
him to empower those those
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
things uh
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so there is a section called govern
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
Governor Duty and it's uh
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
21 p uh col 43- a um just for for
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
reference uh represent Bel you have a
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
followup yes thank you madam chair and
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for help to clarify the the
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
source of the uh Authority I'd like to
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
go a little bit deeper if you if you can
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
if you're prepared to have um any
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
information on what um sort of specific
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions May have fallen
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Homeland
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
Security that may have been taken um as
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
a part of any of the orders or anything
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
else that was occurring under uh covid
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
response yeah so what I can tell you is
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
under um chapter four the powers of the
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
governor's are Governor uh for semicolon
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
45 it outlines the state of emergency
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
practices and what and what the governor
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
is able to empower and go from there
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
regarding what hscm directly during the
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
co response was responsible from an
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement standpoint I can't answer
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
that question as I sit here today
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
without going back and reviewing um so I
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
apologize followup yes and just if if uh
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
at any point you were um any of your
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
people could get some information to
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
this committee on specific actions that
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
were taken by DHS that would be very
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
helpful to us thank you represent
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um given that
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
there's a contract with tile basin
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming having worked on some of
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
these contracts myself there's going to
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
be a saving of Works something which the
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
contractor is supposed to be assessing
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
and what their obligations are under the
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
contract is that statement to work
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere publicly because it must have
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
gone through the governor in Council in
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
order for that contract to be reviewed
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
and where will we find it yeah I I don't
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
have the contract with me but I believe
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
that that would be something that you
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
could get from administrative Services
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
that's a contract that was signed by the
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
agency uh and available publicly and
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
that would go through the department of
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
administrative services with
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house yep and then
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
follow by May what I'm trying to get to
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
is trying to understand under that
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
report when it comes out again back to
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
that fundamental question I asked before
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
are they trying to assess the
 
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
operational response or trying to assess
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
the policy that were put into place that
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
were operationalized on both of them
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to do you
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
know at this point in time what the
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the report was it was looking
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
strictly at how we responded and used
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
the resources or basically at that point
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
in time how we set some policies yeah I
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
think it looked at how we responded it
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
did not um look at individual policy I
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe uh but I don't have the
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
scope in front of me to 100% answer that
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
representative eel um I think getting
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
that contract with the scope of services
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
and everything would be really really
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
helpful um I think it's fair D to say
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
that as a committee it's really
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
difficult for us without staff to assess
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
the response so I'm curious just
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
generally do do you know what the cost
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
of the the contract was and obviously
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
you folks didn't have the and it's also
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
good to have an objective Observer I
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
know but I'm sure you folks didn't have
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
the staff to do it it sounds like a huge
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
undertaking yeah it it is is a huge
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
undertaking um I used to know that
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
number but I apologize that that is you
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
have a ballpark yeah I don't I I I would
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
it was over $100,000 for sure yeah yeah
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's a Year's worth of it's a
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
Year's worth of work Year's worth of
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
work and I just so we had gotten this
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
from um uh Trisha Tilly when she
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
described what you were covering I had
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
and what she said was preparedness comp
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
command communication decision Mak
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
financial management health and medical
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
Logistics public private Partnerships
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
and public information do that sound
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
that's what you expected me to speak to
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
this morning no I just I just I mean
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's an incredibly comprehensive report
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
and and I think based on our mission
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're just you know we're it's a it's a
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
narrower analysis yeah um but I think
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
from from our perspective whatever that
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
report reveals will be hugely uh yeah
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
will be hugely helpful and I think part
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
chair's questioning was because we
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
basically are looking at an early
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
November time frame if we were going to
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
make any recommendation so we're hoping
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
that we get something really uh good and
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
useful uh before we are supposed to take
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
some action okay thanks I did take a
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
note regarding the scope of the process
 
00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:28.349 align:start position:0%
note regarding the scope of the process
so

00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully to help you with that
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you uh in
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
regards to this kind of analysis being
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
done at the state level with the Title
 
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.829 align:start position:0%
done at the state level with the Title
Basin

00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
Basin
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
contractor can you comment about is this
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
something unique to New Hampshire or
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
other states doing the same kind of
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
Journey what I'm trying to get to if
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
there other states doing it it'd be
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
interesting to see how our evaluation
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
done through title basement May compare
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
to some of the other states least some
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the key IND ators within those
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
reports yeah I I think that um the after
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
action review process uh in the
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management Field is something
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
that we seek out a lot right you know um
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
so yes other states are doing reviews uh
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
other states have completed their
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
reviews already uh and um this is the
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
process this is one of the services that
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
Title Basin provides and they've done
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
other states on top of that followup
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Madam chair so in
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
saying that I mean I would find it very
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
interesting to look at how Title
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
Basin looks at and analyzing our
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
response but more importantly how that
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
is compared to some of the other states
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
that they have possibly done and what
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
were the strengths that we had what were
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
the weaknesses we had and try to
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
understand from that point of view is
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
this is what we did how does it stand up
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
against what other states have done
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
because I think at the end of the day is
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to measure our response but
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
not do it in the vacuum but trying to do
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
it in a more
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um analysis not just
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
internally but also externally across
 
00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.630 align:start position:0%
internally but also externally across
the

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
country yes I agree with that repres P
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
off thank you Madame chair um my
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
question is uh about implementation I
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
understand that on federal level um uh
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
to implement the decisions uh they were
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
managing uh uh different
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh um there was uh there always uh some
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
fractions who fighting against it so
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
they were managing how information is
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
being spread and identifying some
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
misinformation and on the federal level
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
cisa um the cyber security and
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Security Agency and the
 
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Security Agency and the
Federal

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Homeland Security who
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
is helping with that so I wonder how uh
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's happening on state level under your
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
department uh do you have any
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
involvement when you implement certain
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
decision uh um uh do do you identify
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
some information and some uh how to
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
fight misinformation how it's happening
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh here yeah yeah so we work very
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
closely with sisa today in regards to
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
how to make sure that we're getting out
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
the the right pieces of information um
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
and uh you know the federal government
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
has provided a lot of resources to us to
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are um our cyber
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
security pieces are secure make sure
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
that we have gu you know guidance to
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
help communities develop uh the the if
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
you think about where we were uh March
 
00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.870 align:start position:0%
you think about where we were uh March
of

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
2020 uh regarding technology and where
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
we are today the utilization of
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
technology has just blossomed over time
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know I I can tell you that I have
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
two kids at home that are very they
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
would tell you what did covid-19 do for
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
them they got cell phones because they
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to talk with their
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
friends right that was very important to
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
us but that utilization of of Technology
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't come without its own risks right
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
you know and how how information is
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
pushed out and how we're verifying
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
information and and we uh really uh try
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
to drill down and make sure that we're
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
pushing out uh appropriate information
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
that can be validated uh and go from
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
there so everything that we came in
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
comes in has a source and and make sure
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
that we're making a decision on quality
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
pieces of
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
leus so who made the decisions as to
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
what information was being put out was
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
that you or was that coming from
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and then you were just making
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
sure that it was going out or how did
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
that work so there was a uh Joint
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
Information Center or the J as it's
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
called is attached to the
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
um attached to the unified command and
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
their job is to deal with the messaging
 
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
piece and I think if you recall and I'm
 
00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.910 align:start position:0%
piece and I think if you recall and I'm
I'm

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
just from a 30,000 foot level because I
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't involved in the day today
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
conversations but if you look at it uh
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
successes that I see as a as a as S as a
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
local official at the time but as a
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer here in the state was the
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
amount of um press conferences that were
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
held to push information out really was
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
an idea or a theory to get quality
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
information out as fast as we could and
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
though that was pushed together and how
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
they reviewed that internally was
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
basically pushed through that joint
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
information Center and then verified by
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
the subject matter experts that were
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
advising the governor you know whether
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
it was the Health and Human Services uh
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation that came in or whether
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
it was an emergency management that uh
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation that came in all of those
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
came things come in and and a decision
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
is made because at some point there
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh DEC confliction done to
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
make sure we stay in line with where we
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
want to be as a state uh and then from
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
there we push information out and I'm
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
not telling you folks anything you don't
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
know we're a very locally controlled
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
state right so we want to get
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
information down so the local uh
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
government leaders can make the best
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
decision for their communities so it's a
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
trickle down
 
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.750 align:start position:0%
trickle down
process

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um I just want to
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
drill down into that some because as
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
we've had various speakers in um there
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
was information that was available that
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
was not being put out that could have
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
been very
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
useful and so the question is
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
who was kind of the gatekeeper on that
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
who decided whether the information was
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
good information or bad information who
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
decided which information to push and
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
which to kind of Silence so from a
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operational piece through the
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
covid-19 response I really can't comment
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
on that because I was not in this role
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
at that time I was not engaged in that
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
conversation would that be something you
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
could find out and send to us I can ask
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
the question thank you uh I would assume
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
that from a communication standpoint
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
that that will be something that is
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
reviewed in the after action review
 
00:47:34.599 --> 00:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
reviewed in the after action review
thank

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
you represent p is
 
00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:41.309 align:start position:0%
you represent p is
off

00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
so on our during our previous committee
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
meetings uh uh we heard uh that
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh um under governor in in New Hampshire
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
there is a tenden to stick with
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
decisions that were initially made uh so
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you would agree with this
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
and my concern is for example with Co
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
response science was changing very
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
rapidly initially we were hoping that
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines will stop transmission then at
 
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
some point science discovered that they
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
do not stop transmission but because
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
there was tendency on federal level on
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
local level to stick with with decisions
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
that were made like there was like it
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
was a long process and backing up to my
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
previous question like if uh if if if
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
something was identified as misinform
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
misinformation but the science already
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
changed and maybe uh it's actually not
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation but we are still sticking
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
to the old decision I see a problem in
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
what your thought on it and uh any would
 
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
you agree that New Hampshire tends to
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
stick with old
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
decisions so I don't know that that's a
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
question that I
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
can give you a quality answer on um but
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
I would share that if you look at what
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
was taking place during the covid-19
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
response um I think um You probably
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
heard this a couple of different times
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
but it was
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
literally like flying a plane and
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
building it at the same time if you look
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
at the way you did things in your home
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of covid-19 and the way
 
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
you approached them at the end were far
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
different you know um if you look at the
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
way things were done at local
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities um at at the beginning of
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
covid-19 versus the end of covid-19 what
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
were the communities that pivoted uh to
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
take new information into
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
consideration um and do things like
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
opening Town Halls back up and how they
 
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:03.799 align:start position:0%
were processing information um that I
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
think you would see across the state was
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
at different levels you know uh and and
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
that is where that local control really
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
drives that that bus and that is a
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
decision that is made made
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
locally represent
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and I want
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
to follow up a little bit on sort of
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
that same line of um of qu quiry because
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
part of the part of the charge of this
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
group is going to be to try to see if
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
there might be any recommendations to be
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
made for future events that could occur
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
so without looking just without
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking specifically to what
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
happened in covid but more just asking
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
your overall impression um do you feel
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
like the
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
current organizational
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
structure is such that it's sufficiently
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
Nimble to be be able to adapt to
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
changing circumstances that occur in in
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
an emergency type such as a pandemic and
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
do you and the second part of that is do
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
you believe that or do you see any way
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
that there might be recommendations made
 
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.309 align:start position:0%
that there might be recommendations made
to

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
um to make alterations that would allow
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
for um for new science and new
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
information to be adopted in a in a
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
rather rapid manner manner um because as
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
as I think we all know there can
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes be a tendency within
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat bureaucracy to to have a
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
difficult time adapting so do you do you
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
have any recommendations or do you see
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
any any ways to maybe uh make things
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
better yeah so I
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
think I think you're talking about
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
communication right and how we how we
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know it comes down to how do we
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
communicate right I I would share with
 
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
you that one of the most enjoyable parts
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
to my job is the fact that I have direct
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
access into the governor's office and
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
with every commissioner across the state
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh so if I need to have
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
communication or I need to get a piece
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
of information out or verify a piece of
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
information it is literally One Call
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
Away when you're under a response model
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
where you're in a unified command that
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
that is something that helps you because
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
the network is already created before
 
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
the incident really takes place uh if
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
you look at the State of New Hampshire
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
that is not just something that happened
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic uh emergency manage
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and Emergency
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
Management in the state is very active
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
part o of what happens we we really
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
coordinate a lot of things whether it's
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh talking about the Nascar race that'll
 
00:52:47.069 --> 00:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
be two weeks from now or uh a snowstorm
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
or a flooding event like we have direct
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
access to everybody to be able to have
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
that conversation so I do believe that
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to be nimble uh the
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
the question regarding like Hey how do
 
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
we move this forward I think one of the
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
things that I come into this chair uh
 
00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:06.799 align:start position:0%
still fairly fresh is like hey we
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
recognize that there has been turnover
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
across the state that means that we need
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
to put training and exercise and
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
development work together to make sure
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we're pulling that together uh and
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
and what does that look like and how do
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
we work with those Partners like public
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
health because you have the regional
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
Public Health Network that is in the
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
field day in and day out partnering and
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to bring the local
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
communities together so you have public
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
health the municipalities and the
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
schools and try to get them under one
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
tent and be able hey how are we going to
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
how are we going to address this issue
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
what does that look like from a workshop
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
to a tabletop we we're in a room to a
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
fullscale exercise really is the goal
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
moving forward we house a a training
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
exercise and Development Group within
 
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
our within our agency uh in their task
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
with uh everything um from a Hazmat
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
incident all the way through an active
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
ass salent drill so those touch points
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
are taking place and we partner with
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver and her staff and
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
Steph lock and that group uh to really
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
bring that together because we're not
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to stand by ourselves we can't
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
work in a vacuum right so we're very
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
very open in communicating pushing the
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
requests across and supporting because
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
we as I go back to where I was I don't
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
know how long almost an hour ago now um
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
we're supportive in nature to help the
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
communities move the initiatives
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
forward represent vble so this is a
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
really broad question when when you um
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
initially spoke you said that you were
 
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
in the role you were not in the role um
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic that you are in now
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
and you could speak to it more as a
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
customer rather than and I would say if
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's a weakness in in the folks that
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
we haven't had come and testified us
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's we haven't really heard from munici
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
M municipalities so much so um what is
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
there something you would like to share
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
what you thought was done well what you
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
didn't um I'll just throw that open yeah
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
no I I think I appreciate that question
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
um because it it is a challenge right to
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
hear from 234 different
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
communities in regards to what that
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
looks like um I would share that I
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
thought the state did a tremendous job
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
in pushing information out so we could
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
make decisions at the local level and
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
how do you pivot to be able to provide
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
services to the
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
constituents and and make it successful
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
and make it safe um so I think
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
communication wise and logistically we
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
did a very good job I could literally go
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
in put an order in you know very short
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
order after March if we were running
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
short on a piece of equipment I could
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
put in you know hey what's the status on
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
masks like in the next day be like hey
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
meet the National Guards person over at
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
the exit 6 um DMV facility and they're
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
going to be there doing your
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
distribution your order will be there or
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
if you need something earlier drive up
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
to the warehouse and we'll get it and
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
they had put processes in place and if
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
you think about
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
that those are all things that show how
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
Nimble we can be as a state because
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
those processes and taking a National
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
Guards person and basically saying hey
 
00:56:40.589 --> 00:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
can you stand this process up I'm sure
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
there were some that were like they
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
didn't review this in training right
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
like how we and this is in my real in my
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
real world job I'm a project manager so
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
I use those skills to help make us
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
successful and that's really the key to
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
the success in this state and to have
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
that Hands-On approach from the uh the
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
governor's office on down to be engaged
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
in what was happening uh and and have
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
him talking with the fire chiefs with
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Management directors with
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
law enforcement the public health
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
officers that that was important so I
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
think we did a pretty good job from that
 
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.589 align:start position:0%
think we did a pretty good job from that
and

00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
and it was such a
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
large response that you know we were all
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
kind of growing at the same time so
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
followup so I didn't hear anything
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
negative there was there anything you
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
wish we'd done
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
better um recognizing your current
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
position yeah no I I get that yeah no I
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
get that um what could be you know I
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
um obviously the challenges regarding
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
executive order and policy and those
 
00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
types of things um certainly become an
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
implementation piece uh that's debated
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
so it's debated here and then it's
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
debated locally
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
and and the communication was very good
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
getting information down but what was
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
the breakdown below so it was more below
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
um I would say but then once we got over
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
that it was good so I don't really have
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
anything okay represent
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair and also
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
director buckon I want to follow on that
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
question or the response to the question
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
communication in your
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
opinion was the fundamental issue about
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
the how things were being handled from
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
an operational point of view of getting
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
resources to the communities or more
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
about the policy that was being
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
communicated down local municipalities
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
because there's a difference between
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
agreeing with the resources we need in
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
order to get the vaccine whatever else
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
we need versus the policy behind that
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
because if the policy was really what
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
was being Deb deed at the local level
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that's a different
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
issue than how we respond to it and I
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
want to be clear we're talking about how
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
we respond to it not debating the policy
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no it was the response it was
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
the operational piece it was the
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
implementation it wasn't like we weren't
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
um opening up new debate on policy that
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
level represent po off thank you Madame
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Buon different question
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of your testimony you
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
75% of people in your department are new
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
people uh and they joined uh uh in less
 
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
than three years and um I wonder how
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
it's compared to other department and
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
was it always like this is it something
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
new does it do you know reasons does it
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with like I don't
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
know Co response B out something no no
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's a great it's a great question um
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
I I would say that it's probably
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
multifaceted right you had folks that at
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
the end of the covid-19 response
 
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
were ready to go
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
home they they were ready to be home for
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
a while right and and you saw some
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
retirements and folks that were in uh
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
key positions within the state that have
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
moved on uh and and that is just comes
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
from the work the the human body can
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
only work at a rate for so long before
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
it needs to take a break right um we
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
also have had a host of Staff internally
 
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.430 align:start position:0%
also have had a host of Staff internally
to

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
HSM um because of the covid-19 response
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
that has actually moved on to go to work
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
for the federal government they're
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
actually working for FEMA now uh because
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a branch of FEMA uh
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
from a public assistance standpoint that
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
was non-existent prior to
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um and uh those
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities have provided career
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
growth uh for folks that really got into
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
this business to see their careers grow
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
and some of that was a natural path and
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
and then you probably had some folks who
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
were like yeah I don't want to do that
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
anymore and and just found a different
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
path and moved on so um but overall I
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
would say the change over in the staff
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh has been something of a natural
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
progression you know and folks take
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
different opportunities want to do a
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
different style of work because um
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
leus I still want to go down that uh
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
policy path if you don't
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
mind and so your department your job
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
really is implementation of the policy
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
and you didn't open up anything to
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
question that policy you went with
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
whatever so I want to just so we know
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
that in the in the future of this
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
committee that we're talking to the
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
right people as far as policy so the
 
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.710 align:start position:0%
right people as far as policy so the
governor

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.710 align:start position:0%
governor
obviously

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS who else would have been I mean
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
policy came from federal right but then
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
as far as for our
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
state in deciding whether to follow the
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
Fed policy not um what parts we were
 
01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:31.230 align:start position:0%
Fed policy not um what parts we were
going

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
to who was developing it that you then
 
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
had to implement I guess so that we can
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
make sure we talk to those people yeah
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
so I would go right back to where we
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
started when we identified the unified
 
01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:46.039 align:start position:0%
command folks right so you had uh the
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
you had hscm and you had the National
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
Guard uh um you know in the in the
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
unified command role Prov providing
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
support to the governor uh I can't
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
answer on a day-to-day basis who else
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
they sought uh subject matter expertise
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
from um but I can tell you from a
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental foundational level those
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
were the three ke key agencies that
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
helped develop things to move forward
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
much representative eel thank you so
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
much for all these questions a lot of
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
times we're just sitting here listening
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
but not
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
today um so I I actually I don't know a
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
lot about Homeland Security uh when it
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
was actually created in the state of New
 
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.750 align:start position:0%
was actually created in the state of New
Hampshire

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
um and 200 when 2002 2002 um it
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
obviously must have
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
evolved uh I wondered who the homeland
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
security uh head was during the time of
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
the um pandemic and I wondered if you
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
could just speak generally about the
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
history and maybe how it's evolved since
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
Co that sort of thing yeah so um I I'll
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
take you back a little further than that
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
even good so pre
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
911 um Homeland Security did not exist
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the federal government right um 911
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
really catapulted the opportunity to
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
create the division of Homeland Security
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the federal level um but the state of
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had a dual uh hated
 
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
agency um and it actually started out as
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
a civil defense back you know the old
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
days Right started as civil defense and
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
then uh for those that have been in
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
their chairs for a while a gentleman by
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
the name of Don Bliss who was a State
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal uh actually was the fire
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
marshal and the Emergency Management
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
director for the state after 911
 
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
happened um Chris Pope who was the uh
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
EMD for the city of conquered actually
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
came in and was part of the uh
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
formalization of the homeland security
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
and Emergency Management Group okay uh
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
what's changed since then I would tell
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
you the landscape of Homeland Security
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
and Emergency Management in the country
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
is a landscape that is evolving today uh
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at uh the number of uh
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
storms that we're having you look at the
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh number of other um security functions
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with um you know
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding and supporting uh multiple
 
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
different venues in regards to how we
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
deal with cyber security now that is an
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
Annex that is coming into the is part of
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
the state Emergency Operations plan you
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
know 20 years ago that would have never
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
been a piece of that right um we didn't
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
even understand what the impacts of that
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
were so we are we are an agency that
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
really puts a lot of people in the room
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
to put plans together for bad days and
 
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's really the goal to make sure we
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
are on that Cutting Edge to make sure
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're bringing those folks together and
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
we we're the coordinating
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
arm follow
 
01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:11.230 align:start position:0%
arm follow
up

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
um so in developing the next Emergency
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
Management plan for the State of New
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it sounds like that's going to
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
look quite a bit different and be far
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
broader because it'll I because climate
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
change there's huge storm response
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
issues which isn't our purview thank the
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
Lord uh um but then you're going to have
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
an aspect of that that will be pandemic
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
or Health crisis yeah a broader one
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
presumably than what you have and we'll
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
work that with our stakeholder groups
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
right so the Department of Health and
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services will be key stakeholders
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
and bringing that together and helping
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
us develop that that none of this gets
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
done in vacuum you really make sure that
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
you're getting the right people in the
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
room to help develop their because they
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
have to take ownership of those things
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
we can only be the subject matter expert
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
of so many so many points they need to
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
take ownership of those responses and
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
help develop those plans and I assume
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
there might be legislative
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations perhaps as part of that
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
or or I I would assume over time you
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
oh represent
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
cran thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
question I'm still trying to formulate
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
it so forgive me um just going back to
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
the the sort of personnel turnover piece
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about earlier um do
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
you feel are there takeaways from covid
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of where we need to be with
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
with Staffing or um things that we
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
should sort of activate with you know
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
maybe emergency hiring things like that
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
and in the event
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
of sort of a a long emergency like yeah
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
no I I appreciate that question um I
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
tell stakeholder groups this a lot
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management is the best team
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
sport in
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
existence and it and is truly a team
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
sport right um our job at at Homeland
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
Security emergency management is to
 
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
provide the framework to bring the
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts in and and
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
coordinating their messaging and making
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
sure we're getting information out uh
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
certainly uh currently today we have 15
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
open Federal
 
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
disasters so on the recovery side of the
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
house you look at what does that mean
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
and covid-19 is one of those disasters
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
okay so what does that mean that means
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
that we're working with FEMA uh last
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
month I believe they pushed out almost
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
$8 million in disaster relief from the
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
federal government here
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
locally um so those are the areas that's
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
really the long-term recovery piece that
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
becomes a mechanism of of challenge the
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
good news is is that we also receive
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
management costs from the federal
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
government to manage those things here
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
locally uh so we have that nimbleness to
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
help bolster that when we need to um we
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
run a pretty lean agency and and that's
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
helps us to provide a more a customer
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
service that is very you know it's not
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
uncommon for somebody to pick up and
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
call me you know I'm not insulated from
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
that nor do I want to be insulated from
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
that I want to be available and making
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
sure that they're getting what they need
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
and that's an important part of the job
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
so I I think for purposes of our
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
discussion I think um that I'm going to
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
read um 21p col 34 what the purpose of
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and Emergency
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
Management is and maybe
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
if the definition may need to be changed
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
or tweaked in the future but I think it
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
would really help us understand um and
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
what it says is um because of the
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
possibility of the occurrence of natural
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
and human-caused
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
disasters resulting from fire flood
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will be adequately
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%

01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
generally in order to preserve the lives
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%

of the state
 
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
that all Emergency Management functions

maximum extent with the comparable
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
functions of the federal government
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
including its various departments and
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%

and of private agencies of every type to
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
the end that the most effective
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
preparation and use may be made of the
 
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
nation's Manpower resources and
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
facilities for dealing with any disaster
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
or incident of terrorism that may occur
 
01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
it's pretty broad um and it encompasses
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
a lot but I think um it's really
 
01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
important to understand what the purpose
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
of the department is um and also stated
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of this was that every
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
Community I believe in New Hampshire
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I I missp speake um
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
has an emergency management unit in
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
place I know know in my town of
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
Barnstead we do have people that head
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
that up and I think in other towns there
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
are Point people in place um it is a
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
requirement for every Community to have
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
an emergency management director if the
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
governing agency Board of selectman Town
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
Council fail to appoint somebody they
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
they take on that responsibility until
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
such time that they appoint
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
somebody representative eel um just
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
getting back again to the to the uh
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
feeling of the localities to how it all
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
rolled out do you I mean you've G you've
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
shared your views do you think there's
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
response groups in the towns I mean if
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
not that's fine but I was just curious
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I think um my recommendation would
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
be um that I believe that was part of
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
the scope of the the after action so I
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
think that there's probably some let's
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
see what comes out of the the report
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
report mechanism and and then go from
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
there just as a fall is there a an orc
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
chart for horand security just so we
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
could sort of see I'm is it is it
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
closely held or is it something we could
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
see we we certainly can provide that to
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
you that's not a big deal I just think
 
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting for us to kind
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
of understand this it can give you a
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
broad broad um broad level overview
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
leus you said 8 million dollar had come
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
as still part of the cleanup can you
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
explain what type of things that that is
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
will will be spent for that that was in
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
one month that was in one month for 15
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
disasters right so probably for this
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee's view you the the question if
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
I was sitting on your side of the table
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
would be uh do you have an estimate as
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
to what the covid-19 response Public
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
Assistance was for the State of New
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that number is over 300
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
million doll and and I guess partly I
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
was wondering if that's continuing to
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
come in because you said we're still
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
cleaning that up what type of things is
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
that being used for so those are the
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
money that is coming in is now
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
supporting projects that have been
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
completed right so you had projects that
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
were done during the co resp bonds that
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
are being scope continue to be scoped
 
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
and put in and now funded on the
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
backside whether a hospital needed to
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
Pivot and make a an adjustment um
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
because of covid-19 to a uh filtration
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
system or they needed to bring in
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
Staffing from another area the federal
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
government is providing assistance to
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
basically keep the hospitals from going
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh bankrupt U from supporting the
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
covid-19 response okay thank you and the
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
local communities right so whether it's
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
an EMS agency or a fire department or or
 
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
Community there may have been things
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
that they did that were eligible to
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
receive compensation back because they
 
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
were tied directly to uh the covid-19
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
response okay thank you so it's kind of
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
retrospective money at this point it it
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
is a 100% reimbursement based process
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so speaking on the
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
dollars and the reimbursement um now we
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
heard from commissioner Caswell that
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh they handled a lot of the funds of
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
dispersing um
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
monies uh but when we're talking about
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals is the money coming in from
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
the state and then being dispersed to
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
the hospitals or is it being dispersed
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
directly to them I guess is my question
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
so um you're talking about two separate
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
buckets of money uh commissioner Caswell
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh deals with the arpa funds as they may
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
be called and we're dealing with the
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
disaster of public assistance program
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
the public assistance program flows
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
directly from the federal government to
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and then we
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
distribute it out uh and and that is all
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
done through uh payments um as projects
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
are awarded and then we help support uh
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
the local communities to make sure that
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
they're getting their projects and
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork and receipts and all those
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
things that are needed to get their
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
money back from the federal government
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
we support that and that's paid for
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
through that management costs that we
 
01:17:00.629 --> 01:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
talked about okay so it's uh that is
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
another aspect of what your department
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah handles um do any of these do these
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
contracts and these monies have to be
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
approved by the executive Council yes
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative e um so what's
 
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
going on at the federal level now um as
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
far as I mean are they doing sort of an
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
after action report on the pandemic uh
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
response and is that an ongoing process
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
have you guys been sent information more
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
information on best practices or what
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
what I guess I we're certainly not
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the federal government's
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
preparedness for the next pandemic but
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
what I was wondering is how much is
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
getting pushed down to the States or do
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
you anticipate more will be so I I
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that as the federal
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
government continues to look at the
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
response through the what we'll call the
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
next chapter is going to be the closeup
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
process to covid-19 and they start
 
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
looking at like hey what worked what
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
didn't work that will in turn Drive
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
change to programs like public
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
assistance you know why did it take uh
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh 24 months to get a payment back to a
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
local community that had to expend local
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars because they had an outbreak at
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
the local fire department and their EMS
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
agency would have not have been able to
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
be able to respond because all of their
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
workers were contaminated right so so
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
those types of changes the big picture
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
stuff that they're looking at we
 
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
stuff that they're looking at we
participate

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we participate in giving them
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
feedback in regards to like hey we
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
really need this to change to be more
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
Nimble uh our goal is to like cut down
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
on the number of steps uh and make sure
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we're getting money into the right
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
possible represent
 
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
leus so besides communities does that
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
include schools or do does that money
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
also come through through you your
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofits represent Vel um so I guess
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
my question was maybe um I was wondering
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
from a health standpoint if they must be
 
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
from a health standpoint if they must be
looking

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
at I I I just don't know you know like
 
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
all the different aspects of how a
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
country responds to a pandemic not just
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
how the funding is pushed out but you
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
know anyway it's multifaceted yeah I
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer to that question
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned before that guidance
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
would come down from FEMA and I I
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
understand that you weren't in this role
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
during covid so um bear with me
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
that do we just you kind of said we
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
so you have we had emergency
 
01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.460 align:start position:0%
so you have we had emergency
guidelines

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:28.470 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:29.669 align:start position:0%
guidelines
[Music]

01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
discerns if they're the right thing for
 
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
our state not only the right thing for
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
our state but is the information we're
 
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.470 align:start position:0%
our state but is the information we're
getting

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
accurate um so I guess is what how do we
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
discern the difference yeah
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
um I'll try
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'll try uh so as information comes down
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh that would come in uh and the
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups including uh heavily
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
relied on uh DHHS and you know we got to
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
know a couple of names very well um that
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
we saw each night talking about the the
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
science piece right um and and I'm sure
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that they were providing input as to
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
what was going to work in New Hampshire
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
um but I was not in the room at that
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
time so
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and you mentioned that you were in uh
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
Incident Management and public health um
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
which role were you in during the covid
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
response I was the uh Emergency
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
Management director uh for the town of
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
Hudson through the co response okay um
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
and in that
 
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.750 align:start position:0%
and in that
role

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
role
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
um you you mentioned that there was a
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
lot of positives that there was a lot of
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
communication with um the state um uh
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
and that we were able to um react pretty
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
quickly uh to the needs of the
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities which I think is
 
01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.910 align:start position:0%
municipalities which I think is
fantastic

01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
um but when you got
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
guidance from the
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
state do you have to implement the
 
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
guidance that is given or do you have
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
can you discern it uh take time to look
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
at it and see if it's it's what's best
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
for your community it would depend on
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
how it was
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
written if it was an executive order
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
that was coming down regarding something
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the Food Network you know we would
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
have to implement that there was you
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
know there was executive Waters that
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
came down and that's the way things
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
worked and that was okay because it
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
provided support when a community needed
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
to implement
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
something and then there were other
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
areas where we probably debated
 
01:22:55.199 --> 01:22:56.910 align:start position:0%
areas where we probably debated
at

01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
length so just want to clarify just for
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
myself so if something came down an
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
executive order came down anyone in the
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management uh position in a
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
town uh there was that was it I mean the
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
executive order was the executive order

01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
needed to be followed um if it was
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
guidance when and that's where the
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%

represent leus just to use Hudson as an
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
example since you were there and that's
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
town I'm just um I'm thinking about the
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
things that affected people in the
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
town more directly like who made the
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
decisions was that part of your job when
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
it came
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
to for instance during election time the
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
election time changed a lot how we ran
 
01:23:59.070 --> 01:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
them than how we'd always done elections
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
before so where did those was that you
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
and the moderator correct correct we
 
01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
provided support to the moderator by by
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
State Statute the moderator is in charge
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
of the election process
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
so figuring out how to run an election
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh in town meeting because we're a
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 2 community in Hudson at
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
that time how to run town meeting uh and

01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the moderator uh and supportive in
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
nature to him so you would have given
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
advice but he would have made the final
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
decisions as how to do it okay thank you
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
yep representative eel Y and who was the
 
01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
homeland security director at the time
 
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic the pandemic would have
 
01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
been Jennifer Harper okay and then how
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
many employees do you have now I'm just
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
curious um so I would tell you fully
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
filled which we are in
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh we should be about
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
85 um and we're probably running about
 
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh 17 vacancies today um
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
so and is that quite a few more than
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
what were in place during the pandemic
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
or is it about the same pretty
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
consistent it's about the same yeah
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent if there's any area
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
that has grown it has been the recovery
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
branch and that is uh because of the
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
number of uh disasters that they're
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
handling at this point point we
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
specifically have a team that manages
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
just the covid-19 projects um because
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're very
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
it anybody else have any questions for
 
01:25:42.199 --> 01:25:45.310 align:start position:0%
it anybody else have any questions for
the

01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
leus it's kind of a Statewide and
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
potentially a nationwide issue that all
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
the Departments everybody's seeing is
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
vacancies right and I'm wondering if you
 
01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.629 align:start position:0%
vacancies right and I'm wondering if you
had

01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:26:01.639 --> 01:26:03.669 align:start position:0%
had
specific

01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
um ideas as to
 
01:26:07.159 --> 01:26:08.950 align:start position:0%
um ideas as to
what

01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
is keeping you or from filling those
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
vacancies what are the issues that
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're running up against because that's
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
a general thing we need to address yeah
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
I think some of that is
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
um availability of
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
labor you know um if you look at
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
um Public Safety in general whether it's
 
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.709 align:start position:0%
um Public Safety in general whether it's
Emergency

01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
Emergency
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
Management uh fire police EMS and you
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
look at the uh number of applicants
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
available um when I took my first
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
entrance exam a couple days ago uh there
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
was 900 of us for three jobs in the city
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
of nashwa at that point that took the
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
exam um you have uh departments in the
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
state on the fir side of the house that
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
have rolling application periods right
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
now uh and they're not receiving any
 
01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
applications uh and and that's just from
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
the Avenue of like who's available and
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
what's a what's a requirement um and and
 
01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
some of that comes from the vacancy rate
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
comes from the covid-19 burnout per se
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh my my daughter is gainfully employed
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
as a nurse today uh and you know she
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have to she went to school
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
through Co
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the vacancy rate in
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
the hospitals that that's it's all
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
related um and we have a group actively
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
working internally on how to do
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention better uh to
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
make sure we're going out and we've
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
bolstered our intern program uh to make
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
sure we're bringing in college students
 
01:27:45.149 --> 01:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
to provide opportunities for them to
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
come in and learn about Emergency
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
Management uh plumouth State uh UNH uh

management programs are run through
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
there so we try to partner with them as

best we can um
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%

01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
at masks and face coverings and so forth
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
being helpful if you will in reducing
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
transmission of respiratory
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
infections including covid and I just
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that it's in a record
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
that we did look at this at least I did
 
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sharing with the community so you
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
folks can as well is that when you look
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
at mass and mass mandates and so forth
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's been some concern about the
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of those devices as well
 
01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
as the mandates themselves so I just
 
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
want to enter into the record that a
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review it's a 65-page
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
report I handed to the chair I thought
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
i' saved the printer so not to give
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
everyone if you will a um copy of the
 
01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
full report I do have a copy for
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
everyone which is the first couple Pages
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
report thank you representa Merchant and
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
if you could just uh if you have a
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
chance to email the comprehensive report
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the spe the committee uh that would
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
be wonderful and that way we can make
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
sure that um it gets uploaded uh when
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
all the other documents get uploaded
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
into the uh website so that we have that
 
01:36:21.199 --> 01:36:23.830 align:start position:0%
into the uh website so that we have that
there

01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
you do you want to have any further
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
discussion on this or are you all set or
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
no just I know if the committee wanted
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
to uh speak to this or at all or wanted
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
some time to digest it and come back
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
whenever we come back and talk about the
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
merits of the report and how it fits
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
into what we are trying to accomplish
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
here with our committee absolutely um
 
01:37:05.679 --> 01:37:06.750 align:start position:0%
here with our committee absolutely um
represent

01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and I i'
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
I've just barely started to review this
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
a little bit but uh I I want to see if
 
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the same as as other
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
people's understanding on this which is
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is a uh retrospective meta
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
analysis um of various study is looking
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
at masking and its effect on the uh
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
transmission of um respiratory
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
viruses um both in the clinical and
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
separately in the non-clinical public
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
settings and if I may summarize what I'm
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm finding is that according to
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
this study and I I haven't had a chance
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
to dive deep into it but the the summary
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
suggests that the findings are that um
 
01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:53.830 align:start position:0%
suggests that the findings are that um
non-surgical

01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
non-surgical
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
fairly high level n95 and higher masks
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
that are done through proper fit testing
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
do have the capacity to reduce
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
transmission uh but it does not have
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
those findings for surgical or cloth or
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
other U masks that were generally
 
01:38:11.589 --> 01:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
available to the public during the
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic is that is that correct I think
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
it's a fair statement I would say that
 
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
what they're referring to is when you
 
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
use an appropriate mask and you use it
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately it does reduce the
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
transmission so that's really the C of
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
the report and I want to be clear about
 
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
that we're not talking about a cloth
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
covering we're talking about it
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
n95 thank you and represent
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
catean um thanks this is um actually the
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
one that I had sent out as well um there
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
should be an email with a nice actually
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
T Twitter thread from the first author
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
um that kind of like walks through the
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
the findings if anyone's interested in
 
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
that or or would find that maybe easier
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I did want to
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
highlight from this I think they do a
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
really good job of walking through some
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the challenges in um doing real world
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
tests of of masking um particularly a
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
lot of the you know studies that they
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
looked at um difficult to I guess look
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
at the outcomes because they're looking
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
at you know adherence rates of you know
 
01:39:18.189 --> 01:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
40% things like that so it is really
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
hard to tell um how effective even those
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
like cloth masks are um they
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
did do a
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
fairly um or sorry they they did mention
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
one study that was like a community
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
study that was done in Bangladesh that
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
they highlight as having had um better
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
methodology I think than some of the
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
other studies that were out there and
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
showed that even with like an uptake
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
rate of 45% or something like that in
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
the community related to 10% in the
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
non-intervention group um they did see
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
significant um reductions in
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
transmission reductions in deaths and um
 
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
symptomatic illness during covid um
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
so sorry even even partial uptake of uh
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
some of the available masks did have uh
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
an effect they said although obviously
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
n95s are better hopefully I'm
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
articulating that well if I can follow
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
up on the comment if you look at one of
 
01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:26.199 align:start position:0%
the key factors they talked about in
 
01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:29.719 align:start position:0%
here was that it does provide a social
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
cultural symbol to remind people the
 
01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
importance of what's going on so even
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
though per se it may not be 100%
 
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
effective in transmission of the disease
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
or the respiratory infection it does
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
provide a reminder to people about the
 
01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
seriousness of what we're talking about
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
so from a social point of view and a
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
cultural point of view there is barit
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
that in of in of in of it by itself
 
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I think that uh for
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
me I'm going to have to take some time
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
to uh really look at this and review it
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of information to go over so
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
um maybe when we come back in September
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
um we can have this as a topic of uh
 
01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representative eel yeah I
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to thank uh representative
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant and chisan for their for
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
bringing this forth I mean I think we've
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
had a lot of
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from folks who uh
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
questioned uh some of the standard
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
operating procedure during the pandemic
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccin the vaccine policies or the
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination policies the masking
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
policies I don't think we've had much
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've taken that has sort
 
01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
of uh supported how the government did
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
roll out its programs so this is one bit
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
of evidence that I think is really
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to consider and I and I
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
do very much look forward to this after
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
action report that they're preparing now
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
I think uh from a science-based
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint I'll be really helpful
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh representative beler did
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
introduce oh we you have a letter that
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh sorry I spaced out on that one for a
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
second thank you um so as as we had
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
previously discussed um we had
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
considered the idea of sending out um
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
a committee request for information um
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
documents and whatnot based on some of
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony we've received so we can
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
have a a more complete picture um and
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
take more things into consideration
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
within our record so I've drafted up a
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh something to consider um sending off
 
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
to the uh federal government
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
particularly the uh Departments of uh uh
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
Federal Food and Drug Administration as
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
well as the Centers for Disease Control
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
and prevention um requesting simply
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
asking questions of them and requesting
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
some information regarding such things
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
as um their vsafe um data uh and the
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
like um so everyone should have a copy
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
of that represent Merchant thank you
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for bringing
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
this letter to us uh representative
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
Belcher I have a fundamental question is
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
how this letter ties back into the
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
charge that was provided to us than the
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
RSA because I look at the charge and
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
I'll read it to the committee
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
collectively the bipartisan committee
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
has tasked with investigating and
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating the state's response to co I
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how this is going to help us
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
with the evaluation of the state's
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
response I think it gets into maybe the
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
validity of the resources the state used
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
to respond to it but I don't know how it
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
actually supports our underlying Mission
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
here which is to respond to the state
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
and how the state responded to it versus
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
dealing with the tools or the
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
resources the state had available to it
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
and how they were utilize so this to me
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
is more about what tools we had
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
available versus how we utilize the
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
tools so help me understand that um I I
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
represent beler do you want to go ahead
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
yes I I would be absolutely happy to
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
address that um and so as we've heard so
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
so frequently in testimony from
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
organizations as diverse as today from
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Homeland Security to
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
um very much of the the St in point for
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
the recommendations made by uh our state
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
agencies as a part of this Co response
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
originated with federal agencies and
 
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
involved um Federal uh law and actions
 
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
um and in this particular case we we
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
know that the Department of Health and
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
Human Services um was reliant on
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming from both the CDC
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
as well as the FDA and others regarding
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
its particular recommendations for covid
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
vaccination if you if you were to now go
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
to the um website for the New Hampshire
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh you will find that they are
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
recommending um the covid vaccine for
 
01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
certain age groups and in certain
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances um and this was something
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
that began in the immediate roll out of
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
these uh of the vaccines and other and
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
other products um and if you look
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
currently at the recommendations for
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
children on the New Hampshire Department
 
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services website
 
01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
regarding the covid-19 vaccines they
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
link directly to the CDC recommendations
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
as their own recommendations so in this
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
case there's really very little daylight
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
between what was being recommended in
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
the official actions of the State of New
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what was coming down as as
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations and in some cases
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps more than recommendations
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh from the federal government um and
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
further this request ties directly into
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
um testimony we received in order to try
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
to determine the veracity of the
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
testimony the genuiness of some of the
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
documents we've been provided um and
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
fill in some of the gaps that may be
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
present in that information thank you
 
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:16.390 align:start position:0%
present in that information thank you
represent

01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you for that it helps me
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
to understand your point of view I will
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
say I totally disagree with it I think
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
it's outside of the scope of this
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee it is talking about the merits
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
the veracity of the resources which are
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
determined by the quote federal
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
government um as so I wanted to talk to
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
represent sorry director Bexton be clear
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
we not here I don't believe talk about
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
the policy issues but dealing with the
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
response which is dealing things
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
operationally and to me this is getting
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
more into a policy discussion than it is
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
to an operational discussion about how
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
the state responded to it so that's what
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand is that I see
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
this is really going beyond the scope of
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
our committee and therefore I I can't
 
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.990 align:start position:0%
our committee and therefore I I can't
support

01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.030 align:start position:0%
support
it

01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
so in testimony um one of the things
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
we're tasked with is the emergency youth
 
01:47:13.159 --> 01:47:15.270 align:start position:0%
we're tasked with is the emergency youth
auth

01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
auth
 
01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.750 align:start position:0%
auth
authorization

01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the questions is is
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
given and I guess maybe this be question
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
for DHHS is did they look at the data or
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
did they just accept that it was an
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
emergency use
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
authorization when there was testing out
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
there and data out
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
was not known to the public um but yet
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
these agencies knew about it they were
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
doing testing um and then they were
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
changing their protocols which would fly
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
in the face of a science-based
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
um you know when you're collecting
 
01:48:12.589 --> 01:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
science you have a couple of pro
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
protocols that you're following so that
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
you can get your answers and if you
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
don't like your answers you just you
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't change Midstream and one of the
 
01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.589 align:start position:0%
don't change Midstream and one of the
things

01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
um that we're talking about and that
 
01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
represent Bel was talking about was
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
vsafe um and that was concerning so I
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
guess the question is is when it comes
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
to an emergency use authorization and
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
we're following as the state a
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
directive from the federal
 
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
government are we Discerning that or are
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
they giving us all the are they giving
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
our agencies the accurate information so
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
that they can do what's best for our
 
01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.350 align:start position:0%
that they can do what's best for our
state

01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of intertwined
 
01:48:56.239 --> 01:48:58.030 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of intertwined
unfortunately

01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
um but it goes to the emergency use
 
01:49:03.310 --> 01:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
authorization portion of this um and
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
with Federal guidance um
 
01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
and we need as a committee need to
 
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
understand did the federal government
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
withhold information from our
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
agencies because if they weren't giving
 
01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
all the facts how could they have
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
best how could any anybody in the state
 
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
do what's best for its citizens if
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
they're not giving all the
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
facts so representative leus
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative eel and then represent
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
Merchant um if you have bad policy it
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how good you're or great
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
or fantastic your implementation is if
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
you have bad policy bad things are going
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
to happen so I think it's very important
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
for us to look at how we evaluated the
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
policy you know did we just take
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else's word for it and not look
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
at it and just implement it or did we
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
actually and do we have in place a way
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
of evaluating those policies coming from
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
outside of our state to
 
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
determine you know is that appropriate
 
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
is that appropriate for us Etc and I
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
think unless we look at the policies and
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
the way they were
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
evaluated and Etc we could end up going
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
down in the future a very bad Road
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly implementing very bad policy
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that's what we did but I
 
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
think that's why I think it's important
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
to look at both policy and
 
01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.589 align:start position:0%
to look at both policy and
procedure

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
represent um thank you and in I I
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
do agree with representative Merchant I
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
feel that this is outside the scope of
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
our view I understand that the actions
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
that were being taken were were
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
basically undergirded by the by the
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
federal advice that we were given but
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
that was the basically the land of the
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
lay of the land during the pandemic and
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we were dealing with um as
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
far as the letter itself is concerned um
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
I I really appreciate the thought and
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
the effort that went into it but the
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry is basically a Freedom of
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
Information Act inquiry I think if it's
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
going to go forward it should be handed
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
l in that way number one um I can't
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
imagine uh and then looking at the end
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
of it we we want we request access to
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
all Communications from any Personnel
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
within your agencies to all of these
 
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
questions posed from all periods 2020 to
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
the present I mean I just can't even
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
imagine the mountain of information uh
 
01:51:48.669 --> 01:51:48.679 align:start position:0%
that we are requesting how long it would
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
take for this to be processed and what
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
we would even do with it if we got all
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
the information that we're requesting I
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
mean we're I certainly feel totally
 
01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
incapable of assessing um the
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
information that we would be getting and
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
I I just I am not uh comfortable sending
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
this out as a request from the committee
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
if there are committee members that want
 
01:52:19.709 --> 01:52:19.719 align:start position:0%
to pursue it on on their own I mean
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's obviously their right but I'm not
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this letter coming from
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you and represent
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
poof thank you madam chair uh uh I agree
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
with your point and I agree with uh
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative leas we we need to be
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
based on uh correct scientific decisions
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
and uh that's why uh we want uh to have
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh data on both sides on vacc in
 
01:52:56.910 --> 01:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
efficacy and uh if you say it's not
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
relevant like but it's the same with
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
masks so if you read uh the hands outs
 
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
for mask sufficiency none of these
 
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:07.639 align:start position:0%
papers say New
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it doesn't say New Hampshire
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
response but it's relevant for us
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
because we want to our decisions to
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
based on uh correct policy regarding
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
masks Effectiveness or respirator
 
01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.589 align:start position:0%
masks Effectiveness or respirator
effective

01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
so just the same way as uh this mask
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
review is relevant to our mission uh I
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
see this letter is also relevant to our
 
01:53:41.229 --> 01:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
mission just on different
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
policy representative beler then
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you madam
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
chair I just I would just respond to
 
01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
some of the um the arguments that have
 
01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
been made which I I understand I think
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
the perspective of um but I I would
 
01:53:56.189 --> 01:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that within our our statement
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
for the for the mission of this
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee and the description and what
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
we've undertaken um there there is
 
01:54:04.069 --> 01:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
nothing that I can see that would uh
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
remotely limit us um from being able to
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
look at policy and what policies were
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
adopted and why policies were adopted in
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
fact the charge of the legislature
 
01:54:15.629 --> 01:54:15.639 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution is really twofold um the
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
first one being uh the purse strings we
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
we have the funding capacity of the
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
state and the second um being the
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
creation of public policy and uh of
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
course oversight as well um so I I don't
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
see any any um reason to
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
artificially uh limit the jurisdiction
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the house as is
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
constitutionally granted for policy
 
01:54:42.159 --> 01:54:44.109 align:start position:0%
constitutionally granted for policy
oversight

01:54:44.109 --> 01:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
um in uh in in this particular manner um
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
and I and I believe I would note and I
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
I'll have to pull it up because I I I
 
01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's um not specifically house
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
rules but it falls under the um Mason's
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
Manual of legislative um uh rules um
 
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
Manual of legislative um uh rules um
that

01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's within the uh discretion and
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction or discretion and authority
 
01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
of a committee chair um to make a
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
request on behalf of the committee um
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
just a request not a not a subpoena or
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature here but just a
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
request uh for information thank
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
you represent Merchant thank you madam
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
chair I'll make three points
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
one for us to go back and to
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
evaluate whatever needed to be done with
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
covid implies as a state we have the
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
resources to do it so unless this
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislative body wants to fund a major
 
01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
major I mean major body with scientists
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
and so forth to re-evaluate what's going
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
on with the federal government I don't
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
think we have the resources to do it
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
number two if we do that's a complete
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
redundancy and it goes against taxpayer
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
dollars and spending them wisely number
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
two is going to be a mountain of data I
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
don't know about you folks I don't have
 
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
the expertise to evaluate that data
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be in front of us and I
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
don't know where we're going to get the
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
resources unless again we're going to
 
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
fund those resources and somebody wants
 
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
to Pony up if we have the first strings
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
we have the authority back to legisl
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
body and ask for the hundreds of
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars that we need to
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
make this thing work and number four as
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
far as the Constitutional I don't
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with representative beler we do
 
01:56:30.910 --> 01:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional Authority and so
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
forth but what I'm going back to is the
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
law that we passed if we wanted to talk
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
about policy when we passed the law we
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
should have been included it in the
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
policy at the time when we passed the
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
RSA we did not we talk about the
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
response to it not the evaluation of the
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
resources that were going to be utilized
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
so that was the time to talk about what
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do as a committee and what
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do is a legislative body
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
with the oversight that was a time to
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
debate it on the floor and have that
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
discussion we did not we talked about
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
how we're going to respond to it so that
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
goes back to the policy and for those
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
reasons I cannot support this letter and
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
I would move this this committee before
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
it even sends out this letter it goes to
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
the house speaker for clarification for
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
Speaker represent P off represent
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
like uh I appreciate concern for tax
 
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
space funds and I would agree if uh this
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
letter was demanding to create a new
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
system to track vaccine safety like vve
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
but this letter doesn't demand creating
 
01:57:34.079 --> 01:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
but this letter doesn't demand creating
of

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
vve it just asks
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
about data that as we know was produced
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
through vve so it's not about additional
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
expenditures from taxpayer uh money but
 
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the opposite it's about the
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
utilization of the systems that was
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
already funded by taxpayers and
 
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are entitled to those answers
 
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
funded representative
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
leus I'm going back to
 
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.870 align:start position:0%
the policy
part

01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
um different states resp responded very
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
differently with the same federal
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines because different states
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
checked it out differently there were
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
Governors um who actually read all the
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
read the
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
studies um had meetings with for
 
01:58:46.109 --> 01:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
instance the doctors who
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
said they use these different protocols
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
to great effect some of which we've
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
heard from
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
about um and having done that they went
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
against what the federal government was
 
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
saying and went based on what they
 
01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
themselves were learning from other than
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
just the federal government like from
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
doctors who had great success and
 
01:59:11.550 --> 01:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
changed their protocols and changed
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
their rules um and so I think it's
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
important that we think about in any
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
response in the future how we're going
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
to do that instead of just taking
 
01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:24.510 align:start position:0%
to do that instead of just taking
one

01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
person one person's recommendations in
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government but to actually
 
01:59:32.430 --> 01:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
look at the big picture how are we going
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
to do that and how are we going to
 
01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
evaluate because as we've seen
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
now some of that advice Not only was
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
wrong we are hearing in the news lately
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
where they're admitting that yeah they
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
kind of knew it was wrong um and so
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I think we need to be
 
01:59:57.030 --> 01:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about how we are going to
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate what advice we're getting to
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what we're going to do in the
 
02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
future representative
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
eil thank you I still even aside from
 
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
all of that policy operational issue I'm
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
looking at this request it's like again
 
02:00:19.069 --> 02:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
I I respect what you did but it's
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
enormous I mean access to all
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
communication from any Personnel within
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
your agencies for the last four years I
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
mean that's enormous and all the data on
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
all these different programs I really I
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
I don't even know what we I don't I
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how long it would take to
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
comply with this request I don't know
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
how expensive it would be for the feds
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
to put together the response to this
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
request I'm not sure how we would ever
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
have the capability to review
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
all of the information um and we have
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
very limited I mean I certainly have
 
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
limited medical capacity to review it
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just even if you just set aside
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
whether you think it's right or wrong to
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
send this letter this request is just
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
unbelievably um Broad and and and I I
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
can't support it so it's almost noon I
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
think what we have to do is decide I
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
mean if you want to take a vote Vote or
 
02:01:25.229 --> 02:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
or or whatever or if you want to take a
 
02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
shot at refining the letter um but I I
 
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
can't support it as it is representative
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you m chair um if we want
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
to as a committee and I'm following up
 
02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
on represent
 
02:01:43.709 --> 02:01:43.719 align:start position:0%
leas I don't disagree as far as the
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
issue of the policy but I think if you
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
want to include in the review in
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
saying how did we as a state review the
 
02:01:51.599 --> 02:01:52.750 align:start position:0%
saying how did we as a state review the
information

02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:01:55.149 --> 02:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
that's internal to us not so much the
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
validity of the data coming to us but
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
how do we internally look at data that
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
we receive and evaluate its merits
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's different than going back to the
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
federal government asking for the source
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
of data and doing unnown analysis but
 
02:02:11.069 --> 02:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the process is saying what's
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
the process we have in the state to
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
evaluate this information to ensure that
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing the right thing and I think
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
that has merits to it and number two
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
when you start looking at the end result
 
02:02:25.149 --> 02:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
and I keep going back to this to our
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee I use the number of deaths per
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
100,000 and I am proud to say that as a
 
02:02:35.229 --> 02:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
state we were the second lowest in the
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
country the only one lower than us was
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hawaii because they could lock down the
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
island so when you start looking at the
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
use of the Poli the information there
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
are other states I don't disagree they
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the same logic that we had
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
here but you can see where the variance
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
and what it created so if you're looking
 
02:02:56.350 --> 02:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
at the end result being deaths and
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
people survived which to me is
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
critical then I think we did a fa a good
 
02:03:04.589 --> 02:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
job in using the information we had but
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
if you want to go back and say what's
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
the process we do internally because a
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
lot of ways that's to me is more key
 
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
than trying to get down all this
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
like I think part of this part of our
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
assignment is looking at not deaths but
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
other like we've seen in the education
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
field huge harms that were done based on
 
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
policies that were followed that were
 
02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:33.510 align:start position:0%
policies that were followed that were
now

02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
finding uh the people who suggested
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
those policies actually knew they were
 
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
not effective and would not work and we
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
are seeing those harms and part of it is
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
not just deaths but what are the other
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
harms were there harms to businesses
 
02:03:54.669 --> 02:03:54.679 align:start position:0%
were there harms how many people died
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
not from covid but from despair you know
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
the um suicide rate went way up what
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
could we what could we have done
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
differently to keep that from happening
 
02:04:12.589 --> 02:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
um kids like two years behind
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
developmentally Etc could we have done
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
things differently what did we need to
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
look at and and um I think those are I
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
was I'm talking more of the
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
general because comments are made of the
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
general what we as a committee should be
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
doing not so much the specific
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
letter I was saying I was talking about
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
our general not so much the specific
 
02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
some for us to be able to make
 
02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
decisions based on what other
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
organizations did I think important for
 
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
us to understand how those organizations
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
work because you know that'll that'll
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
affect okay is this should we trust
 
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
everything coming out of here or should
 
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
we be asking questions um Etc from
 
02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
we be asking questions um Etc from
different

02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
organizations but I do agree that when
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
it comes to this that last sentence
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
further we would request access to all
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
community that that is just I agree
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's way overboard way overboard but
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
the the original stuff were really just
 
02:05:26.669 --> 02:05:26.679 align:start position:0%
asking we had testimony
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
supposedly about this organization so do
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
we believe with that testimony do do we
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
search it a little farther and find out
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
can we get verification from that
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
organization I think that's a reasonable
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
thing for us to
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
do representative Evo um oh gosh now I
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
just looked at at representative
 
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant and completely lost my my train
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
of thought um but I thought you actually
 
02:05:55.870 --> 02:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
no I know what it was you had a um I
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the discussion I I
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
think though you had a good point
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant when you said
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
maybe another way of looking at this is
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
not so much as trying to take a really
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
deep dive that that is going to be very
 
02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to do um on what the
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
federal decisions were but maybe talk a
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
little bit more with the public health
 
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
people and understand that when these
 
02:06:24.669 --> 02:06:24.679 align:start position:0%
policies come down do you exercise
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
independent judgment how how are those
 
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
policies that you're getting and The Dru
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the instructions that you're getting
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
how are they assessed and I I mean and I
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised if they said this
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
was a pandemic we were in like you know
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic mode and we didn't have a lot
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
of time to sit back and assess
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
everything um but then we could say okay
 
02:06:54.549 --> 02:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
well in a similar situation like this
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
what sort of um policies could we put in
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
place that would give some structure to
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of analysis that you might want
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
to do I mean that sort of thing but this
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
is an enormous um task uh to to dive
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
into it at this this level and maybe we
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
might even just want to wait until we
 
02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
see the after action report from
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and then uh take
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
action following
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
belch thank you madam chair just to
 
02:07:30.189 --> 02:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
speak to a couple of the issues that
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
been brought up including the the the
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan concern here that uh
 
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
accessing the communications records for
 
02:07:40.589 --> 02:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
the anything um responsive to the other
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
questions asked here and I I just want
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
to point out that it's only been about
 
02:07:49.709 --> 02:07:49.719 align:start position:0%
about two weeks um since nationally the
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
uh Federal Department of Health and
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services took the rather extreme
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
step of sanctioning to the point of
 
02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:00.229 align:start position:0%
step of sanctioning to the point of
permanent

02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
disqualification the organization's ecoh
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
Health Alliance and its uh proprietor uh
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
Peter daik who were involved in um
 
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
Corona virus gain of function
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
research they took these extreme steps
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
against this organization which direct
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
directly relates to pandemic response
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
and the whole issue we're looking at
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
they took this extreme step not based on
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
the information that they were provided
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
based on questions asked to this
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
organization but because they got a hold
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
of this organization's internal
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
Communications and found discrepancies
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
between what they were being told and
 
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
what was happening internally in the
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
organizations where they discovered
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
malfeasance and the purposeful
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
withholding of information that may have
 
02:08:51.069 --> 02:08:51.079 align:start position:0%
been critical at an early point in this
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic and that's that's the reason I
 
02:08:55.709 --> 02:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
I um I included that particular thing
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking for every bit of
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
communications from the entire agencies
 
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
during that period only those that are
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
responsive to the handful of questions
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
that are posed within this document um
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
it may be a substantial tranch of of
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
data I would be happy to parse it I
 
02:09:11.069 --> 02:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
think if we lack the internal resources
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
I think that a um a sort of um what's it
 
02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:17.559 align:start position:0%
called the socially networked review of
 
02:09:19.709 --> 02:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
it could bring anything important to
 
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
light for us um and frankly I I think
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
without those docu without access to
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
internal Communications I I see almost
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
no point in even asking these questions
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
because we have to be able to verify the
 
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
veracity of them um by seeing what they
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
were talking about internally as you
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
know a contemporary to the decisions
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
being made um and I I would say given
 
02:09:48.669 --> 02:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
that there is obviously
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
some uh debate over where the authority
 
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
lies for sending a letter like this I I
 
02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
would recommend do we perhaps consult
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
with the parliamentarian to see just
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
what what his input is on it I I would
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
if I can Mr yes I would strongly
 
02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:07.559 align:start position:0%
recommend that because if we're going to
 
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
send something to a federal government
 
02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
and we don't per se even have the
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
authority to send a letter it's not only
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to fall flat when they receive it
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to make us look in a bad
 
02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
light and if we don't have the
 
02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:23.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction within our legislative body
 
02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
and I like to have someone put that
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
forth and saying yes we do or we do not
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
because if we don't we shouldn't be
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
sending the letter at all that's the
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
first question the other one's going to
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
be when all this information comes back
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
if it ever comes back are we going to
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
get it back in time to evaluate it
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
before a report due by November 1st and
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
on top of that I want to say rest Bel I
 
02:10:49.629 --> 02:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
want thank you for willing to dive into
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
a mountain of paperwork uh to do it but
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from my point of view I
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the expertise I'd like to
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
send it to my social network but a lot
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
of the people in my social network don't
 
02:11:02.350 --> 02:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to really look at the
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
documents themselves and make that
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation so without having someone who
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
truly has your credentials to look at
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
that information coming back to us I'm
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
not sure what we can do with
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
it so I agree and I would never send out
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
a letter like this without checking with
 
02:11:22.189 --> 02:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office first off just so
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
everyone understands
 
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
um the biggest question I have and I
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
would really really like an answer to Is
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
the vve
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
data I think after the what we heard
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
that hearing I have so many questions
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
and I want to know
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
they decided and we heard in testimony
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
and it was shown to us and I actually
 
02:12:01.709 --> 02:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
have some of the slides that I have to
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
send off to the committee from that
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
presentation so I'll get those uh P
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
slides out to everyone um but why in the
 
02:12:13.149 --> 02:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
middle of doing a
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
scientific protocol they change
 
02:12:19.549 --> 02:12:19.559 align:start position:0%
Midstream to mimic another agency when
 
02:12:22.109 --> 02:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
they're two separate agencies
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
to me that is the biggest question when
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
the data was reflecting something that
 
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't what they wanted based
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
on what we saw but I want to know
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
myself if it's you know I'm told that
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's factual but I want to verify it I
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
always like to verify what I
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
have Madam chair I would totally I think
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
that if we can narrow this down to that
 
02:12:47.679 --> 02:12:49.149 align:start position:0%
that if we can narrow this down to that
one

02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
issue okay then the scope of the
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
information coming back is going to be
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
minimal compared to the other mountain
 
02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
of data and at that point in time based
 
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
upon that we can probably find some
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
resource internally within the state to
 
02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
evaluate it but if this letter as
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
written is so broad the scope is Way
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
Beyond this committee but if you want to
 
02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
narrow it down to strictly that one
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
issue and that one issue only and you
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
also go to the speaker's office
 
02:13:15.910 --> 02:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian to be sure that we as a
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
committee and particular yourself as the
 
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
chair who signs off on it that you have
 
02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
the authority to do that
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
I um would absolutely never send
 
02:13:27.149 --> 02:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
anything out without the authority of
 
02:13:28.589 --> 02:13:28.599 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office or the
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian um ever um but I
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
think that narrowing the scope of this
 
02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
would May ensure not guarantee that we
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
may get data back over the summer in
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
time for the report um and I had like I
 
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
said I had so many more questions um
 
02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
about the testing of this and the
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
decisions made by the different
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
departments um and this was of
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
particular concern to me because it
 
02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:05.470 align:start position:0%
particular concern to me because it
would

02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
affect um basically it could affect how
 
02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
every state handled things um
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
technically and representative crean
 
02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
cran has a
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
question I guess um just with respect to
 
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
requesting V and there is data um that's
 
02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
actually all like publicly available you
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
can just go online and get it so um I
 
02:14:31.149 --> 02:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to necessarily
 
02:14:34.549 --> 02:14:34.559 align:start position:0%
request those data um certainly just
 
02:14:37.229 --> 02:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
want to mention that in interpreting
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
those data um it's really key to keep in
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
mind that these are all just reports
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
that people make
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
voluntarily um there's nothing to verify
 
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
accurate um certainly
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
not saying that this was a common thing
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
but I certainly saw you know on social
 
02:14:58.350 --> 02:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
media people saying they shouldn't be
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
pushing vaccines we got to
 
02:15:04.030 --> 02:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
flood these reports with you know
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
information about data so I think that
 
02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:09.559 align:start position:0%
those might not be the most useful data
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
for us to look at when
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
considering side effects and efficacy as
 
02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know information from
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals that that sort of thing um
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then finally just just um to this
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
idea of the control group receiving a
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine um at some point after the
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine was approved um my understanding
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that's like a pretty common thing
 
02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
because when you're doing a clinical
 
02:15:39.149 --> 02:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
trial if you see that there's evidence
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
of efficacy it becomes an ethical issue
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
to withhold um the effective treatment
 
02:15:47.229 --> 02:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
from the control group so um I don't
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
think that's something that we should I
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
I think um
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
harping on that would reveal a lack of
 
02:15:56.589 --> 02:15:56.599 align:start position:0%
understanding on our part and I would
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
not sign on to that so I understand
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
about the their's data where that's
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary a lot but the vsafe data was
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
only given to people that received the
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
actual vaccine it was a very
 
02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
controlled uh group of I think it was
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
was it
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
10,000 I believe 40, whatever but and
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
the data was populated but it was only
 
02:16:26.549 --> 02:16:26.559 align:start position:0%
for those that were vaccinated so it's
 
02:16:26.559 --> 02:16:27.629 align:start position:0%
for those that were vaccinated so it's
very

02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:16:32.589 --> 02:16:32.599 align:start position:0%
specific and um so that data was
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
specific and the other thing was how the
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
FDA and the CDC they had
 
02:16:43.709 --> 02:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
protocols on what scientific method each
 
02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
group was going to
 
02:16:49.389 --> 02:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
do and one of the Midstream and I'm not
 
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
sure which agency was switched over to
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
the other one and disregarded everything
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
else that they had gotten that is of
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
concern because
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
that so yes Madam chair I think we're we
 
02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
could go in this is saying when that
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
happened between the agencies and there
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
was a change I'd asked the question to
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
the people at the state level how did
 
02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
that impact your assessment because I
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be how we responded
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
to the information that was provided to
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
us versus a source of the information
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
and I think that's more critical than
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
looking at going through mountains of
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
data is asking our state resources how
 
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
do we utilize information what's the
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
process how do we evaluate it and when
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
something gets switched from One agent
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
to another what did you do to me that
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
makes more sense than trying to go out
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
this it's a rabbit hole and I'd rather
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
look at it and saying I got the rabbit I
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to find the hole is talk to
 
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
the person at the point in time it's
 
02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services May
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's Ben Chen Dr Chen is what did you do
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
and why' you do it that to me has more
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
merriage to it than this whole letter
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
well this is only based on one person's
 
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
testimony as well that's all we
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
leus I think to even be able to do that
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
we have to understand what
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
information they had so we've found out
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
now due to all of the um requests that
 
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
he's made and everything that these
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
things happened but did we even know
 
02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
that did they even let us know that they
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
changed their policies seems like that
 
02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
would be something that's important for
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
us to to know because if we're not
 
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
getting information from these agencies
 
02:18:40.509 --> 02:18:40.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
that I I can't hear
 
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
you I guess I'm my concern is going to
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
be as legislators it's not for us to
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
have that information is more for the
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
people who are we rely upon that we put
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
in positions that have that Authority is
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
how they use that information again it's
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
back to how the state responded by using
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
the information because I want to know
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
how the state responded and how they
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
evaluated the information they were
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
utilizing to me that's more critical
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
than this whole issue of the FDA and CDC
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
and so forth that's that's what I'm
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get to well what I'm saying
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
is if they're not getting the
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
information they should be getting they
 
02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
may be responding perfectly to the
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
information they got but we have
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
this a lot of information that has come
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
out later that said these things were
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
happening that nobody knew about at the
 
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
time and so were our agencies
 
02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
basing their response on incomplete
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
information and how do we in the future
 
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
try to make sure they getting complete
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
information I think it refers to
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
something called money Monday Morning
 
02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
Quarterback representative Belcher thank
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I just wanted to make a
 
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of a correction because I
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
think there was a bit of a misstatement
 
02:20:08.469 --> 02:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
regarding one of the questions that is
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
in here just to be clear this letter
 
02:20:17.469 --> 02:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
does not ask did these uh vaccine
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers immunize the control group
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
as a part during the study that's not
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
what this asks because that would be a
 
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
useless question because it last con it
 
02:20:29.230 --> 02:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
lacks context rather here's what the
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
question actually
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
asks can you verify the vaccination of
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
the control group occurring despite
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
objections from either of your agencies
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
now that's important because we receive
 
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
specific testimony that the vaccination
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
occurred over the objections of federal
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
regulators and that would be an an
 
02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
interesting point to know that might
 
02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
help us understand the the overall
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
picture here a little bit um so it's
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's a totally different issue than did
 
02:20:59.550 --> 02:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
they can vaccinate the control group
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
because of course they're always going
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
to eventually vaccinate the control
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
group if it's approved the key there is
 
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
did any of the agencies asked them not
 
02:21:10.750 --> 02:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate the control group and did
 
02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
they move forward with that over the
 
02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
represent po
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
off I just I want to return to previous
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
topic so I don't know if we are done
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
one uh just one second um right now
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
we're at an impass regarding the
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
letter I think that the first thing I'm
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
going to do is go to the speaker's
 
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
office and see if this is something that
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
we can send out as a
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
and once I get that then I guess the
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
next question is is do we refine the
 
02:22:01.950 --> 02:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
letter do we how do we move forward um
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
whether if he says yes or he says no I
 
02:22:07.710 --> 02:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
mean no is going to be pretty
 
02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh and that will end the
 
02:22:15.070 --> 02:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
discussion um so we'll just uh but if he
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
says yes then the next question is
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
is the drafting of the drafting of the
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
letter so won't be here
 
02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:26.830 align:start position:0%
letter so won't be here
[Music]

02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm I'm not exactly sure how to
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
move forward with that portion of it and
 
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
I've got multiple hands represent a Evel
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
represent beler represent a merchant
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay so all I can say is I've got to
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
leave at 12:30 but um
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
so one thing we could do in the meantime
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
is we could actually inquire of DHHS or
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
whomever and just say in the face of the
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
testimony that we receive that asserted
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
this um we'd be interested in you
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
developing you know an answer for us uh
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
you know whether you observe this
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
phenomenon whether this is just based on
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we happen to get I
 
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
mean you could ask them about this and
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
how they responded and that would get at
 
02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
how they responded and that would get at
this

02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
whole issue of of the response but the
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
other thing we can do is we can just
 
02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
wait and see what this after Action
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
Report says and what is in there um but
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be hard for us to
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
reach consensus on the letter over the
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
summer and the last thing I want to say
 
02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
is there's nothing that stands in the
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
way of an individual representative
 
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
requesting information themselves
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
through the foia process which both
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
these agencies
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
have thank you I do think that we need
 
02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
to definitely reach out to DHHS they I'm
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hope was hoping that once we get through
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
this section there's um some folks that
 
02:24:08.110 --> 02:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have in in the fall I'd like
 
02:24:12.429 --> 02:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
to have DHHS in again Dr Chan um some
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
people from special ed um even the
 
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor because I think um
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
dealing that um department has a lot to
 
02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
do with um the Federal Emergency dollars
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
and how the Ripple effects are still
 
02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
affecting us today with decisions that
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
have come down uh through that um so
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
leaving at that uh representative beler
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
then representative Merchant thank you
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair and um here's kind of how I
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm envisioning this and you can tell me
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
if you think I'm correct um I fully am
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
supportive of of going of course
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
Consulting the parliamentarian seeing
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
what the procedure in place is for for
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
an item like this I see a sort of
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
decision tree coming either it's going
 
02:25:01.630 --> 02:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
to be a uh we don't have the authority
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
which I I don't think is going to be the
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
answer but okay we're done number two um
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
we have the authority but it falls to a
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
vote of the house well that would mean
 
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's out for this year we have the
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
authority but it falls to a vote of the
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh which would have to wait
 
02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
till the next time week reconvene which
 
02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
will be in the fall which is probably
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
too late to submit this the last and
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
final which I see is probably the only
 
02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
way to proceed on this and is what I am
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
pretty sure actually is the correct
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
parliamentary rule is that the Authority
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
for this lies with the chair um in which
 
02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
case it would be on the discretion of of
 
02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:45.469 align:start position:0%
case it would be on the discretion of of
Madam

02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
chair if I may respond Madam chair I at
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
this time I don't think that would be
 
02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
feasible simply because we're not
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
meeting again until fall can I make a
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you madam chair I
 
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly legislative what you
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
can do I know when I was on the board uh
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
a Board of Pharmacy at the time when we
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
had something like this what the chair
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
could do was to draft something send it
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
to each one of us we could not resp to
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
all because it's 91a violation but we
 
02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
could respond individually to the chair
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
saying we approve or disapprove so it's
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
like taking a vote um without going
 
02:26:26.670 --> 02:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
through the process but it has to be
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
done in a way and it's is good talk to
 
02:26:30.030 --> 02:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
the parliamentarian because
 
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
legislatively I don't know what the
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
rules are but on the board we would send
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
out the draft each board member could
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
respond yay or nay and at that point in
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
time they can move forward if I may
 
02:26:44.429 --> 02:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
chair just to respond to that I am I can
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
just about guarantee that would uh that
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
would violate parliamentary procedure
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
because it would effectively represent a
 
02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
remote vote um if if it does in fact
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
require a vote I don't I don't think
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any way to move
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
forward with this I think the only path
 
02:26:59.230 --> 02:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
forward is if we do find it is at the
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair in which case
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's just that simple and I and I would
 
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with uh Madam chair
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
to accept any revisions or or plug
 
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
anything else in that that would be
 
02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate represent
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
black If instead of taking a vote yay or
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
nay what we do is communally
 
02:27:22.349 --> 02:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
um make
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions for making it better you
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
could do that and then Madam chair would
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to send it or not
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
that way it's still it's up to her which
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
she would have the authority for but she
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
would have the input from all of us the
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
the other was in the meantime if I can
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
ask the chair go back to represent
 
02:27:47.309 --> 02:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
Able's um question I would recommend the
 
02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
chair send a letter to the Department of
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services and saying what is
 
02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
the process when you receive information
 
02:27:55.469 --> 02:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
and you have possibly conflicting
 
02:27:58.670 --> 02:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
information how what's the process how
 
02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
do you decide how to move forward with
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
the policy based upon the information
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's provided to you A how do you
 
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
assess it B how do you utilize it to me
 
02:28:09.269 --> 02:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's more appropriate with our own
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
state agency coming from the chair
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
asking that fundamental question to the
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
department thank you for that represent
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
Merchant I I think it's important um and
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
the question is is I wouldn't assume
 
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
that they receive conflicting
 
02:28:25.469 --> 02:28:25.479 align:start position:0%
information they may not have um and
 
02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
maybe the question is is how did you
 
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
assess the information um instead of
 
02:28:32.590 --> 02:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
reading something into that
 
02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
represent I mean basically you can pose
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
the question to them that we got
 
02:28:39.269 --> 02:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
testimony from this person I mean we'll
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
have the slides or whatever and he
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
asserted x y and z um to your knowledge
 
02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
was that the situation and if it was the
 
02:28:50.830 --> 02:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
situation how did you respond you know
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
something like that I mean I think this
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
whole thing we're assessing obviously
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
but I also think it's just really
 
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
difficult because people were scrambling
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know trying to do their best
 
02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.150 align:start position:0%
you know trying to do their best
representative

02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
leus I know we keep saying people were
 
02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
scrambling but this was a two-year
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
response in the beginning I'm willing
 
02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
to I I'm willing to excuse any mistakes
 
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
that were made in the beginning because
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
clearly there was a lot we didn't know
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
and everybody was doing their best and I
 
02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
believe everybody was doing their best
 
02:29:26.110 --> 02:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
but there were a lot of decisions that
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
got made along the road where we weren't
 
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
scrambling where there was time and so
 
02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
those are the we need to look at that um
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is to ask them is
 
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
were they aware I mean did they know
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
this information because that's part of
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
what we want to see is where are we
 
02:29:48.030 --> 02:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
getting complete information where is
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
the breakdown in communication now we
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
see this and it's one thing to say how
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
did you respond to this but they might
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
not have even gotten this information
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
and so that would be a question to ask
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
them is we received testimony that this
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
is what
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
happened did you were you aware of this
 
02:30:07.870 --> 02:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
at all you know was this something that
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
even came across your plate for you to
 
02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.790 align:start position:0%
even came across your plate for you to
even

02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
even
consider

02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
represent the letter sort of lays out
 
02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
the some of the question questions right
 
02:30:23.230 --> 02:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
but I mean unfortunately we're in a
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
situation now where we're not meeting
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
over the summer and that's just know I'm
 
02:30:30.269 --> 02:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
not sure what we can do about that but
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
we can ask the question in the meantime
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
if we to right and I will speak with the
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh speaker um probably today if he's in
 
02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:41.710 align:start position:0%
uh speaker um probably today if he's in
and

02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh if and if not it'll be next week uh
 
02:30:49.389 --> 02:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
but anyways uh to to get an answer on
 
02:30:49.399 --> 02:30:50.590 align:start position:0%
but anyways uh to to get an answer on
this

02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's important and to
 
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
represent of leus Point yes at first
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
everyone was scrambling nobody knew what
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
was going on but 6 months in there was a
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
lot of conflicting information coming
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
out and um and then as we heard uh in
 
02:31:10.990 --> 02:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh The Honorable
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay um horable gay she
 
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
she um had some really good points to
 
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
make about um be because you know people
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
with different mindsets coming together
 
02:31:26.190 --> 02:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
to Hash it out because to me that's what
 
02:31:28.349 --> 02:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
makes the best policies okay because
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're taking in all points of view so I
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we understand
 
02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
that we all come are coming from a
 
02:31:37.870 --> 02:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
different uh perspective on this um
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
we've all we all experienced something
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
different during the
 
02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic and it's it's individual for
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
everybody um so I think in light of that
 
02:31:49.389 --> 02:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
I think sending something off to DHHS is
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
important but I will also consult the
 
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
speaker regarding the letter and I will
 
02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
let the committee know what the speaker
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
says representative paaz off does have
 
02:31:58.750 --> 02:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
something to
 
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
say Madame chair I I need to leave as
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
well I just want to say thank you for
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
chairing this and hopefully everyone has
 
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
a great summer and it's restful and
 
02:32:10.349 --> 02:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
relaxing after the community conferences
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
we had so but thank you for what you're
 
02:32:14.429 --> 02:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
doing yes thank you very much it's a
 
02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
good conversation uh thank you all I
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
know that some of you are leaving uh so
 
02:32:22.590 --> 02:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
but represent poov has uh you have the
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
floor yeah thank you Madame chair and
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant for
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
share data on review of mask
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness uh I I need to make sure
 
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
for the record that that review also
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
showed that deaf people uh have uh
 
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
challenges when masks are used and that
 
02:32:44.670 --> 02:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
people with certain medical conditions
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
you can see it in the summary they
 
02:32:49.150 --> 02:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
require some exceptions and during the
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic we we knew that it was very
 
02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
difficult and often impossible to get
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
necessary medical exception that review
 
02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
also raised the question of mask H to
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
children and it's not in the summary uh
 
02:33:09.870 --> 02:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh what was the finding uh second point
 
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
out of three points I need to make about
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
it uh is uh this review raised some
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
controversy around uh fully fitted patus
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
versus close close masks and uh you can
 
02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
see it on the page five of the uh hand
 
02:33:32.269 --> 02:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
out that uh there was a revision that
 
02:33:35.230 --> 02:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
need to be made because uh there was
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
misunder understanding of what this
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
review uh did and they even used a
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
picture of a mask that according to that
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
review was not effective so they had to
 
02:33:48.990 --> 02:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
change the picture used for that review
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh a misunderstanding of what that
 
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
review actually says and a certain point
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
to what representative Merchant uh uh
 
02:34:04.349 --> 02:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
stressed that masks are creating social
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
cultural change even regardless
 
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
effective they are or not and I agree
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
with this point I just don't agree with
 
02:34:17.070 --> 02:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
seeing it as necessarily positive things
 
02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
so uh when representative Merchant says
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
that uh when everyone forced to wear
 
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
masks it means that virus is serious
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yes it's true but it's
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
creating pressure it creating stress it
 
02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
creating fear when there's a pressure we
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
see the situation when medical exe
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions that need to be uh granted
 
02:34:44.910 --> 02:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
are not granted uh we we see that
 
02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
patients have worse outcome and it's uh
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
pretty uh
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
established scientific knowledge that
 
02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:55.429 align:start position:0%
established scientific knowledge that
stress

02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
stress
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
actually vers outcome during the illness
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
so if it's not necessary it can have ver
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
population outcome and finally it's uh
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
we have separation of state and religion
 
02:35:15.910 --> 02:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
for reason we we shouldn't be just uh
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
based on beliefs we believe that it's a
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
deadly disease and we are all going to
 
02:35:23.950 --> 02:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
die like if facts are contradicting it
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be forcing people to wear
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
masks just to because it's our belief
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matches the fact and actual
 
02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh death rate for example among children
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh so those are my point regardless uh
 
02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh papers that were distributed thank
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%

02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I I would like
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
to thank representative paulol and I
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
would I would essentially second those
 
02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
remarks in that I think um when the
 
02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
state decides to make um certainly
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
mandates perhaps even recommendations
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
but certainly mandates that are of a
 
02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:14.670 align:start position:0%
but certainly mandates that are of a
symbolic

02:36:14.670 --> 02:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
symbolic
 
02:36:18.910 --> 02:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
nature in order to um in order to steer
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
people and any sort of particular
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
direction I believe that is
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a violation of the freedom
 
02:36:27.269 --> 02:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
of conscience and it really gets it
 
02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
Mighty close if not over the line of
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
violating the establishment of religion
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
clause of the First Amendment thank you
 
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
