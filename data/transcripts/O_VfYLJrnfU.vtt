going through some of the details of our

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
in preparation for today we were
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
reflecting upon the questions that we
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
received at our last session
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
and so there's a couple of items that we
 
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
thought warranted further discussion
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
and so marie mullen our director of
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
finance has put together a presentation
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
she's going to pull it up on the screen
 
00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.510 align:start position:0%
she's going to pull it up on the screen
and

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
as with our last presentation both
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
myself as commissioner um
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
and then chris wojcik's deputy
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner will be presenting
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
and marie will do sort of a deeper dive
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
the details of our accounting and bill
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
cass our assistant commissioner is here
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you might
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
have when it comes to projects or the
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
work that we perform
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
so the first item that we wanted to
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
focus on is the highway fund
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
waterfall just to make sure that
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
especially for any new members
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
you understand which funds are
 
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.110 align:start position:0%
you understand which funds are
restricted

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
and which ones are unrestricted and
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
available for
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
use in the budget and um while this
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
chart on the screen is rather busy
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to focus um just on the
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
bolded headings and marie's going to
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
walk you through the waterfall i think
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative lin this will help you
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
understand why as we discussed at the
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
last meeting
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
we have to continue to work on design
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
and construction projects
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
even at times when our operations are
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
stretched very thin
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's all to do with how accounts are
 
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.629 align:start position:0%
it's all to do with how accounts are
restricted

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
and intended for a certain purpose um so
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
with that i'll turn it over to marie
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
good morning let me make sure i'm
 
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.589 align:start position:0%
good morning let me make sure i'm
unmuted

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
unmuted
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
i am unmuted okay good morning everyone
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for having us
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
back again
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
um this first slide is it's a history of
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
the road toll and motor vehicle fees
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
this is something as the commissioner
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
said we like to
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
present so that folks can understand
 
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:52.390 align:start position:0%
present so that folks can understand
first

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
the road toll the gas tax the 22.2 cents
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
that the state collects
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
how that gets broken down and and where
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
that goes
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
each year so
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
first of all um by law 12
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the gross revenue that comes in from
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
the road toll
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
goes out to block grant aid it gets
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
distributed to
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
municipalities throughout the state
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing off the top so
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's approximately 2.7 cents of the
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
22.2 cents
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh then in law or rsa 239
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
is the betterment law where 88
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
of 3 cents goes to betterment
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
so it's that 12
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
comes off the top for block grant aid so
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's why you can see it's
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
2.6 cents and not 3 cents because the
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
block grant aid comes out of the top of
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.6 cents is restricted
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes to the department of
 
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.430 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes to the department of
transportation

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
for betterment that is used for paving
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh bridge projects various repairs
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's primarily used for paving and
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
culvert work um that we
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
that we do need to need to maintain and
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
repair on our roads
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
this funding goes towards um
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
a majority of our um non-fed eligible
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
roads so
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds are not able to be used
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
for maintenance and repair so
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
these funds are needed for
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
those non-federal eligible roads and
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
also for the maintenance and repairs on
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
our roads
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
because federal funds can only be used
 
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
because federal funds can only be used
for

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
more permanent repairs and that type of
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
they don't allow us to use it on
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance so this betterment funding
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
is extremely important to maintain
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
the you know our roads and bridges in
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
sp 367 um many of you
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
may be aware back in 2014 that was the
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
bill number
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
where 4.2 increase in the road toll
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
was passed through the legislature and
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
the governor at that time
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
again you see 3.7 cents here that's
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
because 12 percent comes off the top
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
and is part of this block grant aid here
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
so 3.7 of that
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
goes to sb 367 and a later slide will
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
show you
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
how the waterfall of sb 367 and how
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
those funds get distributed in what
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're being used
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
for so we will talk about that later on
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the presentation
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the remainder the 13.2
 
00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the remainder the 13.2
cents

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.110 align:start position:0%
cents
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
cents
[Music]

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
ends up being the the unrestricted
 
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.670 align:start position:0%
ends up being the the unrestricted
revenue

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
that goes towards operations for the
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
for dot and other agencies that draw on
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
including cost of collections for the
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
road toll
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
then you have the motor vehicle fees
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
that are collected by the department of
 
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
that are collected by the department of
safety

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
um again the 12 block grant comes off of
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
the top of those
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
um that gross and so then 88
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
is used for um again
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the is the unrestricted piece
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
that gets used for operations for dot
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
department of safety again and the other
 
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.269 align:start position:0%
department of safety again and the other
agencies

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
so um so we like to show you know
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
in this history how that breakdown um
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
of those total revenues that come in
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
what portion
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
is going directly back to the
 
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
is going directly back to the
municipalities

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
is being used by safety and other
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
agencies and
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
by dot so you can see over time
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
um you know these percentages have
 
00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:49.110 align:start position:0%
um you know these percentages have
shifted

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
shifted
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
um you know at one point dot was at 65
 
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
um you know at one point dot was at 65
percent

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
now we're at like 58 59 percent
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
um and some of these others have
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
increased block grant is now up to 14
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
going out to the municipalities um
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if there's any questions
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
on this but we just
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
you know wanted to show where all where
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
the road toll and these
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
unrestricted motor vote motor vehicle
 
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
unrestricted motor vote motor vehicle
fees

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
i i do have a question um
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
one over on your last column there that
 
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.590 align:start position:0%
one over on your last column there that
says

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh for nhdot
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
percent for nhd dot um
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
is that the decline because of the
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
change we made
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
in costa collections or
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
is it some other area that is
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
um causing the drop um i think over time
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's been the the way that the
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's been determined how the but how the
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
budget works um
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
um i believe the department of state
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
safety state police and others
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know at one point when the general
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
fund was in
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
um poorer condition than the highway
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
fund was
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
there you know there were highway funds
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
moved over to support state police in
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
and some of that has now come back the
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
other way as you can see it
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
at one point it was dot was about 50
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
um back in 2012 uh dot was about 50
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
percent of that
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's come back up i think that you know
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
more general funds have been put into
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
the state police and that's been kind of
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
reversed a little bit
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
but i think that's where some of it was
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of collections has always
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
come out of
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
the highway fund um so
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
it it back in like 2012 or 2014 it was
 
00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:52.870 align:start position:0%
it it back in like 2012 or 2014 it was
just

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
the revenue was just called something
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
else but it's always come out of the
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative murray you
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much i suspect i'm
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to already know this but i'll
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
be darned if i can dredge it up this
 
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.509 align:start position:0%
be darned if i can dredge it up this
morning

00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
where are these percentages uh where who
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
determines these percentage
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
divisions this
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
these are based on actual expenditures
 
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
these are based on actual expenditures
at

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
for those years but those are those are
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
determined based on the budget and how
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
the budget is
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
appropriated at that time at that year
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
during the biennium
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
so it's dependent upon you know the
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
legislature the governor at the time and
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
how they've
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
determined those funds should be used
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
there is an
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
rsa um rsa 6
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
that requires a certain percentage
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
be provided to dot and other agencies
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
so that rsa actually i believe it's rsa
 
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.069 align:start position:0%
so that rsa actually i believe it's rsa
99

00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
99
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
requires that at least 74 percent
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
be contributed to the department of
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.670 align:start position:0%
be contributed to the department of
transportation

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the department of safety can have no
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
more than 26 percent and other
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
agencies can have no more than one
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
percent so
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
there is something in law that requires
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
and when you're looking at dot
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
percentages um
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
because the block grant aid goes through
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
those two percentages get added together
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
for that rsa
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
so as marie explained it's like
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
currently in statute
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
it says that no more than 26 can go to
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
safety but i think we touched on this
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
last time
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
as we finalize the budget that's one of
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
the checks that we always do
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and as you can see in the past at times
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
they've suspended that law and changed
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
the percentages
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
so madam chair is that something that
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
we'll be discussing or no
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely okay thank you
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sure mickey's usually right on
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
top of that so i'm sure
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
mickey is probably already been looking
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
are there any uh further questions
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh are you i have one more are you
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
getting any
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
feedback from the towns about the fact
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
that the block grants are going to go
 
00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:17.509 align:start position:0%
that the block grants are going to go
down

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
this year because just the money has not
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we've had um some concern
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
about that commissioner i don't know if
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
more i don't get direct calls on that
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
type of thing but i do think
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
i think last year because the block
 
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.110 align:start position:0%
i think last year because the block
grant

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
allocations that are made to the
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities are based on the prior
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
year's revenues
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
when we um awarded the dollars
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
um during the pandemic it was based on
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
the prior year's revenues they didn't
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
see a reduction
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
but certainly at this point going
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
forward based on where revenues are
 
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.990 align:start position:0%
forward based on where revenues are
trending

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
trending
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
there would be concern that's one of the
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
reasons that we're advocating at the
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
for further relief dollars or stimulus
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
dollars for transportation purposes
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
because then we could hopefully
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um try and restore some of this funding
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
and the minimum get back to
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
what we have been able to spend in the
 
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.549 align:start position:0%
what we have been able to spend in the
past

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
heath you have a question oh thank you
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
madam chair i did not realize
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
that you had that um drag
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
so do you have to appropriate more
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um then really you have are able to
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
based on um what's happened
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
with uh people just not driving and your
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
revenues are not coming in the way you
 
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.789 align:start position:0%
revenues are not coming in the way you
expect

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is will this further
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
put you into more deficit
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
because of those block grants that have
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
to go to municipalities
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
no representative um because it's 12 of
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
the revenues that we collect
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
if the revenues go down then we
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
allocate less than was budgeted okay i
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
think what's happened in the past is
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
when revenues trend above projection we
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
then go to fiscal
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
to be given the authority to distribute
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
additional money to make sure the cities
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
mary the the problem is that the 12
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
this year is going to be quite a bit
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
less than what it
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
has been in the past um
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it will be the same for uh next year
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
since uh uh commissioner indicated that
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
it was based on prior year
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
for uh distribution so i expect
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
we the representatives will be um
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
hearing from our cities and towns
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
about you know how could you nasty folks
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
our grants but you know we just need to
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
explain to them
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
that it's based on revenue
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
and maybe they should drive a little
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
what we did discuss at the end of the
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
last legislative session
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
was if we as dot were to receive
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
stimulus funding or through
 
00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.390 align:start position:0%
stimulus funding or through
reauthorization

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
reauthorization
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
be given dollars where we had more
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility we explained that
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
we are reliant on the betterment and the
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
to both support the municipalities as
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
well as to do work on certain
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
types of roadway primarily what we call
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
tier three and four roads that aren't
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funding
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
but if there was additional federal
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
dollars provided with more flexibility
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
and where we could use them
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
then certainly as part of the budget
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
process if dot was receiving more direct
 
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.190 align:start position:0%
process if dot was receiving more direct
funding

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
through federal sources then we could
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
adjust the block grant percentage maybe
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
for the upcoming budget
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
but right now there's no guarantees of
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
federal funding that's certainly
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
something that we
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
um you know shouldn't be
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
until we understand what dollars might
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
be available um
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
but maybe in hb2 there would be an
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to change some of the
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
percentages just for this biennium
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
if federal dollars materialize that
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
would help us out
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
so those are all things that we're
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
tracking closely and as we advocate
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
um both through our delegation and
 
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.950 align:start position:0%
um both through our delegation and
through

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
the associations that we're part of we
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
keep advocating that we need flexibility
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
we don't just want an increase in
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
federal funding for traditional
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
federal uses we need to be a little bit
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
more flexible
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we can continue to honor
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
our commitments to
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
so uh when you were in dc
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
advocating did you did you get any
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
positive response or were they just uh
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
typical uh senators that sat there and
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
looked at you well the senators were
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
primarily talking about re-authorization
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
and which would be the next federal
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
funding bill um
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
so we're expecting that there would be
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
limited flexibility
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
when they pass a new surface
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
transportation bill what we're hoping
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
for is
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
as soon as the relief discussions are
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
concluded and they start talking about
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure package that's meant
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
more for stimulus
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
then that's where we might be given the
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility um just as
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know the 41 million that we received
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
in relief dollars in december of 2020
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
um those dollars we have that latitude
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
to use them for
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance which is why
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget you see that
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
transfer reducing our draw on the
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
so it's the my testimony was more about
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
long-term funding and making sure that
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
we have sustainable sources of federal
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
revenue that we can count on
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
because that way as we do our 10-year
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
plan we have a better sense of
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
what size our program will be but then
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
we also are
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
advocating for this you know
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure stimulus
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
that would have more of a near-term
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
benefit and hopefully that's where they
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
build in the flexibility
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions okay
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
so last time when we came before you we
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
touched on
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
some of these items but we thought it
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
warranted revisiting
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
um how dollars have been
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
moving in and out of the highway fund to
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
help balance the budget in prior
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
biennium so with that marine do you want
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
to explain
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
what the charts on this slide show
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
yeah so on on this side slide you
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
probably remember last time we went
 
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.110 align:start position:0%
probably remember last time we went
through

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
um some of the um you know
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
revenue like the 30 dollar surcharge
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 2011
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
um that was put in place and then was
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
repealed that was to help
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
with the deficit at the time in the
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
there were some other one-time areas
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
such as the retro
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
turnpike toll credits as you know we
 
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.149 align:start position:0%
turnpike toll credits as you know we
match

00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
our federal program with toll credits so
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
at that time we had been using state
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
match on some projects and we were
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to retroactively go back
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
and collect the federal funds and return
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
the state funds
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
so we did that for that period of time
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we could and then of course there
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
was the i-95
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
sale of the bridge between maine and new
 
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.549 align:start position:0%
sale of the bridge between maine and new
hampshire

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the turnpike system and
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
the revenue from that transaction
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
was included in the budget originally
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to be a 20-year note
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to be paid over 20 years
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
by the turnpike system
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
but was advanced to help balance the
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
and as you can see it was paid off over
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
six years
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
um so at that time we had those
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
additional revenues
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i just want to point out that this
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
is the unrestricted revenue so
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're on that previous chart we had
 
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.750 align:start position:0%
we're on that previous chart we had
included

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
betterment and sb 367. these revenues do
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
not include that because those are
 
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.990 align:start position:0%
not include that because those are
restricted

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
funds so this just includes the
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
unrestricted portion
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then this um this is just um
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
something else that we had talked about
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't but we didn't actually have
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
the you know we i just verbally talked
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers and stuff there were some
 
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.669 align:start position:0%
the numbers and stuff there were some
other

00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
one-time sources that were
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
put into the highway fund to help
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
balance the highway fund
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we talked about the first three on
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
the previous slide
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 and 2017 we
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
also had 8.3 million each year
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
that was used from the sb
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
367 4.2 gas tax so prior to
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
dot entering the the loan
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
with um with the tiffy alone with the
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
we were we used a portion of that
 
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.350 align:start position:0%
we were we used a portion of that
revenue

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
to for the operating budget for dot
 
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.909 align:start position:0%
to for the operating budget for dot
d.o.t

00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
d.o.t
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
so that was included in here and and
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
once we went into that loan we were
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
unable to
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
use it for operations anymore because we
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
have other covenants on that loan
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
so that's why you'll see it for that
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
year in
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
2017 to balance the 2018-2019 budget
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
there was 13.9 million of general funds
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
put into the highway fund again in
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
2020 there was 4 million and
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
currently in this budget um there's 8.1
 
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.230 align:start position:0%
currently in this budget um there's 8.1
million

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
from the general fund and as you may
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
remember last time we discussed
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
that was um those were funds that were
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
um general funds that were provided to
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
for red list bridge repairs we were able
 
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:17.909 align:start position:0%
for red list bridge repairs we were able
to

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
identify federal funds on the the last
 
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.269 align:start position:0%
identify federal funds on the the last
bridge

00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
so we've lapsed so those funds have been
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
will be lapsed and will be transferred
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund to help balance the
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then again the federal relief funds
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
um from the end of december for the
 
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.510 align:start position:0%
um from the end of december for the
crrsaa

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
crrsaa
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
act a coronavirus relief act
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it that at that we
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
received 41 million dollars in relief
 
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.950 align:start position:0%
received 41 million dollars in relief
funds

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
that um for lost revenue that have been
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
has been incurred because of covid so
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
infused into the highway fund as well to
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
help balance the highway fund
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so all of these one-time sources have
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
been able you know have been used and
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
utilized in the past
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
to help balance the fund and balance the
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
the work that needs to be done for
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
department of transportation department
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
of safety
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
and the other agencies that draw on the
 
00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:17.190 align:start position:0%
and the other agencies that draw on the
fund

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
this is part of the reason that you see
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
that change in the percentage of highway
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
funds going to different
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
departments as well depending on how
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
these general fund dollars are budgeted
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
whether they go directly to an agency or
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
whether it's a transfer into the highway
 
00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:33.269 align:start position:0%
whether it's a transfer into the highway
fund

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason for the
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in addition to
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
um the costs of doing business
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
fluctuating over time and the
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
legislature choosing to budget dollars
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions before i
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
move on
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative murray has a
 
00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:52.789 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative murray has a
question

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just a little
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
hopeful thinking um you know
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
i see that big drop down to 2023
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
um any hope on the horizon
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
about what may change in 2023 with
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
so department of safety who collects the
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
revenue has been doing presentations for
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
on what we're anticipating for highway
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
fund revenue
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh throughout this next biennium but
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
then also we're starting conversations
 
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
then also we're starting conversations
around

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
what the future looks like before this
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
meeting began
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh the committee were having a
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
discussion around
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
how the real estate market is doing very
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
well in new hampshire and
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
how a lot of folks from out of state
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
have moved into new hampshire
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
and if those individuals can continue to
 
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:42.870 align:start position:0%
and if those individuals can continue to
telework

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
telework
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to see different
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
commuting patterns so that's
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
what our primary concern is and i think
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
we touched on this last time
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
but it's it's challenging for us in the
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
transportation profession at the moment
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
to anticipate how businesses are going
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
to react post pandemic
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
movements it's great as we talked about
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
last time for individuals
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
in that teleworking gives them more
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility and better work-life balance
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we talked about the
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
expansion of telehealth
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
um as well as online purchasing
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
and then also online higher education
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
and all of those factors will impact our
 
00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:21.830 align:start position:0%
and all of those factors will impact our
long-term

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
traffic patterns so that's why we're
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
starting conversations with chambers of
 
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.070 align:start position:0%
starting conversations with chambers of
commerce

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i actually am speaking at the
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
business industry association next week
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
determine how we can best work with
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
industry and
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
businesses to understand what their
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
work environment environments going to
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
be in the future and what options are
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to provide
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
i see no further questions so if you
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
we can go forward
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
so as marie mentioned earlier um we were
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
remiss last time that we did not include
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
this slide with the waterfall
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
for sb 367. and so in that pink chart
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
that you saw in the first slide we
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
talked about the overall
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
waterfall of all the um highway fund
 
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.870 align:start position:0%
waterfall of all the um highway fund
revenue

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
but this slide shows you specifically
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
what our commitments are
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
through senate bill 367. so marie do you
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
do the deep dive on this one yeah
 
00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:21.269 align:start position:0%
do the deep dive on this one yeah
absolutely

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
um so um sb 367
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
um increased the road toll by 4.2 cents
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
but dedicated it
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
to certain areas um
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
so the first area that by law that
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
based on this waterfall that comes out
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
of this is the block grant aid so 12
 
00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
of this is the block grant aid so 12
percent

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
is again is distributed to the cities
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
and towns directly
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
next as part of the law it is to cover
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
any debt service costs related to i-93
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
so um in the law it was agreed that 200
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
million could be
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
bonded or loan or or et cetera
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
we engaged in a tiffy alone with
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
the depa with the federal government um
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
and that tiffy alone
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
um what we were able to get the rural
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
interest rate so we had an all-in
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
interest cost of 1.09 percent on that
 
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.389 align:start position:0%
interest cost of 1.09 percent on that
loan

00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
loan
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
it was far cheaper than bonding or any
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
other financing mechanism
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
so we we entered into that loan so
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
the second requirement is interest in
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
principal payments
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
for that for that loan so you can see
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
the schedule here and what we you know
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
what we've done
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
is during the construction phase we are
 
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.430 align:start position:0%
is during the construction phase we are
paying

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
interest only on the project
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
um it it was just opened in december of
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
2020 to four lanes
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
um so we were able to defer um
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
and paying principal for four years
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
after completion of construction
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
and then upon that we need to start
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
paying principal
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2026. so you can see
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're paying interest only and during
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
those funds go to other places in the
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
waterfall so as part of the waterfall
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
state aid bridge so aid for municipal
 
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
state aid bridge so aid for municipal
bridges

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
get 6.8 million per year
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
and then as i had stated before that in
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
2016-17 there were a couple of areas
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
where we put it towards the operating
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.630 align:start position:0%
where we put it towards the operating
budget

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
but after the state aid bridge then the
 
00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:31.669 align:start position:0%
but after the state aid bridge then the
last

00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
area that the the funds would flow to
 
00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
area that the the funds would flow to
are

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
the betterment program so
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
we have pledged as part of the tiffy
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
alone that we will
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
do rural paving and bridge repairs
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
and that by cove by having that covenant
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
and making that
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
dedication to doing rural paving and
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
bridge repairs that's how we were able
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
that low interest rate we were able to
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
get the rural interest rate
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
so um as you can see um you know we have
 
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.149 align:start position:0%
so um as you can see um you know we have
about

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
20 to 23 million dollars depending on
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
the revenue and what's left over as it
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
as it flows down to the betterment that
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
we've been putting into
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
paving each year and uh redless bridges
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
um so for the great
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
is this in addition to
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
the um money from the road toll
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
or the the dollar value that you showed
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
us before
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
for betterment is it that dollar value
 
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.509 align:start position:0%
for betterment is it that dollar value
plus

00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
plus
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
this for betterment yes that's correct
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
betterment is a
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
separate amount it's three cents out of
 
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.430 align:start position:0%
separate amount it's three cents out of
that

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
out of that full 22.2 cents it's a
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
separate three cents and this
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
four on top of that so perhaps marie do
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
you want to go back to the first slide
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
yep so this clearly shows that the the
 
00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:06.230 align:start position:0%
yep so this clearly shows that the the
gross

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
gross
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
road toll is 22.2 cents
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
so there's 2.6 going to betterment
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
then there's 3.7 of the 4.2 cents
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
because the 12
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
comes off the top goes to
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
um this sb 367 waterfall
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
and then what marie has shown you is the
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
deeper dive on how those dollars get
 
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
deeper dive on how those dollars get
distributed

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's it's additive
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
yes so the betterment is additive to
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
this yep
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much the one thing i
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
highlight is for the purposes of this
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
budget you know we're very confident
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
that revenues will continue
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
to sustain providing a full 6.8 million
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
to municipal bridges through the
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
state aid bridge program that's because
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're still paying the
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
interest only on the tifio loan um
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
the numbers that we are showing you for
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
2026 and beyond in terms of revenue
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
projections are very
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
preliminary um next year as we work on
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan and we have more
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
certainty around you know how traffic
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
patterns are
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
changing a post pandemic we'll be
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
working to refine these numbers
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
um but you can see that we're now
 
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.870 align:start position:0%
um but you can see that we're now
previously

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
um we were forecasting a larger
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
amount of revenue in those out years
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
which would have allowed us to support
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
the state a bridge program at 6.8
 
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
the state a bridge program at 6.8
million

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
annually now we're showing that if the
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
revenues decline
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
as one of our models indicates the
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
amount of funding available for city and
 
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:46.870 align:start position:0%
amount of funding available for city and
town

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
bridge work will be impacted as well
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not something to worry about for
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
this budget like i said because we're
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
still paying
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
interest only we have the full 6.8
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
million to make
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we follow through in our
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
commitments and can advance the projects
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
that are currently programmed
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
but certainly as we look to the 10-year
 
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.310 align:start position:0%
but certainly as we look to the 10-year
plan

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
and talk about the state a bridge
 
00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:11.750 align:start position:0%
and talk about the state a bridge
program

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
will be discussing this waterfall in
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
more detail
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
a conversation we'll have with your
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the public works and
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
highways committee
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
rather than division two finance
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
did i see one of one of the participants
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
with their hands
 
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
with their hands
raised

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh chris yeah you want to make one
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
one more additional comment on the
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
future revenue
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
as part of um as part of an exercise to
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
look at the road usage fee
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
we hired a consultant and it's noted
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
down here came to systematics
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the footnote one to look at the
 
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
in the footnote one to look at the
long-term

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
impact of fuel efficient vehicles on
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund revenue so as part of their
 
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.349 align:start position:0%
highway fund revenue so as part of their
effort

00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
they took a hard look and they had a
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
range of options
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
and this represents kind of the middle
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
middle of the
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
um you know in between the high and low
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
impact that they identified so it shows
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
about a percent reduction
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
per year in revenue
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
because of the increase in
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
fuel-efficient vehicles so
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
um it's certainly it's certainly a
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
projection um
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
but it comes from that study and comes
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
from you know their expertise in that
 
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.829 align:start position:0%
from you know their expertise in that
area

00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to point that out for the
 
00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
i just want to point that out for the
committee

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you that's uh that is a
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good point so those are the two
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
industry trends we're going to be
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
watching both
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
you know the greening of the fleet and
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
the increase in fuel efficiency but then
 
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.710 align:start position:0%
the increase in fuel efficiency but then
also

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the long-term um commuter patterns as
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
well so those two factors will
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
impact our revenue forecasts when we
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
look at a longer horizon
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
and and then in the future horizon as
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
well in 2035 that's when
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
the the rsa sunsets when the 4.2 set sun
 
00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:14.550 align:start position:0%
the the rsa sunsets when the 4.2 set sun
sets

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
sets
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it was a 20-year period or when the
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
the bonds were paid off so
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is that 20 20 35 is that 20 year
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
period so in 2035
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
currently the revenue sun sets and
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
there um that goes away for any
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
betterment or
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
any other road work and block grenade as
 
00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
any other road work and block grenade as
well

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions on the tiffia i
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
doubt that any of us will be
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay marie thank you uh if you want to
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
go oh tom you have a question
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh yes thank you madam chair so i
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to uh go back to um
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
how this how this program got the the
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
nickname of waterfall and i think that
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
what i remember was that um here in here
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
2025 when we start stop when we have to
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
stop repaying the principal
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
and then the uh the money for paving and
 
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.829 align:start position:0%
and then the uh the money for paving and
bridge

00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
bridge work just falls right off
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
am i was that correct with that yeah
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
that is our concern representative
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
um as chair umberger indicated
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
our betterment program is much larger
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
today because we have
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
the betterment dollars that are
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
restricted and then we add to them
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
with the tiffia pledged uh bridge repair
 
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.950 align:start position:0%
with the tiffia pledged uh bridge repair
dollars

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so we're spending significantly more
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
but yes come 2026
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
um as we start paying the principal on
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
the tiffy alone
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
then our capacity to do work um through
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
the betterment program
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
is basically half um depending on how
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections trend
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we're fortunate
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
because of sb 367 and then the further
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
value that the tiffy alone provided
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing some of the best
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
pavement condition we've been able to do
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
an additional 23 redless bridges
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
with this revenue and but we are
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about what will happen to
 
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.430 align:start position:0%
concerned about what will happen to
condition

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
when uh first we start paying the
 
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.710 align:start position:0%
when uh first we start paying the
principal

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
principal
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
um but then the other concern for the
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities is the fact that the
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
state a bridge program um
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
you know may shrink in size over time
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
with sunset in 2035 and that's the only
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
support that we provide to cities and
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
towns directly for their bridge projects
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner representative
 
00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:49.829 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner representative
murray

00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
murray
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you this is an aside um is anyone
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
else hearing
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
chatter um like another conversation
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
someone's listening to another
 
00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:56.870 align:start position:0%
someone's listening to another
conversation

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit distracting
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
is anyone else hearing that or is it
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
just me yes i hear that
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think perhaps mike
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
yeah perhaps it's representative petrie
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's not me my mic's open but there's
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's no chatter here
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
oh there's i hear another conversation
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
going on so i was wondering if we can
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
all mute anyway thank you sorry to
 
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.670 align:start position:0%
all mute anyway thank you sorry to
interrupt

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
interrupt
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
no problem um
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
so at this point we wanted to circle
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
back to some of our additional needs
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
that were not funded
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
um last time we spent some
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
of our session together talking in
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
detail about the fleet and in a few
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
moments um chris is going to
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
once again revisit some of those numbers
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you have the complete
 
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you have the complete
picture

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
picture
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
um so i'm going to skip over the first
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
two items but um
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned last time during the
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
last budget we were very
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
grateful that there was additional
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
funding provided for us to do some
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance work
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of that work did not
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
proceed once um
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
covert 19 started to impact revenues
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
and you know we were trying to lapse as
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
much uh funding as possible
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
and so we are still concerned that we
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
should be spending more
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
on important items such as the repair
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of guardrail
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
and this of course is very important
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
from a safety perspective
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
and um as well as things like
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
bridge washing we currently don't have
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
adequate funding to wash all of our
 
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.470 align:start position:0%
adequate funding to wash all of our
bridges

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
annually after the winter season to get
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
all the salt off them
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
and we certainly would like to have a
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
more robust program
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
and it's all about keeping the
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in a good state of repair
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
because that's the most cost effective
 
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
because that's the most cost effective
way

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
to manage those assets and then there's
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
several other items that
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
have been discussed in previous biennium
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
and it's disappointing that we haven't
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
been able to move forward
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
um telematic devices and equipment and
 
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.630 align:start position:0%
um telematic devices and equipment and
software

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
to help us better manage our fleet um
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's one of the items that we've put
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
forward several times
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
the other thing is as we prepare for
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
both new and emerging technologies and
 
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.109 align:start position:0%
both new and emerging technologies and
continue

00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
to enhance our traffic management
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
and we have been deploying a lot of its
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
devices that's intelligent
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
transportation devices
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
and um you'll see that we have
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
both cameras out on the highway as well
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
as some of those dynamic
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
message signs that help us communicate
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
reduce speed limits as an example during
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
snow events
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
and while we've been using federal funds
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
to install a number of those devices or
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds it was part of major
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
capital projects
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
some of that equipment does need
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
further repair and maintenance and so
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's another exposure that we have
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
and then graffiti removal i know this
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
committee during the last budget talked
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
a lot about
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
um some of the uh aesthetics
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
um and the uh
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
the impression that we want to give
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
visitors to our state and so
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know when we are
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
struggling to
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
do the essential um routine maintenance
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
and ensure that we are
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
patching potholes keeping the highway
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
safe the things that don't get done as
 
00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.230 align:start position:0%
safe the things that don't get done as
frequently

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
are things like graffiti removal um and
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
we don't mow as frequently and such
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
items like that because they're
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly important in terms of the
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
character of our state
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
but you know we have to favor other work
 
00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:48.870 align:start position:0%
but you know we have to favor other work
that

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
supports safety and ensures that we can
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
keep the system running
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so one of the other things that we
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
had previously
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
asked for it and had been supported was
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
graffiti removal
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
which is very costly especially in some
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the more urban areas
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
where it's a challenge to keep up
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
and you know it's both graffiti on our
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
bridge abutments
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
as well as a number of our sound walls
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
and noise barriers that we have along
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
the highway
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
and then the last item is something
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
we've talked about again for several
 
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.190 align:start position:0%
we've talked about again for several
biennium

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
um the conway bypass project
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i believe uh cherumburger bill cass
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
as you requested did reach out and you
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
had a conversation about this project
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
but the conway bypass was a 10-year plan
 
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:37.750 align:start position:0%
but the conway bypass was a 10-year plan
project

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
that was advanced in design and
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
construction and but the traffic volumes
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
never really grew as expected
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
and so it was determined that given our
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
limited federal funding
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't prudent to move forward and
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
construct that project as planned
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
so we have to pay back the federal
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
government um marie explained this at
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
our last session
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
but there's what's known as the 10 20
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
year rule which basically gives you time
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
frames when you have to move
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
from one phase to the next as you
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
advance the federal project
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
and um we did not move into construction
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
within the 20-year window
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have to pay back um
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
any of the federal
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
dollars that were used for this
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
particular project
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
um so we have been gradually going to
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal and moving some money around to
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
be able to pay back
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
um on this project but we're still a
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
little short
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
and so um our additional need was for
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
two million per year
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the payback and um
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
we continue to work with federal highway
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
to understand the timing of that
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh and as well as um
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
the corridor has officially been
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
dissolved and so that allows us
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
to um surplus some of the property and
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
sell it off to come up with these
 
00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.349 align:start position:0%
sell it off to come up with these
proceeds

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
proceeds
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so we're working on that effort as
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
well there's a desire to maintain
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
a corridor for recreational use and rail
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
trail use
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so we are establishing that layout
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
so that we can then surplus the
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
additional parcels that are no longer
 
00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.630 align:start position:0%
additional parcels that are no longer
needed

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
um now all of this sounds bad you've got
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
to pay back the federal government
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
while we have to make a cash payback
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
with state funds
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
it does give us further authority to do
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
more construction work
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
so you pay it back with state dollars to
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
then have more authority and grow your
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
again so this is just something that we
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
keep bringing up
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
fortunately federal highway has not
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
directly asked for immediate payback um
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
so we've been able to defer this
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
conversation in the past but eventually
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be at a point where um
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to request that we
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
make the payback as required by law and
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
so these were our additional needs
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's any questions on
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
these um but by far
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
and the item that we're the most
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the fleet
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're going to spend some
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
more time today digging into the
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
the needs on that side representative
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
petry you have a question
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair uh that conway
 
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.630 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair uh that conway
bypass

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
bypass
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
has a is there um a system to uh
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
um request a waiver
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
um so the law requires uh the payback
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
um there is really no waiver process
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
the only latitude that we feel that
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
usdot would have
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
is to um give us a longer period over
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
which to pay back the funds
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
um but even that is not um something
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the statute
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
anticipates and so that's why we've been
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
working with them for so many years on
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
but if in this case usdot is just
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
following what's in law
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions out there
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay let us proceed if we could
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm so at this point i'll turn it over
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
to chris and um he'll walk you through
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
the fleet statistics again
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
so good morning um so this this is a
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
slide that
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
we showed last last time and
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to just go through and maybe
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
highlight a few things
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
so this is a summary that is put
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
together by a mechanical services bureau
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
each year you know so for fiscal year 21
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
as of the start of fiscal year 21 so
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
july 1
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
2020. i just want people to understand
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's a snapshot at that time that shows
 
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.190 align:start position:0%
it's a snapshot at that time that shows
um

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
what vehicles are in essence
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
at that point in time exceeding the
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
fleet parameters
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
during that time also we have vehicles
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
on order
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
that you know will replace some of those
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles that have
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
exceeded the parameters um but they're
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
not really they're not
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
they haven't been put in service so
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're not really reflected in this
 
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.190 align:start position:0%
they're not really reflected in this
chart

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
so as i noted last week we have 1258
 
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.630 align:start position:0%
so as i noted last week we have 1258
units

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
units
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
at that time that snapshot revealed that
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
277 or 22
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
exceeded the vehicle um the parameters
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
for example for a plow truck um it's 12
 
00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:23.109 align:start position:0%
for example for a plow truck um it's 12
years

00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe 250 000 miles
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of our standard that we
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
use for those vehicles
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
um if it reaches 12 years or 250 000
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
miles it will show up
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
as exceeding the parameters now the
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle may still be useful uh being
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
repaired but as
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
you can expect with older vehicles the
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
repairs tend to get much more expensive
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
and there's certainly a
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
a cost benefit there for you know
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
keeping vehicles too long
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
is a problem so each one of these
 
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.109 align:start position:0%
is a problem so each one of these
categories

00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
extra heavy duty heavy duty so this
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
extra heavy duty there are 10 wheelers
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
heavy duty six wheelers you know and so
 
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:04.630 align:start position:0%
heavy duty six wheelers you know and so
on

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
um as we as we took that snapshot
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
so um column g
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
shows a percentage of fleet exceeding
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
parameters in each
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
in each category and then column j
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
shows what the current replacement value
 
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.630 align:start position:0%
shows what the current replacement value
is

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
for those units um in today's dollars
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
i want to go down to um the subtotal of
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
all that
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
so to replace all that those units is 33
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
or we have identified that we need
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
8.9 million dollars of funding annually
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to replace the units so it's
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
sustainable so for example
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
the fleet is about is valued
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
its replacement value is 102 million um
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
just rough numbers if each vehicle lasts
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
about 10 to 12 years
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
you would need about 9 million dollars a
 
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.630 align:start position:0%
you would need about 9 million dollars a
year

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to replace vehicles as they
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
reach their
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
their uh threshold their their parameter
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
i do also want to point out um
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the first note there that the
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
acquisition cost
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
that was used to pay all those current
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles was 73.7 million
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
and now in order to replace all those
 
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.750 align:start position:0%
and now in order to replace all those
vehicles

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
um it's 102 million so as you can
 
00:52:27.839 --> 00:52:28.870 align:start position:0%
um it's 102 million so as you can
imagine

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
some of those older vehicles were less
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
expensive than they are today to replace
 
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:37.589 align:start position:0%
expensive than they are today to replace
um

00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
when that snapshot was taken we still
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
had roughly we still had with fiscal
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
year 20 acquisitions
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
were on order and being put in service
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
and we also had fiscal year 21
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
acquisition so that's where the 16
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
number comes in those were planned um
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
acquisitions monies that were encumbered
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
in vehicles in certain stages of being
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
built and put in service but we're not
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
yet in service
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
as of and i believe this was i say july
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
1st but this was revised november 16th
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
of 2020 so that left this kind of
 
00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:11.750 align:start position:0%
of 2020 so that left this kind of
backlog

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
backlog
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we call of 16.7 million dollars
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i noted last last time that because
 
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:19.510 align:start position:0%
and i noted last last time that because
of

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
covid and the impact on revenue
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
we were asked to only expend
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
essential purchases so on the next slide
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'll show
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
that in fiscal year 20 we lapped some of
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
the equipment budget
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
and 21 at that point we were prepared
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
we were propos well i guess we were
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
envisioning that we would need to lapse
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
4 million
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year 20 funds to
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
to reach our revised lapse target that
 
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.630 align:start position:0%
to reach our revised lapse target that
was

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
put forth to us since that time
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
we have taken a harder look at
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
different areas of the budget and we're
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
meet our laps target without touching
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
the equipment so
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
i guess bottom line here we are able to
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
fully expend
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 21 budget which would
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
increase that
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
16 million by 4 million to 20 million so
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
in essence the total would be reduced by
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
4 million down to 12.
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
i just want to point that out um
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on this slide
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
before i move to the next slide
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i have a question if i could
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh i see joe uh representative petrie
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
you have a question i'll let you go
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
first please
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
ah thank you madam chair uh on those uh
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
two wheel drive trucks uh we i asked the
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
same question to safety because the
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
state troopers used a
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
all-wheel drive vehicle and they cited
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
yes we have um we have our
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
um mechanical services bureau i think
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
last time i noted that there was an
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
additional cost of
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
several thousand dollars if we moved
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
forward with the um
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
with from two wheel to four wheel drive
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
trucks and
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
um that would have a considerable impact
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know over 300 you know light uh
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
light duty trucks that a two wheel drive
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
that potentially if you convert it all
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
to four-wheel drive
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
would have um you know over a million
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
dollar impact
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know so they're evaluating that um
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
we are you know there are benefits
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
certainly to
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
having a four-wheel drive vehicle um
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
certainly if
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
the snow is fairly deep you pull off to
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
the shoulder it's unplowed
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
um you know you hate to have our
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles get stuck in the snow because
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have that extra traction
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we're evaluating it but we need to
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
evaluate it as a whole
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
and what the impacts are on the overall
 
00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.390 align:start position:0%
and what the impacts are on the overall
budget

00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
um you know do we spend more money in
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
that area at the expense of letting
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
other vehicles
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know go to um you know
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
be become more deficient and not be able
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
to be replaced so
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's something that we are evaluating
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
it but we're evaluating it
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
as its impact on the entire fleet
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
not just individual
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
locations and certainly safety
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
is one area that we're going to take a
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
look at but
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
as i noted previously now and i'll talk
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more on the next slide
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
when monies get tight in the highway
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
fund one of the first things that get
 
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.349 align:start position:0%
fund one of the first things that get
that

00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
is looked at to get cut is equipment
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
rather than rather than laying off
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
people or
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know other priority needs
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
um equipment is still a priority but
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
again historically it's been one of the
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
first areas that
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
um is looked at to be able to be cut to
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
to tighten um you know the belt on
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures so
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
um it's something that we'll look at
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
holistically but um you know right now
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're not prepared as a department to
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
devote extra funds
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
to that area um at the expense of
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know the backlog follow up
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh yes please go ahead uh right uh well
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
if you go down to the local uh
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
truck shop here on new dealership you uh
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
you find it's pretty hard to find a
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
two-wheel drive vehicle in new hampshire
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
you have to order special and that's
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
that's one issue and i will say that as
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
i travel around the state i notice that
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
your vehicle is in excellent shape you
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
do a good job at that
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
i uh i do have a question um
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the 2021 budget cycle
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
were did all of this come from
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
the highway fund or was some of this
 
00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:04.549 align:start position:0%
the highway fund or was some of this
from

00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
so the plan 20 and 21 acquisitions were
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
all either from the operating budget
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
or the capital budget um
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps if we go to the next slide that
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
will become clearer chris do you want to
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
right but to answer her question
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of that it's all highway
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
funds so even the debt service
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
if we capitalized it would be coming
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
from the highway fund
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay well i was because i know in the
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
past we've given money out of the
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
general fund to
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
help with this not a lot but i just
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
know where it was coming from so
 
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.069 align:start position:0%
know where it was coming from so
basically

00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
this 8 million eight million dollars
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
would generally come out of the highway
 
00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:56.630 align:start position:0%
would generally come out of the highway
fund

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct i think on the next
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
slide it'll become evident
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
um we also had access to some of the vw
 
00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:04.069 align:start position:0%
um we also had access to some of the vw
settlement

00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
funds and we also have used dira which
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
is another program
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
but yes going forward this would all be
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
general funded
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
sorry highway funded not general funded
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
of course if there were general funds
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
available i'm sure
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
they could be utilized to purchase
 
00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.589 align:start position:0%
they could be utilized to purchase
equipment

00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
you thank marie or if there was you know
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
relief dollars or stimulus funds that
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
had latitude to be used
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's what we said last time
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
equipment's our number one priority when
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
so this provides kind of a 20 year look
 
00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:43.030 align:start position:0%
so this provides kind of a 20 year look
back

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
on equipment appropriation
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
and you know it's kind of history so
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at this chart in fiscal year
 
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:52.710 align:start position:0%
if you look at this chart in fiscal year
20

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me fiscal year 2000 um to
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
probably about 2003 that first
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
those first two bienniums um
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
the class 20 appropriations for
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
equipment you know we
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
ranged from roughly five million to
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
seven million um at that time when you
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
looked at probably the value of our
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh fleet um you could you could argue
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
that that was sufficient budget annually
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
to have a sustainable um sustainable
 
01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:22.710 align:start position:0%
to have a sustainable um sustainable
approach

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
and replace vehicles that needed to be
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
replaced um
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then beginning in 2004 um
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
and on you know in particular it got
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
exacerbated um in 2010 and beyond
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
equipment was looked at um an area that
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
reduced um because the
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
there were some struggles in the highway
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
fund there was a mandated freeze
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
um in 2004 by governor benson which
 
01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:49.829 align:start position:0%
um in 2004 by governor benson which
basically

01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
just um zeroed out our equipment budget
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
in that year um then there were other in
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
2008 and nine
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
there were internal lapses because the
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
highway fund was uh facing a deficit
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
so again equipment was cut uh by those
 
01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.190 align:start position:0%
so again equipment was cut uh by those
values

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
values
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
in those two years um and then this past
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
decade i just want to point
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
out um we take out if you if you take
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
out fiscal year 20 and 21 where we
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
really fought in the last biennium and
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know i thank you know the
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislature for you know fully funding
 
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.910 align:start position:0%
legislature for you know fully funding
equipment

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
um in our operating budget in the last
 
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.270 align:start position:0%
um in our operating budget in the last
biennium

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
but prior to that um the equipment
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
budget ranged from 2 million
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
to roughly 2.6 million in 2012
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
on average of 2.4 million a year so
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
um what happened was we should have been
 
01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.950 align:start position:0%
um what happened was we should have been
spending

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
spending
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know six to eight million a year and
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
we were only spending two million a year
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's why the backlog um started to
 
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.030 align:start position:0%
that's why the backlog um started to
grow

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
now what we did was because of the
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
impacts on the highway fund we looked at
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
the capital fund to fund equipment
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
because the operating budget couldn't
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
sustain it so in three different areas
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
fiscally a 16
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
there was a five million dollar capital
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
fund um
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know approved in the capital budget
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
in 2018 10 million was approved for that
 
01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:19.109 align:start position:0%
in 2018 10 million was approved for that
biennium

01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then in 2020 additional 10 million
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
was approved in
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
that biennium um which was great
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
it really helped with you know little
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know whittle down that backlog
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
um however you know the debt service
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
on those bonds is paid out of the
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know over um a 20-year period so
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
um although the upfront revenue
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
is great it does have a long-term
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
negative impact on
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh chris do we have any idea what the uh
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
how much we're paying an interest on
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
this on these
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
marie would you know um i can get back
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
to you on that
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
um actually in the last two capital
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
budgets uh they required
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
the capital portions to be paid back
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
over 10 years to be more
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
comparative with their useful life so
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
there is even a quicker
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
um payback schedule for that that's in
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
our operating budget but
 
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
i can get back to you on that on the
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
interest portion of
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
of these uh capital items so
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
the the the cost you said is in your
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
um yes for the for the probably the
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
previous two
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
um the 5 million and the first 10
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
million those are in
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
we're paying debt service on those now
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
in our operating budget the second
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
10 million um is it will just be
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
starting in the 2223 budget we've spent
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
about seven and a half million of that
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
and i know treasury um that was part of
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
their bond that they went out in
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
december for
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
so we'll probably start seeing the the
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
debt service for that in 2223
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
and we have included that in our in our
 
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
and we have included that in our in our
budget

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i just want to touch on you know uh
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 20 and 21
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh biennium um in the budget there so
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
um the class 30 appropriations
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
um was at a level that was sustainable
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
you know 8.3 and 8.9 million
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 20 as i noted earlier
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
um covet and the impact on the highway
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
fund revenue
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
um we stopped at
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know probably march or april of um
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
so it was near the final quarter of of
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
that fiscal year
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
we stopped any other um expenses on
 
01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.430 align:start position:0%
we stopped any other um expenses on
equipment

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
so we ended up lapsing 716 000
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
and as i noted earlier we had planned
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
to elapse four million but as we
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed our lapse targets we feel we
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
can meet
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
um the revised lapse target
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
in other areas and we can fully expend
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 21 budget on equipment
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
which you know which is really good news
 
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.549 align:start position:0%
which you know which is really good news
um

01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
i do you know i do want to stress that
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
the current the department's current
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
budget is
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
um i believe 2.9 million
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
um the current budget proposal for 22
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
and 23
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
is 2.9 million for equipment so we're
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
getting back down
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
to that that level that is not
 
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
to that that level that is not
sustainable

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
and will increase the backlog so when we
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know probably our highest unfunded
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
need um it is equipment and you know
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
trying to fund it at that eight to nine
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
million dollar level each year
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll be happy to answer any
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
questions the
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
the committee may have any questions
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
oh all right tom i'll let you go ahead
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you madame i'm just uh i'm
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
just not clear on
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
what chris what you're saying about um
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
the four million dollar laps and how
 
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.950 align:start position:0%
the four million dollar laps and how
that

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
that was between this slide and the
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
previous slide you mentioned something
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
about the four million dollar laps
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
coming off the 16 million dollars so
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative maybe i'll try and
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
explain it in different words um
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
to see if um we can be clearer and then
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
chris can jump in
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
so when while the legislature increased
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
for equipment replacement in the last
 
01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:52.950 align:start position:0%
for equipment replacement in the last
biennium

01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
because of the timing of covet 19 there
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
was some purchases
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020 that were underway
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
but as chris explained
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
when covet struck in the march we froze
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
our spending
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
so while you had approved 8 million in
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
we did not spend all of those dollars to
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
allow us to lapse funds in 2020
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
this year it was the opposite we started
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
the year being very frugal
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not wanting to spend um the eight
 
01:07:20.319 --> 01:07:21.109 align:start position:0%
i'm not wanting to spend um the eight
million

01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
we had done lapse projections and based
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
on what we were hoping to lapse
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
um there was about four million
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
equipment purchases that we'd put on
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
hold but then as we worked with the
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
governor and we understood where
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
revenues were trending
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
and then as marie worked with all of our
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
administrators and directors to look at
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
our laps targets
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
we're very comfortable now authorizing
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
mechanical services to move forward with
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
an additional four million in equipment
 
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.589 align:start position:0%
an additional four million in equipment
purchases

01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
purchases
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
things that we put on hold but now that
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
we have more clarity around this
 
01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:49.589 align:start position:0%
we have more clarity around this
upcoming

01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
upcoming
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
biennium we feel comfortable
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
allowing them to purchase 4 million more
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
four million dollars more in equipment
 
01:07:57.359 --> 01:07:58.150 align:start position:0%
four million dollars more in equipment
than

01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
um what they had intended to do earlier
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
in the year
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner so that does that
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
mean that this 16 million dollar
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
shortfall is 12 million correct yes
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay very good thank you this was
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
the snapshot in november
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
based on revenues and what we thought we
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
had to lapse what chris was sharing is
 
01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:19.749 align:start position:0%
had to lapse what chris was sharing is
that

01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
just a couple of weeks ago we've
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
authorized mechanical services to
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
actually move forward with four million
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
dollars more in equipment purchases
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
which makes the gap a little smaller
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay my my question is
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
on the um you call it alternative
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
funding i guess that's capital
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
is it's a mix of either capital or vw
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
or daira which is a federal program uh
 
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.349 align:start position:0%
or daira which is a federal program uh
okay

01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay so where
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
do we stand on spending those dollars
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
because if i if i look at this
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
and you you're indicating that you had
 
01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
and you you're indicating that you had
an

01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
additional 11 million in
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
2021 has that been
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
spent or not spent or is that
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
can we carry it over to 20 22
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
23 i'm just trying to understand
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on with this 11 million
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so i would go ahead marie i was
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
just gonna say about
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
two and a half million of that 11.6
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
is there's still a balance in the
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
capital program and we are
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
next week we'll be asking for a lapse
 
01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.829 align:start position:0%
next week we'll be asking for a lapse
extension

01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
um to be able to spend that in 2223 so
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
we are intending
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring that forward so that
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
so 2.5 you you've spent all but 2.5 of
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
the 11 million
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct okay and you're going
 
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct okay and you're going
to

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
try to move that two and a half
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
forward to 22-23
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
yep okay is that going to be through a
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
lapse or through an actual identifying
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
it as
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
it it'll be hb 25
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
requesting a lapse extension so we're
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're actually meeting with public works
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
next friday
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
on our laps extension request so this is
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
this will be one of the items on the
 
01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
this will be one of the items on the
list

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
um for our laps extensions that we'll be
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
requesting to bring forward
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
just as we were hesitant to spend
 
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
just as we were hesitant to spend
operating

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
dollars during the covert period there
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
was a number of our capital budget items
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
were put on hold
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we have our new capital budget
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
request that we'll be presenting
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
um to the committee but then there's
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
also a list of projects where we didn't
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
move forward in the same time
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
frame that we had expected because of
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
the revenue uncertainties
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
and our concerns around having the
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
operating budget to pay debt service
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll be asking for extensions on all
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the prior
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
hb 25 items that we hadn't completed so
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
that we can move forward with that work
 
01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.430 align:start position:0%
that we can move forward with that work
now

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
and marie has done the forecasting and
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
we do have the debt service budgeted
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'm what i'm trying to
 
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.709 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'm what i'm trying to
understand

01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
is you have asked us to
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
look at additional funding for
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
equipment and in the past
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
two years you have
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
received 19 million
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
for equipment purchases if i'm you know
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly correct me if i'm
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
wrong and
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
you still have
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
2.1 million that
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
has not been spent is it am i correct
 
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.030 align:start position:0%
has not been spent is it am i correct
and

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
what i'm talking about or am i wrong i'm
 
01:12:10.239 --> 01:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
what i'm talking about or am i wrong i'm
pleased

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
i believe in the last last two years 20
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
and 21
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's 28 million that we have allocated
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
to equipment
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
8.3 million in the operating budget in
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
20 8.9 million
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget in 21 and then
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
11.6 million
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
in capital as well as vw funding
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
so the way that we've talked about this
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
before representative
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
we want to get the operating budget you
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
know up to a level where we can maintain
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
the fleet going forward
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
so we've been talking about you know we
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
should be spending eight or nine million
 
01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:47.830 align:start position:0%
should be spending eight or nine million
annually

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's to replace vehicles as they
 
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.830 align:start position:0%
that's to replace vehicles as they
become

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
as they hit that sort of 12-year range
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
and start to be problematic and costly
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
to keep on the road
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to increase the
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
operating budget to a point that we can
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
keep pace
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
going forward and then we've primarily
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
been using the capital budget dollars to
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
try and address the backlog
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the easiest way to think
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
of it and so while we're very
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
appreciative of all the capital money
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we still have a significant
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
backlog of trucks that are beyond their
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
useful life
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
and while we gradually play catch up on
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
that side
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
every day there's other vehicles that
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
are aging out and becoming problematic
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just i'm just trying to uh
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
understand um you know where we are
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
i i know what you're talking about i and
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's good that you're
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
looking out there but i i need to
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
i have things i have to address so
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:53.669 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
question

01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much again um
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
so to put you right um it would be
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
around the 12 million dollars
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
to get you back to get you to a point
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
where you can be sustainable
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
what do you need and i know this isn't
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen anytime soon but what
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
what is the estimate that you need to be
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
sustainable assuming that you
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know you reached that point does
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
that am i did i ask that
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
clearly it's it's the 8.9 million
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
a year in our operating budget so we'll
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
get to the 12 minute get 12 million
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
would get you to the point where you
 
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:27.430 align:start position:0%
would get you to the point where you
would

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
need 8 million yearly to maintain the
 
01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:30.950 align:start position:0%
need 8 million yearly to maintain the
fleet

01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
fleet
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
correct thank you yeah if you think of
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
it as a 12 million
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
backlog and then we need 8 million
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
and the backlog is much smaller than it
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
was going into the last
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
budget because of the support we
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
received from the legislature
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you have a question
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes i and i'm so i just want to sort of
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
follow up on the question you are asking
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
madam chairman i just want to make sure
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
that i'm so if if
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
if you got your for lack of a better
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
term if you got your wish list
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
we would be we would be providing
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars in funding to allow
 
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.709 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars in funding to allow
you

01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
to make up for
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
what was not provided in ask biennium's
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
and then another eight million dollars
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
for uh for what you need going forward
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct so it would be it would
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
be a total of uh
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's 8 million annually but there is
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
some money in the budget so it's the
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
difference between what's currently
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget um on the
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
numbers that we showed
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm okay i'm sorry i see i see okay so
 
01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
i'm okay i'm sorry i see i see okay so
the

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
total for this biennium will be about 24
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
million so it's the 12 million backlog
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
plus the 12 million we're short to get
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
eight you know eight nine million per
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
year so the total would be about 24
 
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.669 align:start position:0%
year so the total would be about 24
million

01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
24 million okay all right thank you
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
if i may i know that's a big ask um
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy with just restoring the
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
to that nine million dollar level
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
um if we could if we could restore the
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget in each year to that
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
nine million dollar level so
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
so it's 12 million in the biennium i
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
think that would be fantastic
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
so we do not fall any further behind um
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
on the backlog and the backlog stays
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
at its current level because we've done
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
a great job
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
and you know thank you to the
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and and the government
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
in past years um to support our capital
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
budget request as well as
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know funding fully funding the
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
the uh operating budget for equipment in
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
the last biennium
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
that helped greatly to reduce the
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
backlog from
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
it was even higher is that probably
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
previous statistics probably showed it
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
grown to
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
35 36 million so it's been a fantastic
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
job to reduce it
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned i'd be thrilled if just
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
the operating budget was restored to uh
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
the sustainable level
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
i would be thrilled too chris so how are
 
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.010 align:start position:0%
you gonna get people to drive more
 
01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:35.189 align:start position:0%
you gonna get people to drive more
[Laughter]

01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
so the next the next slide is um
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's a budget change request we have so
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is something
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
you would vote on today or another
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
meeting but
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
these are some minor changes that we
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
become aware of
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
that we believe should be in the fy 2223
 
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
that we believe should be in the fy 2223
budget

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
so the first one is in our
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
transit bureau there is a new project
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
with the department of natural and
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
cultural resources
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
um and so there's a grant from dmcr
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand dollars um so
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
utilize that grant we need to get that
 
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.270 align:start position:0%
utilize that grant we need to get that
budgeted

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the pro into the fy 22
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
23 budget um along with the
 
01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.070 align:start position:0%
23 budget um along with the
appropriation

01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
for that uh
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's the first request on those
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
first three lines there excuse me
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh mickey do we need to uh
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
vote on these or do we just ask you to
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
make the changes since the money is
 
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.350 align:start position:0%
make the changes since the money is
there

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you vote we could we
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
could just vote just to make sure we
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't uh
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
have any uncertainty on the action um i
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
just have one question on this for marie
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
do you know if um cultural and natural
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
resources has this 100 000 already
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted on their end or would we have
 
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.189 align:start position:0%
budgeted on their end or would we have
to

01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
work with division one on theirs i
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
i am not sure that is a very good
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
so on that first one i'd say we maybe
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
just want to confirm with division one i
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
can talk to um
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
nancy in our office just to see what's
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
going on with that side of it but the
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
other two look
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to affect your
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
highway or general fund situation
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the division and they're uh we could
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
vote as a division today on those and i
 
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.470 align:start position:0%
vote as a division today on those and i
could

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
get get moving on them
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
maybe the first one we hold off until we
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
the second item is also with uh down
 
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.110 align:start position:0%
the second item is also with uh down
here

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
on one these five lines here
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is also with our transit
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
bureau these are federal funds so these
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
were funds
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
that fta was provided in the coronavirus
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
relief bill
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of december and
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
but you know between the governor's
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
phase and now the house phase it was
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
identified specifically how much
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was getting and these are
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
you know directly go through the fta and
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
through our bureau
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
so there's no um you know they're
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
they're tied to specific
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
um transit agencies so we'd like to
 
01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:27.669 align:start position:0%
um transit agencies so we'd like to
budget

01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
these federal funds um in fy22
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that we're able to distribute them
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
according to
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
and then the last item um these
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
this a new program that we just became
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
aware of our new revenue that we just
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
became aware of
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
related to uh alton bay lease agreements
 
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:52.390 align:start position:0%
related to uh alton bay lease agreements
um

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
so we we would like to appropriate that
 
01:20:55.199 --> 01:20:55.590 align:start position:0%
so we we would like to appropriate that
um

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
the revenue and we have to pay property
 
01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
the revenue and we have to pay property
taxes

01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
um on those uh lease agreements
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
so we would that's why we're
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
appropriating uh
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
funds in land interest to be able to pay
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
the property taxes
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
um based on the the land that we own
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
there and the revenue that we'll be
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
are receiving so again
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
like mickey said none of this impacts
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
the highway or general fund they're all
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining revenues that are coming
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
in to be appropriated for these programs
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
marie should we bring these in through
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal or
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
i i would prefer them in the budget um
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
if we go you know if we go through
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal then i have we wait until
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
july and especially with those federal
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
funds then the transit
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
can't distribute those funds to the
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
transit agencies until we've gone
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
through fiscal and governor and council
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
and received approval so it could delay
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
them distributing
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
the funds by a month or two if we have
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
to wait for that
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
time period i don't i don't have any
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have any problem with that uh
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
mary you have a
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if i could make a motion
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
um that that and my motion would be
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you before i make the motion i
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
just would um request that we
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
um approve spending authority for those
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
would that be okay that would be fine
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
all right so um that said i would like
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
them to move that we provide funding
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
authority for the two
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
items as listed
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%

dollar value
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
like um
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%

01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
going through your budget uh
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
with any additional questions that we
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
um so what we're
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is to come
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
to grips with uh where we stand
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
on the on the highway fund
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
and where we stand on the general fund
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
um i know it was helpful
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
that the the governor uh
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
suggested that we have more money than
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
we do from his phase
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
but um unless that changes
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
in uh ways and means
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know what we're gonna do but and
 
01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:58.550 align:start position:0%
i don't know what we're gonna do but and
also

01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't be surprised if uh
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
the senate takes these two things out of
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
because they don't like to put federal
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
dollars in the budget
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll see we'll see what happens
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
we'll put them in
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
and maybe they will not notice
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
this small amount of money so we'll
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
we'll try to to get that
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
satisfied so is
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
there anything else that anyone would
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
like to say
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
do you want oh i apologize i
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
mean to interrupt um i didn't know if we
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about hb2 at all
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
we have four or five items in hb2 oh
 
01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.229 align:start position:0%
we have four or five items in hb2 oh
absolutely

01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%

01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you i uh
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that was gonna be my question madam
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
chair i don't know whether you want to
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
do the hb2 items today
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
or maybe cover those when we come back
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
in for our next session
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
oh because i've got to send those off
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
committees and i want to i want to hear
 
01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:09.030 align:start position:0%
committees and i want to i want to hear
your

01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
your take on it before i
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
i get something back from them so we're
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
ready to speak to them we can do that
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
today if it
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
is the most convenient in terms of the
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
schedule that's great
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so i know
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
um our items start on page 61 of hb2
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh so this is related to uh civil
 
01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:46.149 align:start position:0%
uh so this is related to uh civil
liability

01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
um the the rsa currently as it reads
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and as interpreted by the attorney
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
um is that we can only
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed on actual costs um
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
related to damage to our highways
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
generally what we've done in the past is
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
we use an estimated cost
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
because it's difficult for us maybe
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
during the winter
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know to be able to assess the full
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
damage we will do an estimate and so we
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and others waiting
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
multiple months for the snow to melt
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be you know to do the repairs and all
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
those things we provide estimates and
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
that is the industry standard with the
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
insurance industries is they'll
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
accept estimates um the ag's office is
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
um has suggested we need actuals
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
and so what we're looking here to do is
 
01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:38.590 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
to um
[Music]

01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
update the the definition of full and
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
current replacement costs
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
to allow reasonable estimates or actual
 
01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:49.750 align:start position:0%
to allow reasonable estimates or actual
costs

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
so that that's what we're doing here so
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
that we can you know
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
receive as much back as we can get
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the damage that's done to the
 
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.470 align:start position:0%
for the damage that's done to the
highways

01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
highways
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh i i have a question marie does this
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
is this something that uh the
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
transportation committee
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
will deal with or is this something that
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
public works would deal with
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure we do have it in a
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
concurrent uh place senate it is in
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 134 currently
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
moving through the judiciary committee
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
there they have a civil liability
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh bill so um i i wanted to be sure that
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
it didn't get dropped so i have it in
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
both places
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to make sure that the
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
the language does get through
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah while this pertains to highway
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's really
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
about um how insurance claims are
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
processed and making sure that you know
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
we are being timely
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
and providing the necessary information
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
to the insurance company
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
but then also able to receive
 
01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.189 align:start position:0%
but then also able to receive
compensation

01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
as quickly as as possible as well rather
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
than waiting as we described
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
for the summer construction season
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
so i don't know on the house side which
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee they would have
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
passed this bill to but it's more of a
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
as marie mentioned it's before the
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
judicial committee on the senate side
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
well i'll just send it to all 24
 
01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.830 align:start position:0%
well i'll just send it to all 24
committees

01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
good question um
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um commissioner do you know
 
01:33:32.159 --> 01:33:32.950 align:start position:0%
thank you um commissioner do you know
why

01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
the ag's office made that change when
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
your practice was estimation
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
i think we have a new individual
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for this program who was
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
reviewing the rsa
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay and we agree when you look at the
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
language this change really is necessary
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
um but previously they had just
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
supported the department's practice
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is really updating statute to
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
reflect what we've been doing
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
i see thank you make sure that we have
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
the protections that we need that is
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate to handle these claims in
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay i saw nothing wrong with it when i
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
read it but i
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
i just didn't know who needed to take
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
care of that okay
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh so the next is section 134
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the repeal of a law from 1959
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh related to sandwich notch and dale
 
01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.110 align:start position:0%
uh related to sandwich notch and dale
road

01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
in the towns of uh sandwich in thornton
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
that uh law requires us to pay
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of money per mile to
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
um provide winter main funds for winter
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance for those roads
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um now since the block grant law was
 
01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.870 align:start position:0%
um now since the block grant law was
passed

01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
those towns are also receiving money
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
from block grant aid
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh to support those roads so it's really
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
double counting the
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
amount of funds that they're getting
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
compared to other communities for that
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
portion of roadway so we'd like to
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
repeal the law from 1959
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
and just continue with the you know them
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
getting credit in the block grant for
 
01:35:10.719 --> 01:35:11.430 align:start position:0%
getting credit in the block grant for
those

01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
for that roadway that length of roadway
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
and getting that
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
um the funds really through block grant
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
that sounds to me like a public works
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue is that correct
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
um yes i would take that to public works
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
for their concurrence from a policy
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
perspective since they're involved
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan and the budgeting
 
01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.149 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan and the budgeting
around

01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
the block grant okay thank you
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray you have a
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you madam chair i'm
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
curious are they actually
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
getting um double funds or is this just
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
a matter of moving one from the other
 
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:53.830 align:start position:0%
a matter of moving one from the other
there

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
or and if they are getting double funds
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
um they they are getting double funds i
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that they
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
realize that i think their i know
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner or bill cass i think has
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
been involved with this a little bit
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
more i believe the community
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
is aware that they're receiving the
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
funding from two places and that really
 
01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.030 align:start position:0%
funding from two places and that really
it's

01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
unfair that they get additional dollars
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
compared to other communities
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things it's been discussed
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
with the with the town and ev everybody
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
agrees that you know cleaning this up is
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
the best case it's it's very nominal
 
01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
the best case it's it's very nominal
amount

01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
of uh it's like seventeen hundred
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
dollars is
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
based on the 1955 vlar or something so
 
01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.350 align:start position:0%
based on the 1955 vlar or something so
it's

01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
really more of an administ it's as much
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
of an administrative
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
um challenge to keep track of and uh
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
so everybody agrees that this is the
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
best the best thing to do
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
saw that in hb2 and i said oh that's a
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting i didn't know
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
sandwich notch road was
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think it's just maintenance of
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
of sandwich notch
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
road uh you know in past we've done like
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
like um
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
you know like uh
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
materials type of stuff a few loads of
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
gravel to fix some things but it's more
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's more just
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance and upkeep it's not i don't
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
think it is maintenance it wasn't
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
specifically winter maintenance it was
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance of
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
sandwich nacho road okay thank you
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
d.o.t always has interesting things in
 
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:35.430 align:start position:0%
d.o.t always has interesting things in
hp2

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
hp2
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
so the next section is uh 135 which is
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
line 32
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
on page 61. um and that's related to
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
um disposal of real estate
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to add disposal of
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
add federal real estate in there along
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
turnpike and highway funded and then in
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
section 136
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're asking um that
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
are restricted federal that are
 
01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.830 align:start position:0%
are restricted federal that are
restricted

01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
that basically it's the proceeds from
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
the sale of land
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
related to payback so for federal funds
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
like the conway payback
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
that those funds be restricted
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds within our budget and be
 
01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:25.030 align:start position:0%
federal funds within our budget and be
utilized

01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
for additional like federal projects and
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
that type of thing uh
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
currently go ahead i apologize
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
you don't have to apologize it was me so
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
you're asking for 135 and 136 to be
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
changed a little bit is that correct yes
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh will you and
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh mickey get together to figure out
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
sure okay and then uh
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
what i'll do is um i will hold off
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
on sending that to uh
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
ice public works i assume that until we
 
01:39:11.679 --> 01:39:11.990 align:start position:0%
ice public works i assume that until we
get

01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
so then page 62 section 137
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
which is line 8. um
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
and this goes through sections 138 139
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
as well um this is related to
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
um unmanned aircraft so basically our
 
01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.590 align:start position:0%
um unmanned aircraft so basically our
drones

01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
drones
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
um we need um we'd like to add the word
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
unmanned into the small aircraft or to
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
small aircraft currently technically the
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
way the law reads
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
um it might require us to register
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
all of the drones and to collect
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
registration fees
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
so this is really a clarification um
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the law and what a small unmanned
 
01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:16.629 align:start position:0%
of the law and what a small unmanned
aircraft

01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
aircraft
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
is so that we don't you know so that no
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
one interprets that we need to collect
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
registration fees
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
because we have no intention of
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
collecting registration fees on
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
the drone aircraft right now there's
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
currently no definition in statute
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
we drones are certainly aircraft
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
but having this broad definition um it
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
is confusing
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
there's also federal outlaws that
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
pertain to
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
unmanned aircraft and so this definition
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
allows us to make it clear that
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of aircraft you
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
know a drone or unmanned
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
versus a traditional plane um
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
we would be referencing the respective
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
sections of the federal statutes
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
so i can basically send this
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
to a transportation committee
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
and suggest they enter
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
the term unmanned is that
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
is that what i'm hearing yeah the um
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
proposed languages
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
in hb2 so it's the several sections that
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
marie referenced
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all of the statutes
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
that pertain to aircraft are updated
 
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.830 align:start position:0%
that pertain to aircraft are updated
accordingly

01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
but yes transportation would be the
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate committee for that to go to
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
for consideration
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay and and if we'll take care of it
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative hamburger uh yes let's
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
ask maria quick question
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
on these sections that we just went
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
through if they were to come out of
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 would any house bill 1
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
modifications be required is there a
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
direct tie to these sections to any of
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
um the repeal of the sandwich notch and
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
dale road i might want to
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
update you know it would be small money
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
but block grant you know would
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
would need to be adjusted because we
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
to to account for this if it didn't if
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
this didn't pass
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
but no there are no lines tied to these
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
in the budget currently
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
all of these do have a financial aspect
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
to them however
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
especially uh with the aircraft
 
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.990 align:start position:0%
especially uh with the aircraft
registrations

01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
um we want that clarified in statute so
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we're not accused
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
of failing to collect additional revenue
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
but based on how our aircraft
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
registration fees are established
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
this if we were to apply the same
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
standard to drones it would be
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
a disproportionate amount
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
of registration fee relative to the
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay i believe that's it is that correct
 
01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.229 align:start position:0%
okay i believe that's it is that correct
marie

01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
marie
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
the last one is section 140 um
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
and that relates to the the 8.1 million
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
transfer to the general fund
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
i mean transfer to the highway fund so
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is the lapse to the highway fund
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
but and this relates to that 8.1 million
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
so the original appropriation was the 20
 
01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:38.950 align:start position:0%
so the original appropriation was the 20
million

01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
in the law um we
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
we've spent everything except the 8.1
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
million on that final bridge so
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
it was originally non-lapsing so to be
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
able to lapse
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
the 8.1 million and put that into the
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
highway fund this language needs to be
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
i assume you will get with mickey to
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
this 8.1 is already carried on the
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
surplus statement
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
so it is who accepted it as is we're
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
already counting on that 8.1 million
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
dollar support
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
to balance the highway fund as it stands
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
do we need to take it out of hb2 or
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
no no this is uh this would be an
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for it in house bill 2
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
and then we just carry it as an
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
appropriation adjustment really
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
or a revenue adjustment on the surplus
 
01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.830 align:start position:0%
or a revenue adjustment on the surplus
statement

01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
and those are the items we currently
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
have in hb2 um
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner i didn't know if you want
 
01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:55.700 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to discuss
 
01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:57.750 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to discuss
[Music]

01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
potential if there's a potential
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
increase in our lapse
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
whether we have some authority to
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we have been
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
discussing is um
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
in light of both our high vacancy rate
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
as well as our ongoing support for the
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
statewide response to covet 19.
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
we may actually exceed our current lapse
 
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.350 align:start position:0%
we may actually exceed our current lapse
projections

01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
projections
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
um depending on how successful we are as
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
we try to recruit and fill positions now
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
the harring
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
freeze has been lifted so we have
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
we were wondering if there might be an
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
appetite to discuss
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
should our laps exceed the projections
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
would there be a willingness to include
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
language in hb2
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
that if we far exceeded our laps
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
um as shown in the surplus statement
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
we'd have the authority to
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
move go to fiscal and move that money um
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
address some of the fleet challenges
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's assuming of course that through
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
the budget process we don't
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
increase the investment in the fleet
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
that there you know truly be that need
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's similar to what's had happened in
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
the past when we showed you the sb
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
367 waterfall um
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know there was in those early years
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
before we entered into the tiffy alone
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
um there was money that was transferred
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
from sb 367 into the operating budget
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
when we had additional dollars remaining
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
we were able to use some of that revenue
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
for both equipment as well as some
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
roadway work so this is it's not the
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
first time that we would have
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
um worked with the legislature on
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
something of this nature
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
but you know if we especially if we were
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
to have a very mild winter
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we didn't need all of the winter
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance dollars
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
um it makes a lot of sense to take the
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
money that was budgeted for the winter
 
01:46:57.119 --> 01:46:57.830 align:start position:0%
money that was budgeted for the winter
season

01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
season
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
and buy new equipment and trucks to
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
improve our performance that next winter
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
so we haven't drafted any language we
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to talk with the committee
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
to see if that was something that you
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
wanted us to explore
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then we'd be happy to work with
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
mickey and see if there's some language
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable to the
 
01:47:13.679 --> 01:47:14.790 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable to the
committee

01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
even if it's just something for you to
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
consider that we actually wrote this
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
up as a concept for you to discuss it
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
further and then
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
make your ultimate decision
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative murray i believe you were
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
how'd you end up first
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure but uh oops i'm not sure
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
but i'll be quick
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
i mean kovitz hurt everybody but my
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
heart just goes out to transportation
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
for what you've had to deal with in
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
terms of you're trying to manage these
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
very long-term things so i would say i
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be totally supportive of
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
pretty near anything that helps you deal
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
with your maintenance issues and if this
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
is one of them i'm
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
 
01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:56.709 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
chair

01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
and uh commissioner i i i'm of the same
 
01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.189 align:start position:0%
and uh commissioner i i i'm of the same
mind

01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
but what i'm looking for is you want
 
01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
but what i'm looking for is you want
clarification

01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
noted in hb2 giving you the authority
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
to expend lapse funds that exceed
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
correct we'd work on the specific
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
language but that is the intent
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
if our lapse amount significantly
 
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.390 align:start position:0%
if our lapse amount significantly
exceeded

01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
our lapse targets the authority to
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
go through fiscal and move um forward
 
01:48:31.679 --> 01:48:31.990 align:start position:0%
go through fiscal and move um forward
with

01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
fleet purchases using those additional
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
available dollars
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you if i could just
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
clarify something there are no actual
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
required lapse amounts we
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
we estimate elapsed we carry a lapse
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
estimate on the surplus statement
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
but it would be possibly it's happened
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
before but it's certainly unusual to
 
01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:54.070 align:start position:0%
before but it's certainly unusual to
legislate

01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
a lapse amount and then say above this
 
01:48:57.119 --> 01:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
a lapse amount and then say above this
amount

01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
x shall be used for a certain purpose so
 
01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
x shall be used for a certain purpose so
um

01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
this would be something new but
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
certainly not something
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay so marie i guess you and mickey
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
need to talk
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay and uh and try you know
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
i i understand where where you're uh
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh but it may be
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
better to try to um
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
get this into the senate
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
in the actual hb1 because
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
you may know more in april
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know as or may march and that says
 
01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:49.430 align:start position:0%
you know as or may march and that says
march

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
march
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
april and may as you're going through
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
the um going through the budget
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you know you're you know that
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more in there than
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
what you know about right now but that's
 
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:04.709 align:start position:0%
what you know about right now but that's
just

01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
and like i said we're very optimistic
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
that you know there'll be either relief
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
dollars or stimulus dollars that might
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
be able to address some of these fleet
 
01:50:15.679 --> 01:50:16.229 align:start position:0%
be able to address some of these fleet
needs

01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
um but we're just thinking of all the
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
options available to us
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
i i totally agree and uh if
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
mickey and marie can figure something
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
out then we'll
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
add it to hb2 um
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
if we yeah if we if we have the dollars
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else that you
 
01:50:44.159 --> 01:50:44.709 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else that you
would

01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
that is all that i had on the agenda
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't know commissioners if you had
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
anything else but
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
no i think we covered everything that
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
we'd hoped to present
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't know madam chair as we
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
prepare for next week you mentioned we'd
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
go through the budget line by line but
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
please don't hesitate to reach out if
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's other items you would like us to
 
01:51:10.159 --> 01:51:11.510 align:start position:0%
there's other items you would like us to
revisit

01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
revisit
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
or details that we could provide i think
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
we only had one action and that was to
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
go back and look at
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
the debt service associated with the
 
01:51:19.119 --> 01:51:20.629 align:start position:0%
the debt service associated with the
fleet

01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
fleet
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
purchases that's correct and
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
and um i really want to thank you
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
for your presentation today
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
i think it has helped all of us to
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
understand where we are with the
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
with your part of the highway fund and
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
other divisions have
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
asked that we a lot or
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
departments that we allow them
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
to hire as long as they have
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
money in the budget so that if
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know joe retires and he works in
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
the maintenance garage but you don't
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
need another
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
person in the maintenance garage and
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
need them someplace else
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
that um you can do that
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what i don't know how
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
how you think about hiring or
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
any of that kind of stuff but i would
 
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
like you
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
to at least think about that and because
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
it it is an option for uh
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
for the departments uh mickey i don't
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
know if you want to add anything on that
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
so for reference i think uh
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative is referring to
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
the authority to fill unfunded positions
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
and it's something in house bill 2 that
 
01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:53.189 align:start position:0%
and it's something in house bill 2 that
hhs

01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
currently has authority to do so if you
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
look at section 21 of house bill 2
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
um that will that's that's along the
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
lines of what representative amber is
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so certainly you know the current
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
process we have our
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
approved funded positions in the budget
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
and at any
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
time we want to deviate we have to go
 
01:53:14.719 --> 01:53:15.830 align:start position:0%
time we want to deviate we have to go
through

01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
the reclassification process which is
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
time consuming
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
so any flexibility that would allow us
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
to be nimble um
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
and move forward with emerging needs you
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
know for example
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we just talked about drones in that
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
emerging industry we had to wait and get
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
a 7d
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
approved for that position um through
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
or we have to reclassify one of our
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
existing positions so
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
the more latitude we have
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh being able to hire
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
um the easier it is for us to manage
 
01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:47.910 align:start position:0%
um the easier it is for us to manage
especially

01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
as conditions change and um
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
yes we you know i hope you have
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
confidence in the department
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
given our presentations that we watch
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
our budget very very closely
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
that we would be managing all of our
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
payroll lines accordingly if we had that
 
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:04.870 align:start position:0%
payroll lines accordingly if we had that
latitude

01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
latitude
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
to move forward with filling positions
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
the governor just lifted the hiring
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
freeze but we have still worked closely
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
with all of our
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
divisions and hr to meter what positions
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
we're posting
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
focusing on the highest needs first and
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
we are very much aware of the health of
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
the highway fund that's um
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
something that again i hope you have
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
confidence that the numbers we're
 
01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.270 align:start position:0%
confidence that the numbers we're
presenting

01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
and truly reflect the situation and we
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
do everything we can
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
to manage within our budget commissioner
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
if i didn't have faith
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
in what you're doing i wouldn't have
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
offered that okay
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
so if marie and mickey can
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh can get together on that as well and
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
we'll um
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it works and i should
 
01:54:50.239 --> 01:54:50.709 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it works and i should
acknowledge

01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
acknowledge
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel you know they
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
work very hard they partner with us but
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
like i said
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
classif the classification system is
 
01:54:58.159 --> 01:54:58.870 align:start position:0%
classif the classification system is
cumbersome

01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
and you know having to reclassify
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
positions is extremely time consuming
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're forced to do when
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have exactly
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
the mix of positions that we need um
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
so this would probably help them out in
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
terms of reducing the workload as well
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay is there are there is there are
 
01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.950 align:start position:0%
okay is there are there is there are
there

01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the uh
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
dot folks again thank you so much
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%

01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%

01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
