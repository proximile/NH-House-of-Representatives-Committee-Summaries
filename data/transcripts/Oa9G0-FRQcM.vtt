00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
division 3 uh this is uh the 14th of
 
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.910 align:start position:0%
division 3 uh this is uh the 14th of
February

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
February
 
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
2025 we've got two bills uh on our
 
00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
agenda today hp71
 
00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.469 align:start position:0%
agenda today hp71
HP

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
HP
 
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
519 both with um a fiscal note and and
 
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
then we have an amendment floating
 
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
around that I I hope to talk about um to
 
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
to to you know see if we can get aligned
 
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
on the right way to settle those down so
 
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple just technically I think it
 
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
would be more efficient if we talked
 
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
about HB 59 first okay um but uh do am I
 
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
required to go in the order that's
 
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
presented you're not okay
 
00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 align:start position:0%
okay so um based on conversations and
 
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
some testimony from uh and and do we
 
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
amendment so I have the amendment to 519
 
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
that was handed out at the public
 
00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 align:start position:0%
hearing last week I also have your
 
00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to House Bill 71 okay
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
so let's go ahead and uh when you get a
 
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
chance hand out the amendment to 71 is
 
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
it in our packet
 
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
already okay all right
 
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
so again based on testimony and
 
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
conversations um uh there there uh it it
 
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
it it it became
 
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
clear that um there's a a a preference
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
um out of out of politeness and respect
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh and to further assure uh the primary
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of that
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
Waypoint U that we were going to keep a
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
commitment to consider them in the
 
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
budget process and um and although they
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
were told on record um that they should
 
00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
not worry about 519 there's still some
 
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
concern by in some quarters that that if
 
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
we do anything odd to 519 it's going to
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
cause con nation and shock waves so
 
00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
rather than do that um I think that the
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
amendment the non gerain amendment that
 
00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.750 align:start position:0%
amendment the non gerain amendment that
we

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
debated probably is better to go on to
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
hp71 and that we'll leave 519
 
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
alone and and uh we can't execute today
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
though right 519 out of division
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
three you could vote to make a
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation on 519 I think you
 
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't on House Bill 71 if you wanted
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
to offer this amendment right okay so so
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
so we may get to that uh here in a
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
moment but um so I my proposal is to
 
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.270 align:start position:0%
moment but um so I my proposal is to
leave

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
519 as
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
introduced um and retain
 
00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
519 as a
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
committee and to intend to take the
 
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
subject matter of 5199 and put it into
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 and in the budget process that's
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
going to take place over the next six
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
weeks determine uh the level that uh we
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
think we can fund it at so so without
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
committing to money I want to commit us
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
to a process of retaining 519 putting
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
the material in
 
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh and then determining at a later
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
date the the level of funding that's my
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's my proposal uh that's not a
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
motion but it's open for
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
discussion yes thank you very much um I
 
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for that um adjustment
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the plan I think that um there was
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
con concern about the Waypoint bill and
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
I appreciate um us being able to move
 
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
forward and keeping it clean um I'm
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
happy with that idea and um I don't wh I
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
see someone in the public wants to
 
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
comment so I will refrain from going on
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
too much further but um I just want to
 
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
say I appreciate that effort okay so we
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
still don't have a motion on the floor
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
but and I don't think we need one if do
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
you have um as a member of the public
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak about what we're
 
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
proposing to do on HB 519 if so this is
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
the time to go to the table and do that
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
and you need to introduce yourself
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
because the representative here needs
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
hi um members of the committee um my
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
name's Mary Rose De and um I have uh an
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
awareness of this bill and feel that the
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
monies could be used better spent to
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
teach the youth skills real skills that
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
they can use in the workplace rather
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
than um wasted on Mental Health Services
 
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
they could be taught how to use a
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
construction equipment or be taught a
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
skill a real skill rather than be told
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
that they're mental ill and disabled
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
they could be saying well you're able to
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
do these things you can get a forklift
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
and go out and plow snow or whatever and
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
we'll teach you how to do it rather than
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
just telling them that they're
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
nuts and helping these mental
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
health I consider them
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
frauders um get more money um it's to me
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
it's a waste of money that could be
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
better spent teaching real skills that
 
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
these people need to make it in the
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
world to have faith in themselves have
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
faith in their um
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
abilities have faith in their uh
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
feelings of success instead of being
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
told that they're crazy and will be
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
disabled for the rest of their lives so
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to this um Waypoint funding
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
bill um and uh would
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate maybe the Department of
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
Employment Security or some other skill
 
00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:21.790 align:start position:0%
Employment Security or some other skill
building

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
organizations could bid on um teaching
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
these people to have faith in
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
theirselves and their
 
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
abilities instead of telling them
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
they're disabled losers that the only
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
their only way out is to take drugs or
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
something they could feel confident that
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to have skills and go on
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
the work place or construction site and
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
um know how to wire an electrical
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
circuit or uh know how to build a
 
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
circuit board or something like that I I
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
I think we get the gist of your
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
testimony U are are you willing to take
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
questions yes I am okay this this this
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
these are questions this is not an
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
intent to debate you because we I would
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
not be very good at that but I'm just
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
seeing what's out there on the street
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
now how um the mental health system has
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
let these people down by telling them
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're disabled right and they're
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
losers and instead of just saying well
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
you're great person right here what
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to show you uh how to use a
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
sow okay yes uh so the subject matter of
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
this uh of 519 is really specifically
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
aimed at uh trying to provide uh
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
financial resources from the state for
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
the first time to Waypoint and their
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
shelter operation they have a shelter
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
operation of 14 and and they uh they do
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
have a program to do wraparound Services
 
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
similar not exactly but similar to what
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying they're trying to give
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
them some life skills are you are you
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Waypoint specifically
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
and their shelter and the wraparound
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
services that they provide um well I've
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
seen people on the street with similar
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
services that they get but yes ma'am I'm
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you specifically though if if
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
your comments are in general about Point
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
specific any kind of Mental Health
 
00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
Organization as such is basically
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
telling the people that they're disabled
 
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
l or nut jobs that can't get work and
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
will be losers for the rest of their
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
life and so they may as well take drugs
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
and hang around the streets sure and
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
even if they go to these things so I'm
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to I'm going to uh
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
conclude your testimony because I I
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
think we've heard you and understand you
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
your comment are in general related to
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
the entire way in which our system of
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
care is operating and not specifically
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
towards this the subject of this bill if
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's Mental Health Care Facility yeah
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
then it it's it's a waste time and money
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
right and um they're overcharging
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
they're overburdening the budgets of
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
states and local governments Federal
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%

discussion absolutely so I want to make
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand what the motion
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
was because what came out of
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
Representative priest was different than
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
what you said and I I have no problem
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill but uh at this point
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
in time I'm not I'm not ready to commit
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
it to House Bill two I'm ready to
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
okay it's
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
a horse and cart time and I'm trying to
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
get the two in my head uh I think before
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
we vote to recommend retaining we should
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
agree on what our intended disposition
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the material
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
is uh do you do you do you want to speak
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
further to your point about um fine with
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
the motion the way that representative
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
priest made
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
it you were a little more Concrete in
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
put putting it in House Bill
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
too right I I don't know if we're ready
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
for representative priest's motion would
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
you consider withdrawing it yes I'll
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
withdraw it all right um okay so now the
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
sequence I want to make sure that we've
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
had the discussion about taking the
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
material and putting it into
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 I I have not thought that the to be
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh controversial but I I think you have
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
a a point of view we need to understand
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I read through the annual
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
report and I mean one one thing I I
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
pulled out of there that was that you
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
know the organization is against against
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
the uh uh parents Bill of
 
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.509 align:start position:0%
the uh uh parents Bill of
Rights

00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think that some of the services
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
that they're providing are are fine but
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm somewhat concerned about some
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
culture that that I read in the annual
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
report as well so based on that uh I
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
feel that I'm I'm not ready to say that
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%

questions okay yes thank you um in the
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
annual report it indicated that two
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
staff members went to a and it's it's
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
like a five-word long uh diver came
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
across as a
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
diversity um reflection consultation
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
thing and uh I'd like to know a little
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
bit more about what that is about
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
absolutely so are you referencing kind
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
of the Dei initiatives that used to be
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
in place at wayp Point yes um so
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
obviously with the current with
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that is coming down from the
 
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
federal level and legislation that's on
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
the state level we have to comply with
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
legislation so those are things that we
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
time okay and
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
else I have a followup to your question
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels and that is um I
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think your testimony was is that um to
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
the extent that your uh Waypoint is
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
complying with things like the Dei
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh you're doing it in
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
compliance with um federal law at the at
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
the so it's a compliance issue and and
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh what what do you think the intent of
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
Waypoint is should the federal
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
government uh revoke its uh obligation
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
and removes the compliance issue from
 
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
you to um participate in in De training
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
well our priority first and foremost is
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
for the uh safety of Youth and children
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
and so anything that we can do to keep
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
the people and the population that we
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
serve safe that is going to take
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
precedence over anything and so whether
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
that is you know by uh
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
prioritizing um support by prioritizing
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
to vulnerable populations that's what
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
we're doing so whether it is in line
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
with Dei or not that is not the priority
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the priority is to help the vulnerable
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
populations that we
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
serve okay but as part of your
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
compliance check off the Dei component
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
would be removed I I I don't I don't
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
know how you manage compliance but I I
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
imagine there's sort of a compliance
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
checklist of all the things you have to
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
do just to maintain your rating and
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
everything uh is that is that something
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
you currently track and is that
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
something you would continue to track if
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
the government the feds revoked the
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
requirement well we would be compliant
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
with what is coming from the federal
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
government but if they remove the
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
compliance issue we would also be
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
compliant with what is coming from the
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
federal government now what we would do
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
as an organization if both of those that
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
all of that compliant was was taken back
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
that is something that I would have to
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
go to the CEO to ask so I can ask that
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
question and definitely get back to the
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
committee on that thank you do you have
 
00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
another question yes can you explain the
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
organization's opposition to the par
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
parents Bill of Rights I think we
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
consistently as an organization have
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
been relatively bipartisan in the sense
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure that children
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
also have rights and also have the
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
ability to speak out especially under
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they might not have
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
a particular where they might not feel
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
safe so generally speaking anything that
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
we will speak out against will come from
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
question I understand your advocation
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
for the for the children but if I recall
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
correctly in reading the annual report
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
it it talked in a negative way against
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
the parents Bill of Rights would it be
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh amendable to you for me I from the
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
report I don't know exactly what you're
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
referencing could I go back to that and
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
then get back to you on that that would
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
be fine that' be okay representative
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
torki I was just going to clarify that
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights is not state law parental
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights is not law so if the
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
organization took a stand on a piece of
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that did not actually get
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
signed into law I don't
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
know why that's something we need to dig
 
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.549 align:start position:0%
know why that's something we need to dig
into

00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
but I'm I I I think there's so much
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
experience at this table I'm just going
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
to share my reaction to to this issue
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
and and invite people to offer a
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
different view or to correct me but um
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
but I would think that in sort of the uh
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
funding of our programs uh we need to
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
pay attention to whether or not we can
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
get the services at the right value and
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
the right quality and so we're we need
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
to take a look at all these things from
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
a a service capability and that any um
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
advocacy that they do on bills uh it is
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
basically First Amendment cover
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
and they are free to take a position on
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
a bill as they as they see fit within
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and and and then I I would be I
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable uh uh withholding um money
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
over an
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
entity's uh
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
activism or advocacy that that's me does
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
does anyone see it differently um
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative I justess uh have some of
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
the same issues that representative
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
Daniels had and maybe to build on that I
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
would in order to move this forward I
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
would think that I'd like the
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity with a passage of some time
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
for you know to the uh rather than doing
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
a recommendation uh to the committee
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
that we allow ourselves the time to
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
discuss it more at the full committee
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
level that I mean that would be my
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion because I still some of the
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
some of the things that are happening
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
are happening with enough speed that
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
that'll allow us some time to clarify
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
where things where things uh stand so
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
that would be my view I think allowing
 
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
oursel additional time to look at this
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
in view of if I could comment on the
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
time element sure um I think we have to
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
make investments because time is one of
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
our scarcest resources at this point we
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
have uh the budget that's been delivered
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
to us we have uh billions literally
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars that we have to
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
decide on in a very short amount of time
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
and I I I just assume not recycle issues
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we can just figure out where to place
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
it and and move on that that would be my
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
preference well I wouldn't consider it
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
recycling I would consider it you know
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
prudent additional consideration I well
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
that's more that's more representa
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
seaworth uh thank you Mr chairman is a
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
question for you I'm new to this
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
process uh it would be my understanding
 
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose of putting this bill or any
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
other large appro Appropriations bill
 
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.350 align:start position:0%
other large appro Appropriations bill
into

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
hb2 is not to say let let's just fund it
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's to have the discussion again in the
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
context of the entire budget so in
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
seconding the motion I wasn't saying
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
let's let's make it
 
00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.039 align:start position:0%
hb2 and and that's it it's to continue
 
00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.190 align:start position:0%
hb2 and and that's it it's to continue
that

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
discussion and and make the right
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
decisions when it comes time to actually
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
vote on the entirety of hb2 so so for a
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
new member of the committee I think you
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
just said it exactly right yeah the
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative priest did
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
you yes um again um when we heard
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
testimony from the attorney from
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS any person that enters into a
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
contract with them signs an agreement
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
that they abide by all federal and state
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
statutes and they sign that so I think
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
way um Waypoint would also do the same
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
so I think uh the concerns that
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels and others have
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
had uh does not exist because I think
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
they would be in compliance with it and
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
work toward that
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
so I think the implication of what you
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
just said is should we pass a parental
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights then based on the
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
standard terms and conditions that
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
Waypoint would sign they would then be
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
obligated to respect the patient bill or
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
or the parent Bill rights I hope I said
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
parent Bill rights but correct okay so
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
so what what how would you like to
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
resolve this representative I just want
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
one more question is the money that
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
you're you're seeking the only part of
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
money that would be coming from the from
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
government that does not include other
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
services such as Medicaid Medicare that
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
we would provide those Services yes this
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
is this is separate so representative
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards had asked for different line
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
budget line items from us and that is
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
something that we're putting together
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
and will be able to provide for the
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you I I think I referred
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
to them as lines of business or line
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so however you do your internal
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
accounting and um it'd be great
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely so so do you do you want to
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
have us proceed with I I mean maybe we
 
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
could entertain a motion just to take
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the material of 519 and place it in hb2
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
for further discussion and review of uh
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
budget allocation I'm fine with that do
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
I would move that we take the content of
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
519 and place it in House Bill 2 for
 
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.430 align:start position:0%
519 and place it in House Bill 2 for
further

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
second you you second do you have a
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
question or is that a second it's a
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
question okay that okay um you didn't in
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
your motion you didn't use the word
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
retain we're not there yet I I I'm
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
explicitly splitting these steps up so
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we know where 519 there'll be
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
another motion just because I think
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
think technically that's probably the
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
what we need to do okay thank
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
you so is there a second
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
to I'll second the motion to move this
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
on okay so we'll we'll do this on a show
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
of hands if you're in favor of taking
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
the language or recommending to finance
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
I guess is what how we have to fa phrase
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
this recommending to finance that we
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
take the material of 519 and place it in
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
hb9 uh hb2 for further discussion
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh raise your
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
hand okay I don't see any opposed so so
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
now I need a second motion to recommend
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
to finance that we will retain HP
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
519 uh represent tki is there a second
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead tki rep representative seaworth
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay again with the show of hands if
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of retaining
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
recommending retaining raise your hand
 
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so that's that okay
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
so is there anyone here to introduce uh
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
hp71 I'm I'm not seeing anyone in the in
 
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.110 align:start position:0%
hp71 I'm I'm not seeing anyone in the in
the

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:20.230 align:start position:0%
the
audience

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
um so um representative
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
Stringham are you able to just introduce
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
the bill you don't have to say anything
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
about it but I I think we we're supposed
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
to have it formally introduced to the
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
committee you will you you could do it
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
from there just if I could since this is
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
a work session and there's already been
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
a public Hearing in the policy committee
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
prior to this you don't actually need an
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
introduction if you don't want one all
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
right no we don't need
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
one okay so
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
um so because uh we haven't really began
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
to talk about hp71 at all uh as a as a
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
as a division um this is I'm going a
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
little out of order because we know more
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
amount about my proposed amendment than
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
we do the bill at this point so so if uh
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to opt for us to talk about
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment to
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
71 and um do does everyone have a copy
 
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.230 align:start position:0%
71 and um do does everyone have a copy
of

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
that okay so this is the non- gerine
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that we talked about in full
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
Finance the other day but it's been
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
revised given the um input that was
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
received there from Dartmouth the
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
hospital Association members of the full
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
finance committee and others to where uh
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
this is um is a repositioning of the of
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
the non-gain amendment in a way that uh
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
should should satisfy the concerns I
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
think I
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
heard uh what it does is it it just
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
takes in the terms and conditions that
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
the um uh Department uses to contract
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
with vendors uh there's already a
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
section and there section
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
61 um uh that that that requires
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with all the civil rights
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
laws and and so so what I think they
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
would do with lines 10 through 12 is to
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
insert into those standard terms and
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
conditions um the requirement to also
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
comply with the patient Bill of Rights
 
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
by citing the RSA
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
number so so it's it's it's not a big
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
deal it's just another comma and asking
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
them to comply with the part of our law
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
that is also intended to enhance our
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
civil rights position positions that's
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
let let me finish with the whole thing
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay um and
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
then uh you'll see on line 13 and 14 a a
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
repeal of what we just put
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
in uh with an effective date of November
 
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.830 align:start position:0%
in uh with an effective date of November
30

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
2026 now now why am i setting this up on
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a 2-year life cycle and then it
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
gets removed from law it's because in
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
you know in my bureaucratic experience
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
you you don't want to Orphan legal
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirements uh in pity you you know at
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
some point this will become part of the
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
culture part of what we do and it'll
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
just happen naturally without requiring
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
a law any longer and then so as a result
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
let's just withdraw the law after it
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
becomes a clear part of the culture and
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
is already embedded in the in the terms
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
and conditions I don't imagine anyone
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
would remove it from the terms and
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
conditions when this sun sets it's just
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
that it's one less check mark that some
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat has to keep track of for
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
compliance so that that's why there's a
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
repeal in there and then so um so that's
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
really what this non gerain Amendment
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
does with its
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment um so so I would I would move
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
that we we we go ahead and pass h B7 uh
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment to hp71 20
 
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.470 align:start position:0%
this amendment to hp71 20
25-

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
25-
 
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.029 align:start position:0%
25-
0416

00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
0416
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hotel uh to supplement hp71 and we're
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
still going to talk about hp71 we may
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
not want to do any of hp71 but that will
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
at least be the shell for this amendment
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's my motion is is there a
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
second yeah um Can is there any can we
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
have some discussion on the on the
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
resulting Amendment here I yes I think I
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
think that comes after um oh so you just
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
want a motion to consider it not to
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
accept it okay right and and then we'll
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
open it for discussion is there is there
 
00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:11.629 align:start position:0%
open it for discussion is there is there
a

00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
second uh
 
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
seconded okay so now we can get into the
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%

amendment um are there any questions for
the

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%

you Mr Williams appreciate it okay so is
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
there any uh further discussion about
 
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.150 align:start position:0%
there any uh further discussion about
the

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.349 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
amendment M Mr Ripple you you you you
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
you tried to tackle me earlier what what
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
did I miss I just wanted to point out
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
from a process perspective I don't want
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
to speak for the house clerk but I think
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
because this amendment is although it's
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
similar to the previous Amendment
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
because it's being attached to a
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
different bill it would require another
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
non- gerain public Hearing in the P
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
finance committee before it could be
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
I think that's what is the probability
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
of you being right I I think in this
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
High all right can ask a question yes Mr
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
Ripple I know that we've been known to
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
do some quick physical posting of
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
hearings is there any way we can squeeze
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
it in for Tuesday when the full finance
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
committee meets I will check and see if
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
that okay let's do that if we can I this
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just we're just spending more time
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
on this than I had hoped but but it's
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
getting better hi do do do you have a
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
comment from the uh
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
Community yeah please and then restate
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
Bill hello my name's Mary Rose De and um
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
I support the amendment uh regarding the
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights to be added um I
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
also um have had experience with this uh
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
hope and
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
prayer um apparently it's some kind of
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
law that is uh has religious
 
00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.190 align:start position:0%
law that is uh has religious
discrimination

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
overtones where they force somebody to
 
00:37:22.359 --> 00:37:24.109 align:start position:0%
overtones where they force somebody to
be

00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess in in um
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
well like a involuntarily committed in
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
hopes that they find God or something
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
like that and the the bill itself is may
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
may I ask you to keep your remarks
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to the amendment before
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
well I I think it's a good idea to have
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
a patient's Bill of Rights um
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
stated clearly in in the um Bill okay
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you you're
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
welcome all right so I'll change my
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
motion I I I I don't even know that we
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
need a motion on this but um but in case
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
we do I I just think that uh the motion
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to take this
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
amendment as is to the full finance
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee to have another hearing on
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
this as a non- gerine Amendment with the
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
idea that uh we'll attach it to hp71 and
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
whatever form hp71 is by the time it
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
leaves full Finance
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
it's a long motion anyone car a second
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
that was that was the restatement am I
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
seconding you or making that motion
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
myself you're seconding great I second
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
okay all right so uh do you have more
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative priest yes I
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
just want to commend you um for this
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it really clarifies it
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
and um and brings in the realities of
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
what D HHS is doing with their cont
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
contacting well thank you I think it's a
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
testimony to the genius of the process
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know I I just happen to be bumbling
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
along at the time and got got guided
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
properly so so thank you representative
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
Stringham yeah I would like to thank you
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
as well for the um uh uh movement of of
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment but I I want kind of have
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
a kind of a little bit of a comment
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
about uh the discussion we had because
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
um um you know I I think I'm suffering a
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
little bit from postco stress disorder
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
instead of PTSD
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
pcsd um and um you know so when that
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
discussion happens you know we were
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
talking about a specific uh case at uh
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth Hitchcock which is not only
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
a great hospital for New Hampshire but
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's a great hospital for the country
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
and I have a high level of trust in the
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
medical professionals there I think um I
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
I I think when they come in and they
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
know they're getting measured on the
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes that they deliver for patients
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
that uh do things like uh get a
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
transplant other major procedures
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
they're required to establish protocols
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
for best
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes and uh you so they're measured
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
on these success rates and to the point
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
where the amount they get paid is based
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
on their quality scores and things
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
things like uh uh how many of these
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
patients have failures so um um you know
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
if if they've come up as part of the
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
protocol they require a series of
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
diagnostic tests or weight loss or o
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
other other things that may uh delay or
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
um when a patient would get a particular
 
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.309 align:start position:0%
um when a patient would get a particular
treatment

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
um you know I trust that they've done it
 
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of trying to look
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
out for the entire Health Care system as
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
well as the wealth for the patient
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
and um and you know I mentioned this P
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
pcsd or postco so when I see an
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly strong
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
reaction uh to to to me it seemed seemed
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
um uh substantial to an issue of
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
requiring masks or public health
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
officials being
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
criticized or or vaccines being a good
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
idea for a particular group you know I I
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
react probably a little more strongly
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
than I should and I do think that you
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
know use using the phrase this was an
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
egregious violation of the patient Bill
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
of Rights that's kind of what got me
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
started feeling a little more anxious
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
about this discussion and and that
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment so okay um thank you for the
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
reminder um uh it was my intent coming
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
into this to publicly restate my
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
overstatement of what happened at
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth I had an opportunity to get
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
additional information I I I don't think
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that what happened to this particular
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
patient was uh intended to be systemic I
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
think it was a one-off that as it got
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
escalated through their chain of command
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
their leadership got involved pretty
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
quickly tried to understand it and
 
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
resolve it and uh and and and so uh uh I
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
I I I spoke more strongly than I ought
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
to have given that I didn't have a 360
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
degree view of everyone's perspective
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
but but since I've become U more
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
informed I I realize in hindsight that
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
my use of the word egregious was
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
excessive and so I would just simply say
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
this was a an oops that that they they
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
they intended to respect the Bill of
 
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
they intended to respect the Bill of
Rights

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
and uh it didn't happen there was a real
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
instance where it didn't happen um but
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh that it wasn't intentional or
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
systemic it just was the way it happens
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the real world where everything's
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
complex um ju and also to I think the
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
other implied point that you have is
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
that um in the terms and
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
conditions uh on the vaccine status it
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
it it clearly says in there that um uh
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
healthc care can't be uh limited solely
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
based on vaccine status and so vaccine
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
status would I think to your other point
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
about weight loss and other things would
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
be a variable in an overall holistic
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
view of whether or not the patient would
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
likely benefit from the procedures so so
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think and given that Dartmouth
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
is okay with this I I I think this
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
leaves them with the professional
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
discretion that they're entitled
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
to well thank you thank you very much
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
for that clarification and those
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
comments and it's consistent with uh
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
every other circumstances that I've
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
dealt with you over the last six years
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
that um that you're you're very
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and and moving forward I know
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
we're all we're all very grateful that
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
uh the patient uh that was concerned
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
about access to care
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh which was being uh potentially
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
offered him just before Christmas has
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
now been fully resolved and six weeks
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
later which um uh while I'm sure feels
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
like a long time that's pretty pretty
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
responsive for the Health Care system
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we have uh so um and once once
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
again I thank you for uh I I think we
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
all want to see uh the patients Bill of
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
Rights uh uh being effectively
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
implemented and and and I think the way
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
that you've written in to be included in
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
contracts is something I can certainly
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
support well thank you and and Mr hodal
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
a shout out to you uh if you would just
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh take back to your
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
leadership uh my my public apology uh
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's uh sincere I got uh I I I got a
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
little emotionally invested in patient
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
care which is where I grew up so uh Mr
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you as you and I discussed
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that uh that was necessary
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
but I will say that the the tenor and
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
the thoughtfulness of this conversation
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
is um something that I'm glad to be here
 
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
in person to have been part of and
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
witness thank you all right thank you
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
okay so where were we we're in the
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
discussion I think of a very long motion
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
do you have more to say representative
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
furki we I'm I'm I'm just trying to
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
forgot I made a motion yeah I I think
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
what I think what we're doing is we're
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
just trying to go ahead and take this
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
non gerain Amendment uh and since we're
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
attaching it to 71 instead of 519 we
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
have to go to full Finance to say this
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
is under the other Bill yes so I know in
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
past meetings that we've had sometimes
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
we will have sort of a
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
non-binding vote let's say you have used
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
the word straw pole um maybe we could
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
just so we can keep a record of our
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussions a um I'd say make a motion
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
for a straw poll that we will be
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
amending House Bill 71 with your
 
00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment um just so we're all clear on
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
where we got to this place I don't even
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
know if that's a legit question to ask
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
anything that moves us forward at this
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
point I I have you got an opinion Mr
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
Ripple on whether or not we can add this
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
to the calendar and have the non gerain
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on what next Finance meeting I
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back yet um but I I
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
believe House Bill 71 isn't even on the
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
calendar for Tuesday's meeting now non
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
main Amendment or not um so yeah I've
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
checked with the clerk I'll let you know
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
what I find out okay so to your straw
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
pole can we straw pull it to say that we
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
want to do the proper house procedure
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
and we want to keep moving this non
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
gerain Amendment with the intent of
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
attaching it to 71 whatever 71 looks
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
like in the
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
future all right all in favor of
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
that all right thank
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
um so now I think um we're on hp71 FN
 
00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:40.839 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't see uh any of the
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
representatives that sponsored this bill
 
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.349 align:start position:0%
representatives that sponsored this bill
uh

00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
present um so I uh I I I I kind of
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
always look forward to hearing what the
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
people who heard this in the policy
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
committee U heard on this um I think as
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
I've picked up uh more Grapevine than
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
officially is that uh the I the idea of
 
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.150 align:start position:0%
officially is that uh the I the idea of
the

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
proponents was that this bill would uh
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
protect the facilities of our
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
educational system so that they can uh
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the future be uh dedicated to their
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
core function of educating students and
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
I think uh the opponents uh were
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
concerned that uh with this in place it
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
could jeopardize funding from the
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
federal government if we aren't uh
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
complying with I guess shelter
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh refugees and other
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
authorized immigrants so I I think
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's the setup for the pro and con um
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
and um so we can begin discussion on it
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh I I I the the the motion that brought
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
or the what happened is it passed on a
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
Partyline vote out of the committee it
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
got to the floor I think that was
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
essentially a Partyline vote uh here I I
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
don't know where we stand on it but uh
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a motion to
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
OTP otpa maybe um hp71 and then we would
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
have a discussion on that
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have a work session which is
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
what this is supposed to be and um
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill itself there's no one
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
here but go Mr Williams is anyone from
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
the Department that could discuss no
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
well we have education here were you
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
71 well but sorry thank you my concern
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
is the fiscal note and um I'm assuming
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
that the potential loss of federal
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
revenue is to a department in DHHS which
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
is what I wanted some discussion on I
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
mean 12 to18 million is a lot of
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
money well okay so we get a little
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
you're right and we have conflicting
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
stuff the grid says zeros and the words
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
say worst case and so um you
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
know I I think there's a judgment in in
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I sorry no the fact that this was
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
this was is posted as a work session I
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
thought that we would have discussion on
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
the bill am I misunderstanding we we we
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
can but nobody showed up to discuss it
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's are you are you prepared to like
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
tell us what you think from a
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective Mr Williams if
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
please okay chairman Edwards and
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
represent toori thank you very much for
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
the question my apologies I was here
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
today prepared to discuss the amendment
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
that you had already acted on uh with
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
this committee I wasn't here prepared to
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
talk on hp71 I did however try to pull
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
up the bill on the website and
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
regrettably the general court website is
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
down so unless Mr Ripple has some
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
additional information that he could
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee uh otherwise I
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
could certainly follow up with questions
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
do would you state your name for the
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
record yes good morning my name is Diana
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and right now
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just offering technical assistance
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
to uh John Williams to because I was
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
able to get the bill online oh and I
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
think he's just reviewing the fiscal
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
note and the fiscal impact that you had
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
so in the absence of a question you
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't really have anything to add
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
regarding this
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
bill you didn't intend to add anything
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
like all good lawyers I'll I'll say it
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
it depends yeah um but no the Department
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
of Education is here obviously to offer
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
any technical assistance but when we
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
look at this bill um as previously noted
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact they reached out to
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
both agencies
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
um Department of Education Department of
 
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the department
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
of education's position was that it
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
would not have any fiscal impact on our
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
agency or the local entities um DHHS did
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal impact I believe that is
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
what the representative was referencing
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
in her previous comment so I think I
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
have bought uh attorney Williams enough
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
time at this point so I'm going to
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
graciously hand it over so Mr Williams a
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
specific question do uh as this fiscal
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
note was developed um do you know uh how
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
the 12 to 18 million figure uh was
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
determined and and what the confidence
 
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
level of that estimate or worst case
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
scenario is I mean what's the background
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
well I first off I want to thank
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
attorney Diana Fenton for her assistance
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
because obviously her computer was
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
working better than mine to getting the
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill up um I am involved with the
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
processing of all of our fiscal analysis
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
on legislation working along with Nathan
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
white and his team and now that I saw
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
the reference that is stated in the
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it it did refresh my
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
recollection uh we we spent the time uh
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
when I referred the bill out to the
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity we realized this
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
cut across various programmatic areas
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
within the department including Medicaid
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
and other areas so we did generate uh a
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
request from the other program areas to
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not there would be
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
any of the federal funds that may be at
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
risk and I do have to emphasize the word
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
may not shall was used in the uh fiscal
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
analysis so we felt it was important to
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
bring to the attention of the
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
legislature through the um um
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
legislative budget Assistance office
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
that there was the potential brisk of
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
these these federal dollars uh any
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
greater level of detail I would have to
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
take it back uh but I do have a
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
recollection of how we arrived at this
 
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
sum so Mr Ripple an LBA question do do
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
you have any context or background on
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
the development of this fiscal note uh
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
not very much so I'm looking at what the
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
department sent us right now and I'll
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
just say upfront I think the zeros at
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
the top should have said indeterminable
 
00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
instead um in the body of the bill I do
 
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
think the phrase worst case scenario is
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it's unknown at this
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
time whether there actually will be any
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
impact whether there would be any impact
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
to Federal funding if this bill were to
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
pass um that would would would it imply
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
that the best case is it would have no
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
Financial impact at all I think that
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
would be the best case yes um looking at
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
the Department's response to us there's
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
a paragraph here that references federal
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
funds through the office of refugee
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
resettlement and the Department of
 
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development and it
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
reads considering prior Grant awards
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
from both of these entities the
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
potential loss of federal revenue ranges
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
from 12 to 18 million so that's the only
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
detail we have at this
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
point I'm sorry I I drifted could you
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
say that last two sentences
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
again uh so this response from HHS
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
references funds received through the
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
office of refugee resettlement and the
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
Development uh which do not require
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
citizenship documentation uh so it says
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
considering prior Grant awards from both
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
of those entities the potential loss of
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
federal revenue ranges from 12 to $18
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
million but they didn't tie that loss
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
specifically to housing them somewhere
 
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
other than public schools I mean we have
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
to house them not in this document I
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
don't know what the Department's backup
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
is for this document right I mean I'm
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
just I'm just thinking Mr Williams that
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
if we refuse to house them then we could
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
be subject to losing the grant but that
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
we don't get demands by the federal
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
government on where to house them they
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say put them in your schools or
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
we won't pay
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
you I believe that's a fair assessment
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards all right than
 
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%

00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%

back to you with greater detail on on
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%

00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
language in the bill it does Define uh
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
specifically what they're referring to
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
section it's shelter housing definition
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
yeah under the shelter and housing
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
definition found
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
on line five through six and it goes all
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
so so the key one seems to be coming in
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
around line 17 because the ones the
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
commas are I think fairly clear right
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
that we're saying that uh no no
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
no that if a public school a chartered
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
public school and a public Academy if
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
they were to
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
receive I don't actually know what that
 
00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:57.309 align:start position:0%
receive I don't actually know what that
means

00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
okay um so I think what we ought to do
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple is uh is this is not on the
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
isn't I I I I think we need to do
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
another division 3 work session and
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
invite more expert testimony that's gone
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
over this and and maybe I can find it on
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
the YouTube um cuz you know you know we
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's probably all been said and we just
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
haven't listened to it
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
yet so so let's do when when's our next
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
when do we think we're going to have
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
another division 3 uh session when the
 
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.230 align:start position:0%
another division 3 uh session when the
commissioner

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
comes so yes you have a budget work
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
session on Tuesday and Wednesday of next
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
week um I'll see if I can add something
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
to one of those days actually you have
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Wednesday and Friday of next
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
week Friday's yet to be scheduled
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
okay so so whatever works best with
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
getting it into the calendar without
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
breaking things I I I don't care which
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
one that goes in but just let me know
 
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:09.799 align:start position:0%
and and then we'll invite uh the
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
sponsors if uh in in maybe the right
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
departments yeah representa Mooney thank
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Mr Ripple with regards
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
to this methodology and I'm glad Mr
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
William emphasized the word may that's
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
the key word here in this
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph um potential worst case
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
scenario loss 12 to 18 million just for
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
our reference going forward and this
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
will come up again and we will get a
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
hard copy of the governor's proposed
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
budget this afternoon could you give us
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
a precise location in the proposed
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
budget accounting unit and all as to
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
where this would be effect this would
 
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.670 align:start position:0%
where this would be effect this would
take

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
effect I will ask the department to
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
provide that information yes that would
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
be extremely helpful for our next
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
discussion okay so so we're going to
 
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
kick this can down the road and try to
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
get the right people in the room
 
01:00:14.839 --> 01:00:16.710 align:start position:0%
get the right people in the room
okay

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
um so it's not a motion but that's my
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
intent is that we're going to go ahead
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
and reschedule this and invite some
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
people that can take our questions and
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
Prov more detail is there any opposition
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
to that I have no opposition uh I just
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
say I I do think we have to understand
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be a financial
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
impact of implementing this and uh I
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
concur with um doing what we need to do
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be able to vote on the
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
all right my my instinct on this is that
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
it's there is no Financial impact it's
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's worst case scenarios which I
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
don't consider very practic
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh and uh given the way this bill has
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
been moved so far on partisan lines I'm
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
not really
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
expecting anything different but I we'll
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
see we'll see all right so um I'm show a
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
road all right we uh that's good so
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's it I think uh if there's anything
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
else to add to today's session I have a
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
quick question uh representative tersi I
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um Mr Ripple just so we
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
for planning purposes since uh the house
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
calendar yet does not have that Friday
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
schedule um Mr chairman we're looking at
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Morning is full finance and then
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
the afternoon is division three cor
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is all day division three
 
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.589 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is all day division three
and

01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
Friday you would have Friday afternoon
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
at 1 p.m. when the division of Medicaid
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
services which I have to tell you I
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
won't be here that Friday I I will be
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
traveling to a wedding in DC and then I
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
am moving to uh my new home in Arizona
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh for the week to get it ready for
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
renters so I'm not going to be here for
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
about 10 days so I I just assume do this
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday if we can
 
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't think hb2 is going to be
 
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
ready and and that's the biggest block
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
of time on Tuesday commissioner and hp2
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
I don't think hp2 is going to happen um
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
there may be a draft of it available
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
there won't be a formal document
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
introduced by OSS at that point but um
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but you can add this to the
 
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday discussion for sure I think
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
there'll be time for that all right
 
01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:54.039 align:start position:0%
let's do that yes just quick question um
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear you're going to have
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
some time are or will we be continuing
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
work under representative Mooney week
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
the vice chair great is the chair in the
 
01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
absence of the chair she runs a great
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%

01:03:09.079 --> 01:03:11.630 align:start position:0%

questions

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
though all right um any other discussion
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
on 71 or any business that we've
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
conducted today or any business we want
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
