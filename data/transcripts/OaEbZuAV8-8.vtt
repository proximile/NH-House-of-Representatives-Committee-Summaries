00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
testing testing I guess everything works
 
00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
this is your one minute warning our
 
00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everyone and welcome
 
00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
January what is today the 17th Tuesday
 
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
the 17th of January 2023 welcome to
 
00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy
 
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'll go over our agenda in just a minute
 
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
but first I'd ask you all to rise and
 
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
join representative Noel who will lead
 
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and uh as I mentioned
 
00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
earlier we have a full agenda today
 
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the afternoon
 
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to start with a presentation
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Environmental
 
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
Services between now and roughly noon
 
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
whenever they get done
 
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
and then we'll break for lunch
 
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
after that we'll come back at 1 pm for a
 
00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
presentation by The Joint utilities
 
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's eversource Liberty and Unitil
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
and that will be followed at 3 pm by a
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
presentation by the New Hampshire
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll just remind members of the
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
committee that we will also be meeting
 
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
on January 19th which is Thursday
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
however there's a little bit of a
 
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
wrinkle there
 
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
last Wednesday the government relations
 
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
officer for ISO New England who is our
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
first presenter of the day
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
contracted covid
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
and as of
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
Sunday he was still testing positive
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
so unless he gets a negative test today
 
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
we probably will have to postpone our
 
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
ISO New England presentation on Thursday
 
00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
and since there's only one other
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
presentation that day which is the New
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
England power generators Association
 
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
we're probably postpone both of those
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
presentations till later on
 
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's going to be problematic because
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
on Monday January 23rd
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
puc is coming in in the morning but then
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to have Bill hearings in the
 
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
we're going to have Bill hearings in the
afternoon

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
and then on Tuesday January 24th
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
the Community power Coalition of New
 
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is coming in for a
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
presentation first thing in the morning
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
but then we're having Bill hearings
 
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 align:start position:0%
later in the day and we're even having
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
an exec session
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
that afternoon
 
00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.749 align:start position:0%
that afternoon
so

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
rescheduling the iso New England and New
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
England power generators uh
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
presentations is going to be problematic
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
because we've already mapped out a bill
 
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
schedule the bill hearing schedule
 
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
that is pretty full for the month of
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
February so we'll have to see what
 
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.610 align:start position:0%
February so we'll have to see what
happens

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
with that said I'd like to welcome now
 
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 align:start position:0%
and ask them to present to the committee
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
and say good morning to commissioner
 
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
Robert Scott good morning
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thanks for having us uh
 
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you're aware most of the
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
presentation today will be from the air
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
Resources Division but I I wanted to
 
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 align:start position:0%
basically make a cameo and I brought
 
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
some of our department leadership just
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
if nothing else so you could see their
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
face uh and I wanted to make myself
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
available for questions any questions
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
also so again uh for the record my name
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
is Bob Scott I'm commissioner for the
 
00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I've been in
 
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
state government for 26 years so I've uh
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know as Mark and I joke behind me I
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
can't keep a job so I've had many jobs
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
within state government but my current
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
one is this commissioner here at one
 
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
point I was a division director as
 
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
director Wright has so he can blame me
 
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
for any any any uh past issues with with
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
the the division so uh with that if I
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
could I'd like to behind me I have our
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
assistant uh commissioner uh Mark
 
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.590 align:start position:0%
assistant uh commissioner uh Mark
Sanborn

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
Sanborn
 
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
and uh our Waste Management director uh
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
as well as our Water Division uh
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
so so uh quickly so for the Department
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea obviously their
 
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
resource division is is an important
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
part of what we do uh of late some of
 
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
our our
 
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
things that have been taking a lot of
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
our time are we have large amounts of
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money for water and
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
wastewater between arpa
 
00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
we received 185 million of State the
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
state portion of that for water
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and Dam infrastructure uh the
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
infrastructure act the the bill act is
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
moving a lot of money in the next five
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
years for water and wastewater uh
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we're kind of picking
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
apart now the uh Ira the inflation
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
reduction act to see if there's any uh
 
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
venues there but I don't I don't think
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
for water infrastructure uh necessarily
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that's taking up a lot of our time
 
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.230 align:start position:0%
so that's taking up a lot of our time
also

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
um water contamination uh in emerging
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
contaminants is this as science improves
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
and we're able to measure things we're
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
finding more things so that's those two
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
things are probably taking up the
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
majority of my time uh just for general
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
interest uh I also I mentioned I have
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
worn a lot of hats in the past the other
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
hat I wear is I'm the governor's cyber
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
security advisor for critical
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so I spend a fair amount
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
of time on that that work also
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
so with that if there's any questions if
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
not I'll
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to answer any
 
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:04.460 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
my question uh since you mentioned Water
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and Wastewater and since um we know that
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the state our
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
Water Systems particularly this the
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
sewer systems are woefully Antiquated uh
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
what what programs are like like the top
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
three programs that that would that
 
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
would be useful useful for the monies
 
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
that we you know just
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
just received what do they plan for that
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
sure so we have multiple pots of money
 
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
for uh water uh drinking water and clean
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
water which is Wastewater we have the
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
state revolving Loan Fund program which
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
has been long-standing uh that's being
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
plused up significantly with the
 
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill so that'll be the
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
venue for most of the funds for what's
 
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:51.500 align:start position:0%
called disadvantaged communities
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
which we have a definition of uh which
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
is basically primarily based on medium
 
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
household income but also if you have a
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
lot of water contamination those systems
 
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019 align:start position:0%
can can qualify for up to 50 loan
 
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
forgiveness so that's our primary with
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
the 185 million I mentioned in arpa
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
those are all grants most of those have
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
been already offered we we did multiple
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
programs with with that for both Water
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
and Wastewater including planning Asset
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
Management uh and then just just plain
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh jobs jobs gives me
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
projects where we took took the srf
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
applications and we match them and
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically we were in a mode which is
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
very nice to be is
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
we did offer letters to the community
 
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.550 align:start position:0%
we did offer letters to the community
saying

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh congratulations you applied for x
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
amount of money for infrastructure loans
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
we've got to give you slightly less
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
because we're giving you that much in
 
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
Grants and now the rest is in in loans
 
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
so we're at that mode now for arpa we
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
have a little bit left but but not not
 
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.570 align:start position:0%
have a little bit left but but not not
much

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:01.580 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
we also have for drinking water systems
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
not Wastewater systems we have the the
 
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
groundwater drink the drinking water
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund uh in that on a
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
yearly bet and I'm on the commission for
 
00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
yearly bet and I'm on the commission for
that

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
um one of the the Commissioners for that
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis we typically give up
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 25 million dollars uh for
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water projects a combination of
 
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
loan and grants also so those are some
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
of our primary uh pro programs if you
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
have a constituent that's interested
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
certainly they can call me but uh if you
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
go to our website we have a very good
 
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
website that articulates all of that and
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
and directs you where to go to to find
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
those things so I would recommend just
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
Googling Des infrastructure and you'll
 
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
find that website
 
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.250 align:start position:0%
find that website

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
question as well thank you very much Mr
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here
 
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
um you've talked about air and water can
 
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:02.579 align:start position:0%
you tell me what division soil comes
 
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.710 align:start position:0%
you tell me what division soil comes
under

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.090 align:start position:0%
under
uh

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
sorry for the speakers right between the
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative and myself uh
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
so if it if it's soils management like
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh biosolids that type of thing it's in
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
the Water Division
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
I'm taking more of soil contamination uh
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
then it'd be the waste management
 
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions you can
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
move right along thank you
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
Craig Wright I serve as the air
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
Resources Division director
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh we did plan today to have Mike
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald here as well he's a very
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
frequent flyer before this committee
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
he unfortunately fell ill this weekend
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
and can't join us but I do want to
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
introduce a couple of my staff that are
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
here to my right is Becky ohler she's
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
the administrator of our Technical
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau
 
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
behind me on this side is Joe Fontaine
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
and also Phil lamoreaux who is
 
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
relatively new to the division but a a
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
rising up-and-comer in the division so
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
so we handed out uh our first
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
presentation today you should all have
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we're also going to do a Reggie
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
presentation and when I'm done so I'll
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
tell uh I think we'll take less than an
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
hour and now we'll leave plenty of time
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
for questions that's that's the fun part
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
in my opinion anyway so
 
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.850 align:start position:0%
in my opinion anyway so
laughs

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that advances so the air
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
Resources Division consists of three
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
bureaus I'm not going to walk through
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
these bureaus because my latest slides
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'll hit on some of the responsibilities
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
for each one of those bureaus but also
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
we have a director's office that's
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
obviously for division oversight
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
budgeting management policy decisions
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
those types of things but we also have a
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
technical group in the year in the uh
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
director's office and that's our
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
atmospheric sciences unit that was
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
formerly had by Dr Jeff Underhill but he
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
recently retired
 
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.970 align:start position:0%
recently retired
mm-hmm

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
so here's just a list of our senior
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
staff including myself and Mike
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald's phone numbers feel free to
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
reach out to any one of these folks
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a question but always
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
the buck stops with Mike and I so feel
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
free to reach to us first if you feel so
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
inclined we have a pretty
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
seasoned staff for managing the division
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
I did mention Dr Underhill he retired he
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
that's the vacancy listed there in the
 
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
atmospheric science unit
 
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
atmospheric science unit
foreign

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
three four
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
so in addition to implementing state
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
laws the air Resources Division is uh
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
implements the vast majority of the
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
federal Clean Air Act a lot what of what
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
we do comes out of the Clean Air Act
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
uh some of those major things are
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
monitoring air quality across the state
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
to ensure compliance with the federal
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
air quality standards which sets a Level
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
Playing Field across the country EPA
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
establishes the standards but it's up to
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
states to measure and monitor and make
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
sure that we maintain the standards
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
in terms of those standards we have to
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement enforce and
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
control strategies to meet the federal
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
air quality standards we issue all Air
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
permits in New Hampshire whether it's a
 
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
state permit or a federal permit under
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act we're a fully
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
delegated state so permanent sources can
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
deal directly with Des for all Air
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
permits they don't have to go to EPA
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
part of our role is obviously getting
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
out in the field doing compliance
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
inspections uh complaint investigations
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
and enforcement actions enforcements not
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
our preferred course of action we prefer
 
00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
everybody to be in compliance but we
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
will we have tools that we do use and we
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
work through the Des legal office and
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
also on occasion with the attorney
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
terms of Staffing we have 65 full-time
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
positions currently nine of them are
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
vacant that's about a 14 vacancy rate
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that's pretty consistent
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
across state government 15 to 20 percent
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
I think is the number I usually hear
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
terms of the type of Staff we have we
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Engineers uh mechanical
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
chemical civil engineers environmental
 
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
and life science Majors atmospheric
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
science Health Sciences and we have a
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
couple attorneys they're not in legal
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
positions but they are attorneys
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
um one thing I did want to know one of
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
the challenges we're facing as a
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
Division I think this is also across
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
state government is I'm looking at
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
probably nine senior staff retiring in
 
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
all told that it's about 225 years of
 
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
State service and when I was thinking
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
about this morning I think there's
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
actually a tenth one I could add on to
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
um in terms of trying to address that
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
we've been working on updating a lot of
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
our policies and procedures make sure we
 
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
have good standard operating procedures
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
in place and we're also really out there
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
trying to attract some good young Talent
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
like Phil back here so uh those people
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of where do we get our
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
operating Revenue this chart goes back
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
to FY 10 so this is a 12 years of
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
operating data and you'll see all toll
 
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
we really haven't risen that much in
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
terms of 12 years we've gone from about
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars in Revenue to just
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
a little over eight million dollars
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
um that will that last bar is a little
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
bit higher than normal because some of
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
that deals with the timing of federal
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
money so you can see we're very reliant
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
on permit fees uh permit fees in fact
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
support two of our three bureaus
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
supports the permitting group and also
 
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:39.620 align:start position:0%
our compliance and enforcement Bureau
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's generally close to half of our
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
operating Revenue uh we also receive a
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
significant portion about somewhere
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 30 percent depending on
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
the year federal funds uh Motor Vehicles
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
the largest source of air pollution in
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
the state contribute a small amount to
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
our operating budget and then there's a
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
little bit of general fund money we get
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll hit some of those general
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
always like to point out that
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
maintaining good air quality is
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
important not only for the environment
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
but also the economy one of the things
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
we used to struggle with not so much now
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
was we did not meet certain federal air
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
quality standards therefore we need to
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
develop more and more stringent
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
regulations we've we are currently
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
attainment for all of the national
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
ambient air quality standards that's a
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
good thing now our goal is to maintain
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
and don't put us back into
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
non-attainment Obviously good air
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
quality protects public health and
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
decreases health care costs we know New
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a beautiful state people
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
love to come here to see our mountains
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
swim in our Lakes air quality is
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
important not only for visibility but
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
people love to hike our mountains and
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
some of the worst air quality we have
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes on top of Mount Washington
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
believe it or not so
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
um and it also it really helps good air
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
also helps to maintain the health of our
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
forests and our forests help maintain
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
the quality of our water so it's all
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
interrelated in my mind so we they're
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
all important component to maintaining a
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
healthy state
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the federal Clean Air Act
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
Amendments of 1990
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
the act establishes that EPA established
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
the national ambient air quality
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
standards for six pollutants ozone
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
 
00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:23.419 align:start position:0%
particulate matter lead and Co
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
historically ozone sulfur dioxide and
 
00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:29.690 align:start position:0%
historically ozone sulfur dioxide and
um

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
in particular matter have been our
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
biggest challenges the Clean Air Act
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
also establishes a program called
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
hazardous air pollutants it regulates
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
toxics including Mercury the state of
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does also have a state air
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
toxics program the federal program is a
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
technology-based program where it
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
requires certain levels of controls
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
based on the size of your Source the
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
stadia toxics program is a health-based
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
program where we have ambient air
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
quality standard limits for I think over
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
600 air pollutants so
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
um EPA does review the national ambient
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
air quality standards every five years
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to under the yak
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're a little bit late on
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
that and you'll see a couple charts
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
later on where EPA has made changes to
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
the air quality standards and I can tell
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
you they generally always go down as
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
science gets better and we have a better
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
understanding as to how air pollution
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
I kind of already mentioned this but one
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
of the key components of the ACT is if
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
you don't meet the federal air quality
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
standards you get into what's known as
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
non-attainment that's not good for us as
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
a state from a health standpoint or from
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
a standpoint of having to develop
 
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.549 align:start position:0%
a standpoint of having to develop
regulations

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
um some of the programs that are are
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
required under the federal program are
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
the new source review program this is
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
for new major sources or modifications
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
to existing major sources emissions
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
offsets for certain categories in
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
certain areas
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
um if if we're in non-attainment Motor
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Inspection Transportation
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
Conformity those those are all things
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we didn't invent they all come out
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
of the federal Clean Air Act and there
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
is what's known as a savings clause and
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act Like I said even
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
though we are in attainment with all the
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
federal standards it doesn't mean we get
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
to take the foot off the gas pedal we
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
need to maintain our attainment status
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
and we can't backslide so that's an
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
important part of the ACT
 
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.850 align:start position:0%
important part of the ACT
hmm

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
I mentioned one of our one of our
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
fundamental things that we're required
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
to do Under the ACT is to monitor air
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
quality across the state we have a fully
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
approved uh annual ambient air
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring plan this is a map of where
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
we have our monitors we literally Mount
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
we monitor from the top of Mount
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
Washington to the base of Mount
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
Washington down the Connecticut River
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
Valley across the Southern Tier of the
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
Seacoast and up the almost up the
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River Valley and across in
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
Laconia now we don't monitor for all
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
pollutants at all of these stations we
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
some of them are single pollutant
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
monitoring sites such as Pembroke we
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
only think we monitor to there is sulfur
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
dioxide and that's downwind of the ball
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
power plant so it makes sense to have a
 
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
monitor there
 
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.169 align:start position:0%
monitor there
um

00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington we traditionally Mark
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
to Ozone up there we are now also
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
monitoring Trace Co we do occasionally
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
have stratospheric ozone intrusions not
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
man-made events up there so that Co
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
monitor will help us
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
so here's a here's a picture of a three
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
of our monitoring sites in Londonderry
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Miller State Park Miller
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
State Park is a high level site similar
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
to Mount Washington
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
these sites are we generally construct
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
these sites ourselves and put the
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
equipment in them we um each one of
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
these sites probably has somewhere from
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
150 to half a million dollars worth of
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
equipment that we need to maintain in
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
accordance with Federal uh monitoring
 
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.210 align:start position:0%
accordance with Federal uh monitoring
requirements

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
people often ask me how is the air
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
quality in New Hampshire I've been doing
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
this for 36 years and I can tell you
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
that the air quality today is a lot
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
better than when I started in 1988 a lot
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
of that is a result of the fine work of
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act which is uh some of
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
the largest Federal Environmental
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
legislation and I in my opinion has been
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
very successful
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's also the result of some statutes
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we've passed right here in some
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
cases New Hampshire has led the way for
 
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
cases New Hampshire has led the way for
example

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
the 1990 amendments had a federal acid
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
rain program New Hampshire had a state
 
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:33.539 align:start position:0%
asset rain program prior to the federal
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
program so sometimes we lead the way
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
in terms of General air quality these
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
charts represent the last two or three
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
years worth of data and it measures
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
percent to days the green bar means good
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
the yellow bar means moderate and
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
there's a little tiny bar at the top
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
that says USG that's unhealthy for
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
sensitive groups
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much this is
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the um the air monitoring
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
stations can you tell me if any of them
 
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
specifically measure for pfas in the air
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry measures what
 
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.470 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry measures what
no

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay I don't they're they're the ability
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
to measure uh pfas and ambient air is a
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
significant challenge
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh we have measured pfast like out of
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
Saint Cobain's emission Stacks
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
um that's a very uh technical uh test
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
method it's it's it's set up by EPA but
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
there's nothing right now for ambient
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um could you
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
advance your slide to be the one you
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:50.539 align:start position:0%
is the the green bars and the Red Bar
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah uh this slide and the next one and
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
what you were just talking about is a
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful to see
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
um but New Hampshire of course is
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
a relatively small state correct not an
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
island and we are famously downwind of
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country as the
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
person in charge of air quality in New
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Do you have a
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
is there like a fraction in your mind
 
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.549 align:start position:0%
is there like a fraction in your mind
uh

00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
the extent to which
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
this these great results are the result
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire policies
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
versus policies that have been
 
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.289 align:start position:0%
versus policies that have been
implemented

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
throughout the rest of the country and
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
in other states by virtue of the Clean
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
Air Act so I would I would say it's a
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
combination of course it's a combination
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'm asking um I would say
 
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:46.580 align:start position:0%
as a downwind state we have benefited
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
significantly from the reduction of air
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
pollution from upwind States there's
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
absolutely no doubt about it
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
uh Dr Underhill used to tell me that on
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
a poor air quality day sometimes
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
probably 90 percent plus percent of that
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
pollution came into New Hampshire so it
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
was probably already above the standards
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
before it got here we add an incremental
 
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
amount to that
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
um that's on a general wide scale basis
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
now there are certainly cases for
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
example you could be downwind of a
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
particular source and that particular
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
Source could certainly add a significant
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
portion of what you're breathing locally
 
00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:27.299 align:start position:0%
so does that answer your question
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I'd remind the members to turn their
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
microphones off when they're finished
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
speaking thank you
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just a quick
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
question looking at this
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
um comparison direct comparison how does
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
the air quality in New Hampshire compare
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
to uh directly compared to other states
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
outside of New England
 
00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:51.710 align:start position:0%
outside of New England
generally

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
um I would say Maine New Hampshire and
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
Vermont probably have fairly similar
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
levels of air pollution on most days
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
uh there are some localized situations
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
again uh primarily with like wood smoke
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the winter time
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh the worst air quality in New England
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
is in the Connecticut region uh they're
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're right downwind of New York City
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
the I-95 Corridor uh they continue to
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
struggle with ozone and they continue to
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
not meet the federal air quality
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
standards in Connecticut and New York
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
I guess my question was sorry is how
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
does it compare to States outside of New
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
England oh sorry misunderstood that
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
um it varies across the country there
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
there are local situations that occur
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I would say our air has cleaned up
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
um historically ozone has been our
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
biggest pollutant of concern
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
um I would say as the tailpipe of the
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
city for some pollutants on some days
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're worse than other parts of the
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
countries but I would say most of the
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
time we're as good if not better
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
so there's no ranking system of States
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
plane versus Georgia representative
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
Summers let me interrupt you for a
 
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.769 align:start position:0%
Summers let me interrupt you for a
second

00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
I'd remind members that if you have a
 
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up question you have to ask
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
permission to the chair to ask that
 
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.029 align:start position:0%
permission to the chair to ask that
question

00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
go ahead if you have a follow-up
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up there is repeating the
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
questions sorry is uh
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
um how does there's no ranking system or
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
anything we don't have a ranking system
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
EPA doesn't have a ranking system I'm
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
aware of the American Lung Association
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
does put out an annual report and they
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
they rate all countries all counties in
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
um that report usually comes out I think
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
in the early summer time
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
historically we've gotten
 
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
better and better grades we have on
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
occasion gotten C's D's and even an F
 
00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:50.179 align:start position:0%
once in a while
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
primarily due to Ozone at some of our
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
higher elevations
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
they have a very stringent ranking
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
taking my questions one issue I wonder
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
about is whether there are Corrections
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
for local sources you know very local
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
sources at the monitoring stations I'm
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
pretty sure there's a large propane tank
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
at the top of an ad knock and also I
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
think there's a diesel generator and if
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
those are putting out uh you know
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
running locally they could screw up your
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
readings yeah we um we actually try very
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
hard we have a incredibly skilled air
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
monitoring staff
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
um very seasoned we work closely with
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
EPA in setting up our monitoring sites
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
but one of the things we certainly try
 
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
to do is we want them to be
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative of the general air
 
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
quality in that region
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
so you would try to locate your your
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
monitors in in a way such that they
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
would not be impacted directly by local
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:01.130 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
um another question related to the
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
citing of the air quality measurements
 
00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
I'm noticing there's two rather close
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
together in Portsmouth and in Rye but
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
none where I am in Manchester how do you
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
sure I'd wear just like them and um yep
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's a great that's a great question
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
and actually there's a reason we have
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
two so close to each other
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
um in Portsmouth and Rye one of the
 
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
things we've known about ozone pollution
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
in the summertime is it can penetrate
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
either right at the coast or it can
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
penetrate father Inland depending on
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
local weather conditions and whether you
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a Sea Breeze or not
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
so the one we have a little bit further
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
out at
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
Odeon point is very representative of
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
the of the ocean land interface so we
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
purposely put the one further Inland to
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
as a scientific uh monitor to see if in
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
fact the ozone is penetrating that far
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
inland so
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
um in terms of there are certain
 
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:00.980 align:start position:0%
criteria under the federal Clean Air Act
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
that determines how many monitors a
 
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:06.500 align:start position:0%
state needs generally it's a
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
population-based formula and we stick
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
consistent with what EPA requires
 
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:19.510 align:start position:0%
consistent with what EPA requires
foreign

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative Noel
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm from Berlin and I grew up with the
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
mill oh yes and I worked at the Mill and
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
I know that they did a lot of air
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
testing uh do we have access to that
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
information and could we make a
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
comparison to current air standards in
 
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.630 align:start position:0%
comparison to current air standards in
Berlin

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
Berlin
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
um we I we don't currently have a
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
monitor in Berlin historically we did
 
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
have monitors up there
 
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.529 align:start position:0%
have monitors up there
[Music]

00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:49.570 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:49.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
primarily around the paper mill as
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
you're describing because obviously that
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
was a very significant Source
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I believe we used to monitor for
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
sulfur Co and maybe some particular
 
00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:01.669 align:start position:0%
sulfur Co and maybe some particular
matter

00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
um given the current situation up in
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
Berlin we don't think that there's a
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
need to have a site-specific monitor
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
for giving me a question one really
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
quick question since it's in my area
 
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
sure can you tell me what pollutants
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
does the does the site in Londonderry
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
measure Londonderry is actually what we
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
call an encore site it's a very
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
specialized site New Hampshire has two
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
Encore sites I believe we're monitoring
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
ozone there we also have a GC there and
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
we monitor a number of volatile organic
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
compounds I think we have a trace sulfur
 
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
dioxide monitor there I think
 
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.789 align:start position:0%
dioxide monitor there I think
so

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
it's one of our most advanced most
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
recent sites thank you
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
and I could certainly Supply the
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee with a map that not only shows
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
where the monitors are but what is being
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
monitored for at that particular site if
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
Joe can make a note of that
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
that would be useful we appreciate that
 
00:32:14.649 --> 00:32:14.659 align:start position:0%
we can do that representative
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair if you could ask uh Mr
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
Wright he mentioned a GC if you could
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
explain it to the committee so a GC is a
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
gas chromatograph it's a highly
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
sensitive scientific instrument that can
 
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.010 align:start position:0%
sensitive scientific instrument that can
actually

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:36.020 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
speciate various types of volatile
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
organic compounds like it could measure
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
Benzene it can measure toluene there's a
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
whole list of air toxics that we monitor
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
at that site as part of the national
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
ozone program
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh those are all precursors to Ozone so
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's why those scientific sites were
 
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.070 align:start position:0%
that's why those scientific sites were
developed

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of the few states
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
in the country that has two Encore sites
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
we have one
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
there in Londonderry and also the one at
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
the top of Pacman that knock is an
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
encore site as well and the reason that
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
one was chosen is because it's it's a
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
high level so it's an indicate of what's
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
transported into the state
 
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
just going to say thank you okay all
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
right representative McWilliams is
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
chair bows
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I I do want to ask a follow-up
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
question I checked out the American Lung
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
Association ranking for the counties in
 
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
and so I'm seeing that we're doing
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
pretty good except for Rockingham which
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
has a c everybody else's A's and B's we
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
don't appear to have any data for
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
Carroll County Stratford County or
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County and so my question is
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
what do we need to do in order to get
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
some data for those counties if you're
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
well if you're in if we were really
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
wanted to do that we would need to
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
establish new sites
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
um what's that follow -up question
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
follow up what does that entail to
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
establish a new site well one if we we
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
would need to work it into our annual uh
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring Network plan that gets
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
reviewed by EPA to ensure that we're
 
00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:11.659 align:start position:0%
meeting the federal requirements
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing biggest hurdle would
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
probably be one finding a site which we
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
can do uh two would be equipping the
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
site and determining what you wanted to
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
monitor for I mean we are setting up a
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
new site in Laconia we're moving we're
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
at currently at with the old state
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
school is in Laconia we're going to move
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
to a more of a downtown location
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
um that's going to cost us at a minimum
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
150 000 dollars
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
so to establish a new site you're
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
probably looking at someone like 150 to
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
500 000 depending on what you want to
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative berezny has a question
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
well you guys have been saving them up
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman and thank
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
building on the previous uh question
 
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.349 align:start position:0%
building on the previous uh question
what

00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
um of the revenue chart how much of that
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
um is tied to spending any particular
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
spending for example with building a new
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
testing site does that come from the
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
um the federal funds or is it is this
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
like a general fund for the Department
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
that then pays for different things so
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
the way we've built and monitored built
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
these sites up over the years is largely
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
with the federal federal funds we get
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement
 
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
um we generally get about 1.7 million
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
dollars from EPA annually and I would
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
estimate we probably spend somewhere
 
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
750 000 to a million dollars a year on
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
maintaining the sites uh that's involves
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
buying new equipment and the staff
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
necessary to go out to the sites we've
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
done a really good job at automating
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
sites but we still need to do field
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
visits and we still need to have field
 
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.970 align:start position:0%
visits and we still need to have field
technicians

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
so EPA Logic the only the the way the
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
state is kicked in historically on our
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
ad monitoring sites is every two years
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
we do tend to put in a we do put in a
 
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
capital budget request offer some
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
equipment we've been fairly successful I
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
think the last three capital budgets and
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
we usually get somewhere in the
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of two to three hundred
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars which that goes
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
strictly to buying new equipment some of
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
our equipment is quite old
 
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:21.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
director Craig
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
um so to follow on with my colleagues
 
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.250 align:start position:0%
um so to follow on with my colleagues
question

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
um on the revenue piece if you were to
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
add additional monitoring stations for
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
the Three Counties that representative
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
McWilliams referenced
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be nice to have some information
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
there how would that affect the budget
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
and would you would you be able to to do
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
that within the constraints of the
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal monies that you received today
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
not right now yeah it would not be
 
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
not right now yeah it would not be
possible

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
um to I don't think it would be possible
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
to establish three new sites under our
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
existing federal funds okay thank you
 
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
foreign we've exhausted our questions
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
for now continue all right we'll get
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
we'll get back to the Chart we were on
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
just general air quality
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
um this is our 10 counties and the far
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
right side is high elevations again
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
that's Mount Washington and uh Pacman
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
dad knock sites the good news is
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
generally 90 of the days we have good
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
air quality in New Hampshire about 10
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
percent of the days we have moderate air
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
pollution and then a handful of days
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
when I was here when I started
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
36 years ago it wouldn't be unusual to
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
have 10 15 25 days a year primarily in
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
the summer with ozone exceedances today
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
we probably have we average Maybe
 
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
three to five exceedances a year we're
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
not in violation the way the math works
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
but in those days we try to predict
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
those days and we do put out what we
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
call air quality action days and the
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
other thing I'll just note about our
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
monitoring site if you go to the Des
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
website I should have put this in the
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
slides we have we have almost up-to-date
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
current data on our Des website of
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
current air quality it's about it's
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
about an hour old so it updates every
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
so uh this is a great chart I'll just
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
note uh that I started in 1988 so I'm
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
going to claim that this is all Craig
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
Wright uh no just kidding of course uh
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
realistically uh this chart I think
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
really portrays what it the success of
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act in New Hampshire the
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
success of our own State legislation you
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
can see here from 1990 sulfur dioxide
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
emissions are down 90 percent in the
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
state that's largely because we've
 
00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:47.099 align:start position:0%
switched away from coal as our main
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
power source and switching to Natural
 
00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:49.730 align:start position:0%
power source and switching to Natural
Gas

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
Gas
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
Co is down about 80 percent that's
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
largely because of improvements in
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh the the Berlin site
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
was historically a very large Co Source
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
but that is now gone as well Knox is
 
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:05.339 align:start position:0%
down 75 that's important nitrogen oxide
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
because that's a precursor to Ozone
 
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's one of those pollutants we need
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
to control to keep our ozone under
 
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:12.260 align:start position:0%
control plus there are health-based
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
standards for Knox itself vocs volatile
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
organic compounds down 70 percent PM 2.5
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
down 50 percent uh you can see some some
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
some years there's major drops some
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
years it's more of a gradual drop but
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is a good long-term trend for New
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we'll be updating this for
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
now I'm just going to hit some
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
highlights for our three bureaus our
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
first Bureau is our permitting
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
environmental health Bureau this is REI
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
permitting program in New Hampshire we
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
have 805 permanent facilities in New
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 28 of them are what we call
 
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
Title V sources so those are major
 
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
federal sources that require state
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
permits we have 264 temporary and state
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
operating permits those are sources at
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has decided and we've put
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
into our federal plan that we were going
 
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
to permit that level of source so I
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
would call them significant State
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
sources and then we have 422 General
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
permits and 91 permit by notifications
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
the only reason I mention them is
 
00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:18.859 align:start position:0%
because those are fully online
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
registration processes it's something
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
we've been really trying to do is get
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
all of our permits up online we're going
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
to continue to work on that so in the
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
near future and this is just some
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
statistics there I think you can see if
 
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
you look at the numbers we generally
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
what comes in goes out we've run a very
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
efficient permit program we get very few
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
complaints from our permanent sources
 
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:44.579 align:start position:0%
about timeliness which I think is good
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
means we're doing our job if you see a
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
number that's higher than the number
 
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
received that simply because there may
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
have been an application that came in
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
late the last year so generally we do a
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
pretty good job of getting permits in
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
our environmental health program is
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
within the permitting Environmental
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
Health Group this is a
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
staff of I think five or six folks they
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
not only serve the air Resources
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
Division they also serve other divisions
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
as well they work closely with the waste
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
management program and the Water
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
Division as well in that program we run
 
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
well we what we call an atsdr it's a
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
long long name there you can read that
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
for yourself but that was a grant that
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
we had had for 20 years and we lost it
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
in 2017 that provides but we did get it
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
back three years ago so that current
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
founding cycle ends in March of 2023 and
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
we just put in an application for a new
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
five-year Grant this program not only
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
serves the other divisions and the air
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
divisions with environmental health
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions but it also does a great deal
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
of community outreach in areas where
 
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:55.940 align:start position:0%
there is environmental contamination
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
they help with risk management they help
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
with communication about environmental
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
risk so it's a great it's a great
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
program very pleased to have it in the
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
air division
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
um also Senate Bill 309 a couple years
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
ago I don't remember what year created a
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
health risk assessor and a toxicologist
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
position and that continues to support
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
pfas standards and risk assessments
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
those are both generally funded
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
positions I also like to point out that
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
we as an agency help other other
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
entities such as Dartmouth and unh
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
get grants we provide technical
 
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
assistance to those folks on grant
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
opportunities and we partner with them
 
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
we don't get no money from them
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
generally it's just an in-kind service
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
that we're providing under the general
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
funds but we've been able they've been
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
able to leverage almost three quarters
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars for various studies
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
related to pfas so we're pleased to
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
continue that we've also been developing
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
some education tools for local community
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
leaders related to contamination cancer
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
investigations and we also partner very
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
heavily with dphs Department of Public
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
Health Services they also have an
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
environmental health tracking program so
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time working with
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
those folks
 
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.150 align:start position:0%
those folks
mm-hmm

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
our compliance Bureau
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
um this does exactly what you would
 
00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
think it goes out in the field does
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
compliance inspections you can see some
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
of the statistics there 57 inspections
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh one of our goals is again we're a
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
fully delegated State
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
um we have we have a department
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement policy but we also have a
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
federal enforcement policy that we need
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
to follow it's our goal to handle
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions in the state when
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
and where necessary rather than have EPA
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
come into the state we think that's we
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
can manage it I think you see down there
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
before last year we had 38 enforcement
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
actions with no federal over filing so
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
we would consider that to be a
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
successful program
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
we also do stack testing there's a
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
picture I think on the right bottom here
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
um that's one of my guys actually
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
climbing a stack uh they do literally go
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
up on the stack uh sometimes a couple
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
hundred feet above the ground
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
um so not a job for the uh for the not
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
um we also have an admissions inventory
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
program we've been working hard we have
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
to report certain emissions data and
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
compliance data up to EPA and in 2001 we
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
got a Federal grant to help bring our
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
admissions inventory database make it
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
more automated to feed information to
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
EPA rather than somebody literally
 
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
having to type into the federal system
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
we get it into our system and we
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
periodically upload to them and we also
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
got a grant last year for us to create
 
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
an online emissions reporting portal so
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
this would be industry being able to
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
report information directly into the
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
data system so I think we have a
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
question representative munz has a
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
question sure thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:00.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question of the
 
00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question of the
805

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
805
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
permitted facilities that we have in New
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how frequently does an
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
inspector get to the to each of those so
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that we have different
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
categories of sources we have the title
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
V sources which are the major sources we
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
generally have to be there at least once
 
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
every two years under the federal
 
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
every two years under the federal
program

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
all the other state sources under the
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
federal guidance we have to be there at
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
least once every five years that's boots
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
on the ground we do on occasion they
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
obviously need to file reports and
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
records with us so that is reviewed
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
whenever those reports and Records come
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
in some people report
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
quarterly some people report annually
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
but we are we are checking in between
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
the inspections and the other thing is
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
if we get a complaint against somebody
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
we generally go out and try to put boots
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
on the ground to follow up on complaints
 
00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:00.609 align:start position:0%
on the ground to follow up on complaints
foreign

00:46:00.609 --> 00:46:00.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
asbestos management the there is an
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
asbestos program in the air division
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's primarily focused on folks who do
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
demo and renovation work whether it's
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
asbestos we have we have there's a
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
federal program nishap that New
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's delegated to do we also have
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
a federal what they call a hero program
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
which is asbestos in schools they give
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
us a small amount of money and we go out
 
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
and do 30 inspections at New Hampshire
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
schools uh every year for uh make sure
 
00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:29.099 align:start position:0%
that they're managing their asbestos
 
00:46:29.099 --> 00:46:32.329 align:start position:0%
that they're managing their asbestos
properly

00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
just real quick the technical services
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
Bureau I already mentioned ambient air
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring with mobile sources program I
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
have a separate slide on that clean
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
energy we're kind of the technical arm
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
under the Reggie program puc handles uh
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
doe handles the money uh we handle the
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
technical side of implementing the
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
program same with RPS we provide
 
00:46:55.569 --> 00:46:55.579 align:start position:0%
technical support to the RPS program and
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
legislation this group the technical
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
services Bureau is generally the folks
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
that come down here to see you folks
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
that includes Becky Mike and Joe and
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
Phil this year so we track March
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislation I think every year the Year
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
division probably tracks somewhere 50 to
 
00:47:13.569 --> 00:47:13.579 align:start position:0%
70 bills depending on the year
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
not as much as we used to because there
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
is now a doe Department of energy we
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
were kind of in the past kind of I won't
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
say acted as a doe but we were probably
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit more involved in energy
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
issues but now that we have a doe we
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
certainly coordinate on energy issues
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and obviously our role is to provide
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
technical information to policy
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
committees representative Summers has a
 
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.410 align:start position:0%
committees representative Summers has a
question

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman quickly on the
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
Reggie program I know over the last 10
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
years it's been repealed and renewed how
 
00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
much the percentage of that goes to New
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what does it actually go
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
to so we have a whole presentation on
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
Reggie to go through right after I'm
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
done with this presentation could could
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
we wait for that
 
00:47:59.579 --> 00:48:03.670 align:start position:0%
we wait for that
okay

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
you're showing me at air quality
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring I assume that's outside air
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
is there an indoor air monitoring
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
program we used to have an indoor air
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
quality program we do not currently have
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
an indoor air quality program
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I think we had a small amount of
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
federal funds for that we lost that many
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
many years ago I think indoor air
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
quality may be handled by Department of
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
more than us at this point
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay just
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
um just mobile sources I already
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned them largest source of air
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
pollution in New Hampshire and pretty
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
much the country
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
um some of our mobile Source programs
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
are the annual motor vehicle inspections
 
00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
OBD everybody knows this says the check
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
engine light program everybody's
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
favorite program when they got to get
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
their car inspected uh that is in the
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
air pollution control program we have a
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
couple Grant programs deer a diesel
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
emission reduction act we get money from
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
EPA we match that money with VW money to
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
get bonus money and that helps change
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
out diesel projects across the state
 
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
would you generally go through a
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
competitive process and rank the scores
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
and things like that Granite State Clean
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
Cities Coalition this is a partnership
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
of well over a hundred Partners I think
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
Becky but the goal here is to reduce
 
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:35.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Reliance on fossil fuels
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know encourage alternative fuel
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
vehicles do a lot of Education Outreach
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
we're also work with transportation and
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions
 
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.150 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions
foreign

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
so I quickly wanted to mention
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen New Hampshire got some folks
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
may remember back a number of years ago
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen was caught in a missions
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
cheating scandal I won't go into the
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
details of that but out of that
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
settlement New Hampshire got almost 31
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh put into an
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
environmental mitigation trust fund Des
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
became the lead Agency on that trust
 
00:50:13.849 --> 00:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
fund in uh July this is August but I
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
I think it was July but I think the
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
actual paperwork went through in August
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.390 align:start position:0%
so so
um

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
we went through a we worked with oep
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
office of energy and planning back when
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
they existed before becoming part of doe
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
to come up with the mitigation plan in
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
this chart here shows the breakdown of
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
where the money is going to go 9.3
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars to Municipal 6.2 million
 
00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
to State Vehicles there's going to be a
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
pool of competitive money and the one
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we're currently working on is the
 
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
4.6 million dollars for evsc that's
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging infrastructure
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
and then also administrative costs the
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
4.6 million dollars will come nowhere
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
near using that 4.6 million dollars for
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
administrative costs uh the admin costs
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
that we don't use will get rolled back
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
into the pot to be used for uh
 
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
environmental good looks like we have a
 
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.630 align:start position:0%
environmental good looks like we have a
question

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a question yes
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you on the 4.6 million that
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
money's been sitting there for quite a
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
while has any of it been spent yet
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
because all the other states have run
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
out of their money and I know that I
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
personally we had looked into some
 
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
funding for different stations in the
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
North Country yep uh I was working with
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
councilor Kenny on this and basically it
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
kind of got dropped there for a year a
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago so because we were
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
changing from Department of energy I
 
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
know there was a there was a few factors
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering where we stand right
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
now because I get a lot of questions on
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
this yep so the next slide talks to that
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
so great question representative
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
um so we actually working with
 
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.650 align:start position:0%
um so we actually working with
um

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
um our partners at oep we actually did
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
do a solicitation a number of years ago
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what year Becky our
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
so in 2019 we did put on RFP and we got
 
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.390 align:start position:0%
so in 2019 we did put on RFP and we got
zero

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
qualified responses so obviously
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
something went wrong there so we started
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
working with oep doe when they became
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
the lead and we did put out a
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
solicitation last year I think it was
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
October no October of 21. yeah so we
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
spent a significant amount of time
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
trying to perfect that RFP we we held
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
listening sessions to to we wanted to
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
get it right this time
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
so we did uh we I forget how many
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
exactly how many responses we got to
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
that RFP and with 14 projects were
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
selected and you can see the numbers
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
here all the projects are on our
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
designated alternative fuel corridors uh
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
this this represents 31 DC fast charges
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
and 13 level 2 charges we've gotten one
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
contract through governor and Council
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I've seen at least two more come
 
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
across my desk and we think we'll have
 
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
all those contracts done in the next
 
00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.770 align:start position:0%
all those contracts done in the next
quarter

00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
it is an absolute high priority for us
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
yep we were a little bit behind the ball
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
we had that unsuccessful solicitation we
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
learned a lot from our neighboring
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
states we work closely uh you probably
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
heard of the term nescom before we part
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
of nescom is northeast states
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
coordinated air use management there's
 
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
six New England states New York New
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
Jersey uh we share information quite a
 
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.230 align:start position:0%
Jersey uh we share information quite a
bit

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.609 align:start position:0%
bit
um

00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
that we are the amount of money that
 
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
went into this pot the 4.6 million was
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
the maximum allowed under the VW Trust
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
settlement that division came through
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
that decision came through the
 
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
governor's office obviously to maximize
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
that so we we put the full 15 percent to
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
that I will just also say that the
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation also has a
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
plot of money called nevy I think that's
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
National Electric Vehicle initiative
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
so they have a part of about a little
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
over 17 million dollars to do something
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
similar to put electric vehicle charging
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we've been working
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
with them and they've been working with
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
us because we're trying to coordinate
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
these two programs as best we can but
 
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
right now this money is out there and
 
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's going to be spent they'll start
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
spending their money probably later in
 
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.030 align:start position:0%
spending their money probably later in
2023.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
2023.
 
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question uh
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um do you have
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
any statistics on utilization rates of
 
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicle charging stations
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
um because I didn't really think about
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
it but as I came through the rest area
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
today uh this morning there were there's
 
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
a whole row of them there and I don't
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
remember there being a single car there
 
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
the the generally if it's at the rest
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
area it's probably the Tesla charges
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
those are significant those are only for
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
Tesla vehicles so anybody else driving a
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
non-tesla can't charge there I've seen
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
what you've described them before I've
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
seen none or I've seen them all being
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
used I want to turn to Becky I don't
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
know I know for the contracts we're
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
letting out for the for the EV charging
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
situations they will need the track and
 
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
Report utilization rates to us but
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's those are those are sites that
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're funding so we can easily make that
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
part of the contract I don't know if
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:21.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question as
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure uh
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
regarding these charges what types of
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
sites are they actually located at I
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
mean there are rest areas but but in
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
general what sorts of sites are we so I
 
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
think the for the 14 projects we've
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
selected some of them sites I believe
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
are Supermarket sites
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
um General Store sites so they're all
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible or else we wouldn't
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
all right you guys got a lot of
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
questions today that's good
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
um just real quick major air qualities
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we've talked about
 
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
ozone ozone has historically been our
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
largest regulatory driver
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't need to beat that to death
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to jump through some
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
slides here on ozone in a minute
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
um find particulate matter has been a
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
challenge at times for us it's primarily
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
a wintertime wood smoke issue I post a
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
child for that in the past was the Keen
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
area which used to have a significant
 
00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:29.579 align:start position:0%
air quality challenges with wood smoke
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
during the winter time we actually help
 
00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
facilitate two wood stoves change Out
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
programs in the Keene area a number of
 
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
years ago and the levels of PM seem to
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
have come down we we used to issue air
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
quality action days we haven't had to
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
shoot an air quality action day for wood
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
smoke there in a number of years so
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good news story but EPA
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
is talking about revising that standard
 
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh Regional Haze this isn't a health
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
program I have a slide in this later on
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's really visibility of up in what we
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
call class one areas New Hampshire has
 
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:03.500 align:start position:0%
two class one areas that receive special
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
consideration under the federal Clean
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
Air Act and one of those programs is to
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that visibility returns to what
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
they call natural conditions by 2064. so
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to be well after I'm here
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're actually making very good progress
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
we've gone through two 10-year planning
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
periods on the regional Haze program and
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm looking forward to being retired
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
before we have to do the third 10-year
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
plan so
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
the class one areas in case you're
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
wondering are up in the White Mountains
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
no big surprise these are Wilderness
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
areas over 5 000 Acres like I said New
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has two of them
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh just real quick ozone there's there's
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
good ozone in this bad ozone the good
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
ozone is the ozone up in our
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
Stratosphere that's what protects us
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
from UV radiation from the sun we all
 
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
used to hear about the hole in the ozone
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
layer my understanding that's getting
 
00:57:59.339 --> 00:58:00.609 align:start position:0%
layer my understanding that's getting
better

00:58:00.609 --> 00:58:00.619 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
the battle zone is the stuff that's at
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
ground level it's it's not naturally
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
occurring it's man-made due to pollution
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
um it's it's nitrogen oxides and vocs in
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
the presence of sunlight so it's a
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
summertime issue
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you can read this but basically ozone
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
is bad for your lungs
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
um if you if you're a compromised
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
situation you have bronchitis you have
 
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
asthma ozone is going to make that
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
situation much worse it increases the
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
frequency of asthma attacks makes lungs
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
more susceptible to infection and New
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does generally have high
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
levels of asthma especially in our in
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things we recognized and
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
somebody brought this up before and
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the question of air
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
pollution brought into the state we are
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
part under the Clean Air Act of what we
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
call the ozone transport region that's
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
these 13 states right here which goes
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
from most of Maine all the way down to
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
parts of Virginia and Washington DC the
 
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act recognized that no
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
individual State can solve the ozone
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
problem it's a transport component to it
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
so there is an ozone transport
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
commission commissioner Scott sits on
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
that I generally go to the meetings as
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's representative this
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
group can look at modeling it can look
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
at inventories it can look at what types
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
of control strategies we need and we
 
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
have in fact adopted some control
 
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
strategies consistent with the other
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
states in the region
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
this is a good new chart I mentioned the
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
Knacks those are the air quality
 
00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
standards you can see this red line you
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
can see how the red line has changed our
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
period used to be 85 Parts billion then
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
75 parts per billion then 70 parts per
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
billion that's EPA revising the
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
health-based standard this looks at our
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
long-term ozone Trends in New Hampshire
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
and you can see there were times in the
 
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
past where we were above the red line
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's when we would have been in
 
00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.890 align:start position:0%
that's when we would have been in
non-attainment

00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:56.900 align:start position:0%
non-attainment
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
so this is a I think this is a great
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
chart because it shows we're making
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
progress the the standards are getting
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
tighter but also our readings are
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
getting better so I think it's a good
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
news story
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
just real quick representative Doug
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
question so um involving the EPA
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
standards that have been where the
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
standards have been reduced over the
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
years can you explain to me what
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
obviously we have better science but
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
what drives them to be able to lower the
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
standards uh in terms of um uh are they
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
going towards a particular goal has
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
science gotten better or are they just
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
lowering them because they can I I would
 
01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
generally say that first of all there's
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
always controversy when EPA sets the
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
standards right some people think they
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
should be lower some people think they
 
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
should be less stringent
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
EPA has a very formal process
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
um they've they form a panel known as
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
ksac I don't recall exactly what that
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
stands for but they assemble a panel of
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
experts what those panels of experts
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
will do is evaluate health studies to
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
understand how a particular pollutant
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
impacts human health then based on those
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
studies based on their recommendation of
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
that committee EPA goes through a formal
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process which is a course of
 
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
public process
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
it it can EPA just proposed a new
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
NAX standard for PM
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
um they just put a proposal out right
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
around Christmas time I suspect it will
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
take them
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
at least a year to complete the
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and then now we'll
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
start a three-year clock for New
 
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to evaluate where we are with
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.710 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
there must look in my mind be a
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
threshold level where of naturally
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
occurring ozone because ionizing
 
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
radiation and so forth and so how
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
clearly we're trying to approach that
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
but uh we're never going to get there
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
there is a natural level I guess you
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
could call it background conditions
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
where are the standard is above that as
 
01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
as far as my understanding
 
01:02:18.059 --> 01:02:19.190 align:start position:0%
as far as my understanding
um

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:22.569 --> 01:02:22.579 align:start position:0%
the 70s standard has been in place since
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
2014 2015 EPA is currently looking at
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
the ozone standard I don't suspect
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to make another change at
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
all right fine particular matter to me
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
in a way this is a more challenging
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
pollutant because there are some health
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
studies out there that say any fine
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
particular matter is bad for human
 
01:02:48.299 --> 01:02:49.730 align:start position:0%
particular matter is bad for human
health

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
um what is fine particularly it's a
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
complex mixture of really tiny particles
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
and liquid droplets on the left of this
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
slide is a human hair 70 microns so you
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
can see PM 2.5 and PM 2.10 are much
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
tinier than even a human hair so the
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
problem with that small of a particle is
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
it penetrates very deeply into the lungs
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
and can actually also penetrate into the
 
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular system so it's it it's so
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
small it has impacts not only in lungs
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
but heart health as well so
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
similar to the Chart we just saw on
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
ozone we can see real quickly here that
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
the changing in the ozone health-based
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
standard again good news story our
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
numbers are generally going down
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
I want to pick up the pace here because
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
I know we want to do Reggie too so um
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
Regional Haze again this is the program
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
in our class one areas
 
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:44.930 align:start position:0%
in our class one areas
um

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
this shows on a good Clear Day
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
visibility range of 118 miles a bad
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
visibility day of 20 miles that's a hazy
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
day those aren't clouds that's air
 
01:03:57.289 --> 01:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
pollution that's very fine particles in
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere either sulfur particles
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
nitrogen particles or even sea salt to
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
some degree that all impacts visibility
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
so it's not a health issue it's a
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
quality of life issue I mean everybody
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
wants to go up to the mountains and see
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
the mountains right we don't want to get
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
there and not see the mountains
 
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
um just real quick I want to hit real
 
01:04:19.569 --> 01:04:19.579 align:start position:0%
quick some pfas slides uh RSA 20
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
125c10e requirements for Air emissions
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
this was the put in place obviously
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
because of the situation that occurred
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
down in Merrimack around the saint
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
Cobain facility it requires a number of
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
things to be done in those types of
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
situations I won't get into the details
 
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
other than to say what we're doing right
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
now is working uh diligently to make
 
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
sure that we're complying with the
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
statute there as you can see some of
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
this triggers off of if there are
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
ambient air ground ambient groundwater
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
quality standards so this is the first
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
time we've had a state statute that
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
looks at air depositing on the soil and
 
01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
eventually getting into the groundwater
 
01:04:59.329 --> 01:04:59.339 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a unique uh situation
 
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
kind of unforeseen in the past so
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
um last year there was 20 20 22
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislation to require the department to
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
look at science what studies are out
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
there do we need to look at
 
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
strengthening any ambient air quality
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
standards we have for pfas we did do a
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
review uh this year uh led by Dr
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
Jonathan patelli and our environmental
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
health risk group and we made he made no
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations to adopt any new
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
standards simply because there's not a
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
lot of good science in this air in this
 
01:05:39.849 --> 01:05:39.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes um back on the
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
pfas issue uh I understand that it is a
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
unique issue but I was wondering you
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that your department
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
does do enforcement in terms of air
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
quality and I'm wondering whether we are
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
engaged as a state solely in mitigation
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
of the problem or whether there's a
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
we've actually stopped them from
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
continuing to support uh emitting uh in
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
other words is it is it a continuing
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
problem or is it something that has been
 
01:06:12.599 --> 01:06:13.210 align:start position:0%
problem or is it something that has been
um

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:13.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
addressed so there's a couple a couple
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
quick comments on that um back in 2004
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
the saint Cobain facility was found to
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
be emitting levels of
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
an ammonium salt of pfas I think it was
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
uh apfo or something like that which was
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
regulated under our air toxics program
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
and it the information we got from them
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
from doing some stack testing albeit it
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
was very
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
primitive stack testing at the time
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't a really good Federal
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
method to measure pfas in the air coming
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
out of the stack so they were required
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
to reduce the constant content of those
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
Coatings literally it could have been
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
from tens of thousands parts per million
 
01:06:58.849 --> 01:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
in the coating down to like 75 parts per
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
million so that was the first step
 
01:07:03.849 --> 01:07:03.859 align:start position:0%
then obviously we got into the situation
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
that we're faced with right now and
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
that's the contamination of groundwater
 
01:07:08.099 --> 01:07:09.549 align:start position:0%
that's the contamination of groundwater
that

01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
rsa125c10e one of the requirements of
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
that is if you cause or have the
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
potential to cause a groundwater of
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
exceedings you have to do what we call
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
best available control technology and
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we required Saint Cobain to
 
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
do they installed a regenerative thermal
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
oxidizer in place and that's been tested
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
twice successfully so
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
they are down to the point where they're
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
if releasing very very minor amounts
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
probably less than one or two pounds a
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
year compared to in the past when they
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
may have been as high as 900 pounds or
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
more so yes we've made a lot of strides
 
01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
more so yes we've made a lot of strides
foreign

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh just
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
following up on on the previous question
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
recently Saint Cobain self reported that
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
the rtos failed uh and they admitted uh
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
17 pounds of pfas chemicals into the air
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
were they held accountable whereas there
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
were a financial fine and or do we rely
 
01:08:13.329 --> 01:08:13.339 align:start position:0%
only on self-reporting
 
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
they well there's two things
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
um they obviously have to do monitoring
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
record keeping and Reporting on a
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
regular basis under their air permit
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
they have to report to us
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
what we call permit deviations the most
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
recent one may have been
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
in the last month they had they're
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
required to maintain a certain
 
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
temperature operating temperature in the
 
01:08:38.769 --> 01:08:38.779 align:start position:0%
RTO and that's monitored across the RTO
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
and they dropped like 1.5 degrees below
 
01:08:45.169 --> 01:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
the minimum required in the permit and
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
they reported that as a deviation that's
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do they do have
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
a bypass stack on the incinerator and I
 
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
know that's caused a lot of angst from
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
people who are currently evaluating the
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
bypass stack as part of their air permit
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
application to renew their permit so
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be beginning a public process on
 
01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
that pretty soon
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
plus I mentioned we do require the
 
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
annual test of the incinerator they do
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
hire a third party person to do that
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
testing Des is on site we had two
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
seasoned veterans on site when they did
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
the test last fall
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
we oversee that testing we oversee what
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
the production processes are to make
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
sure the processes that they're running
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
are representative of what they're doing
 
01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis so there is definitely
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground there
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes please when you are
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
referred to a failure creating angst to
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
people can you explain what you mean by
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
that oh I I obviously I when the bypass
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
stack first came to be known it was not
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
in the permit
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
um we determined that during one of our
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
inspections and I I think obviously
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
local people are concerned with making
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure that if they're going to continue
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
to operate that they operate in
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with their permits that's
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
kind of what I was alluding to
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
are pfas chemicals a component of the PM
 
01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.890 align:start position:0%
are pfas chemicals a component of the PM
2.5

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:17.900 align:start position:0%
2.5
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
matter that's being monitored
 
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
um there is there are ambient levels so
 
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
in the General Air there is pfas we know
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's a worldwide it's ubiquitous across
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
the environment at this point
 
01:10:34.199 --> 01:10:35.030 align:start position:0%
the environment at this point
um

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
so I don't know offhand if it I believe
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
it probably isn't a particulate form by
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
that point in time but I'm not 100
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
certain I would need to check on that
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh this was a single Bane slide
 
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we've just mentioned we've already
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
gone through two rounds of Stack testing
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh we are going to be going out with
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
their operating permit public Hearing in
 
01:11:11.169 --> 01:11:11.179 align:start position:0%
early 2023 so coming up shortly
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
we have tested a couple other facilities
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
well at least one other facility in the
 
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.630 align:start position:0%
well at least one other facility in the
state

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
um and no issues subject to similar to
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
what we've seen at St Cobain have we
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
found at those other facilities
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
all right my last slide before you get
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
to talk to Joe about Reggie
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
um EPA put out a strategic plan last
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
year to cover the
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
2022-2026 time frame they listed Seven
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
major strategic goals in that plan I'm
 
01:11:43.729 --> 01:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
not going to go through all of them I am
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
just going to hit the top two though
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
climate change and environmental justice
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
and civil rights
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
I can't go to a call a meeting with EPA
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
with those two words those two subject
 
01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:57.620 align:start position:0%
matters are brought up uh climate change
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
and environmental justice as part of the
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
IRA Bill inflation reduction act there's
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in there epa's still
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how they're going
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
to spend some of it to be honest with
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
you they currently have six or seven
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
open dockets where they've asked
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions of people but how do we want
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
to invest this money in climate change
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
strategies how do we want to invest this
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
money in environmental justice and civil
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
rights EJ or environmental justice is
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
becoming a bigger and bigger issue
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have an EJ
 
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.850 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have an EJ
statute

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:36.860 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
we the department does have a civil
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
rights non-discrimination plan that was
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
just signed off by the commissioner back
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
in October I think it's a 17-page
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
document talking about how the
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
department will Implement its programs
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
and compliance with the federal title VI
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
civil rights law but there's also an
 
01:12:58.689 --> 01:12:58.699 align:start position:0%
environmental justice component to that
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
so we will continue to to monitor that a
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
lot of what environmental justice
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
entails is what they call disparate
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
impacts and disadvantaged communities
 
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
impacts and disadvantaged communities
um

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
disparate impacts and cumulative impacts
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
those are words that we hear all the
 
01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
time from EPA but there's not a lot of
 
01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
federal guidance on how you implement a
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
lot of these these uh these programs so
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're working closely we have an
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
internal team at DES looking at this
 
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.189 align:start position:0%
internal team at DES looking at this
issue

01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
we think it could come up in some
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
hearings we may have coming up for some
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
permanent facilities we're going to
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor that part of a big
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
part of EJ is make sure you do good
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
Community engagement meaningful
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
Community engagement if they're a
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
minority speaking folks make sure that
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
you you know putting out information in
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
their native language so they understand
 
01:13:55.689 --> 01:13:55.699 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
but the big challenge is going to be if
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
you find a disparate or cumulative
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
impact how do you define that and then
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
what do you do about it because there's
 
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
really nothing in statute as to how you
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
how you implement that so waiting for
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
some more Federal guidance on that
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
program it's a priority of the current
 
01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.669 align:start position:0%
program it's a priority of the current
Administration

Administration
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you director Wright uh
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.649 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
question

01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.370 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:21.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:23.780 align:start position:0%
I've got a question that's
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
may not be widely accepted but
 
01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.330 align:start position:0%
may not be widely accepted but
um

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
we recognize the fact that the uh that
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
the climate is changing uh and also that
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything we can to help
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
um get rid of the pollutants in the
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
years is but the climate is changing
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
anyway and so my question would be is
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
have you heard of any discussions within
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
the federal government on any monies
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
that could also be used to help us
 
01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:57.260 align:start position:0%
prepare for the changing of the climate
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
in addition to the fact that we're
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce pollutants to maybe
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
slow it down but has there been any talk
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
about preparing how we can help
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves for the climate that is
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
changing so some some of the money
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
contained in the ira the inflation
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
reduction act I believe will go towards
 
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
not only
 
01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.770 align:start position:0%
not only
planning

01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:17.780 align:start position:0%
planning
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
mitigation but also how do we respond to
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
it you know how do we build uh better
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to deal with the change
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
in climate how do we do we look at you
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
know the size of culverts uh from from
 
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
Heavy Rain events which I think some of
 
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
us would agree that you know what we see
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
today is different than when I was a kid
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
I can say that unequivocably
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
um I recognize that weather changes year
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
to year but there does certainly seem to
 
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
be some component there that is uh
 
01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:54.140 align:start position:0%
changing that's for sure
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes my question
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
was also I was waiting until you were
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
done with your slides to come back to it
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
on slide 21 the last bullet was under
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
major air quality issues was climate
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
change and clean energy and I wondered
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
why it was on that slide
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
um but you know I don't think you spoke
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
to it or had anything to say about it on
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
this committee I think from a policy
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint we look at bills all the time
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh that are proposed in order to either
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
have better planning around addressing
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
climate change or or bringing our
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
policies up to Snuff with what is going
 
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:35.540 align:start position:0%
on you know regionally internationally
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and clean energy was listed there as
 
01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
well so I was just wondering why that
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
bullet was there and if you could just
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
say a little bit about why it's under
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
under that I I think it's just a
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
recognition of
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
um if we're gonna if you're gonna deal
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
with climate issues you need to deal
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
with energy issues
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
um most of our missions that are related
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
to climate change CO2 are related to
 
01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
energy usage rather it's in the
 
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
transportation sector in terms of uh
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
burning few we all burn I'm sure most of
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
us drove a gasoline car here today that
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
certainly has CO2 emissions
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so in my mind I think in the
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
Department's mind clean energy and
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
climate are interrelated but there's a
 
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
lot of benefits to clean energy not just
 
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.689 align:start position:0%
lot of benefits to clean energy not just
climate

01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
climate
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
clean energy also has other air quality
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
benefits as well
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
represented and I simply I'll apologize
 
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
I just skipped over that slide in my
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
haste but I knew climate was also coming
 
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
back under the federal policy side
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
because that is a huge priority for the
 
01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:36.709 align:start position:0%
because that is a huge priority for the
administration

01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
and we've consistently told the
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
administration that
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
if you want to go down the road of
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
working in this area States would need
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
resources States can't do this without
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground and funding to do
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
some of the things that may need to be
 
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.910 align:start position:0%
some of the things that may need to be
done

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
and ideally uh
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
leading at the federal level makes a lot
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
of sense to me at some level in some
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
ways because it is it's a national thing
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
more than just a state issue
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my question was
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
just really a follow-on to
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's question maybe
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
just try to elucidate a little more
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
more detail to what extent has Des been
 
01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.229 align:start position:0%
more detail to what extent has Des been
involved

01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
um you know since I was a city council
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth I know that cities and our
 
01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.910 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth I know that cities and our
cities

01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
cities
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
plant Regional planning commissions
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
around the state have been
 
01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:37.189 align:start position:0%
around the state have been
um

01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
making efforts to help localities adapt
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
to the changing climate
 
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.050 align:start position:0%
to the changing climate
um

01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
prepare their infrastructure make their
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure more resilient to the
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
increased flooding and things like that
 
01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.189 align:start position:0%
increased flooding and things like that
so

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
um to what extent has is des involved in
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
those or helping direct or helping funds
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple different areas we
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
can point to obviously in terms of
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
mitigation we're obviously part of the
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
Reggie program and you're going to hear
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
about Reggie
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
um Des kind of serves as the technical
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
resource on Reggie
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
we do all the Contracting with Reggie
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
Inc but that's getting into those
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
details that Joe will probably cover
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
um new we also provide support to the
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards program in
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's a role for Des
 
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
there and certifying that sources are
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
meeting the emission limitations to
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
qualify for the wrecks
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
not so much the air division
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
um although we did have a position a
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
number of years ago that had a small
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
climate Grant
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
um through Homeland Security
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and that person largely worked with
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
like the coastal adaptation work group
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
Des is a big partner working with
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
Coastline communities and planning for
 
01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.390 align:start position:0%
Coastline communities and planning for
uh

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
resiliency and things along those lines
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we also were working with the Upper
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
Valley area as well but I will say we
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of resources in this
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
area in terms of that's why I mentioned
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
one of the stress points we've given to
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
the administration is if you want work
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
in this area you need to fund it
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's all there's more that
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
hey I suggest we move on to the Reggie
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
program uh I'm sure Joe will be mindful
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
of the fact that uh the lunch hour uh
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
will be starting soon
 
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
yep see they use the arrow keys too or
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:49.850 align:start position:0%
not uh
yep

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
good morning again my name is Joe
 
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.550 align:start position:0%
good morning again my name is Joe
Fontaine

01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
Fontaine
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
I have
 
01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:17.420 align:start position:0%
been the department representative
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
managing the New Hampshire
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
portion of the Reggie program
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
typically the first slide of a
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
presentation is fluff
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
but on this slide I have the link to the
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
the Reggie website
 
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of good information I'm not
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
going to be able to cover everything
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
today so if you're interested in more
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
details about the Reggie program
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to go to the Reggie
 
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.570 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to go to the Reggie
website

01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.270 align:start position:0%
website
foreign

01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to start off with a little
 
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does have a 2009 climate
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
action plan and one recommendation
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
of that plan was to implement Reggie
 
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
and the link to that website for the
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
climate action plan is is at the top
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
kind of small but it's there
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
um so in statute New Hampshire statute
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements is for
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
a joint report from the Department of
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and now
 
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
to file an annual report and to
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
update the the legislature on
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
a number of allowances sold number of
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
allowances not sold which
 
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
all of them in recent years have sold
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
that there was a period in the early
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
years of Reggie where a few went unsold
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
um price data
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
Market monitoring reports again on that
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
Reggie website we have a market monitor
 
01:23:11.649 --> 01:23:11.659 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of the program
 
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:15.020 align:start position:0%
there's been no evidence of
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
collusion or manipulative behavior on
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
the part of the bidders
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
maybe to back up a step I thought Craig
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
was going to include one slide on Reggie
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
in his presentation but basically we
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
have a diagram on
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
how Reggie works is
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's a program to reduce CO2 emissions
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emissions from power
 
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
plants and so there's a regional cap
 
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
each state has a budget that decreases
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
the allowances they're called which
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
represent one ton of emissions get
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
auction quarterly and at the end of a
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
three-year compliance period each power
 
01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
plant has to have enough allowances to
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
cover its emissions
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
um there is a provision that at the end
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
of each year they have to cover half
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
their emissions
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
but I digress
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.310 align:start position:0%
um so
um

01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
other other requirements of the annual
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
report are on emissions both state level
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
and Regional level and so I have a few
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
slides from the most recent report
 
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
this November
 
01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:29.810 align:start position:0%
this November
um

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
that I'll get to but I just wanted to go
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
over first
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
um as I said a little bit of historical
 
01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.050 align:start position:0%
um as I said a little bit of historical
perspective

01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.669 align:start position:0%
perspective
so

01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
in the early years there were bills put
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
in to repeal Reggie
 
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:48.890 align:start position:0%
and I think
um

01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
what the legislature has settled on is
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as contingent repeal
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
um if Massachusetts or two other New
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
England states
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
drop out of Reggie then there's
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
provision in the statute that New
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would drop out
 
01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.450 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would drop out
um

01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:07.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
that makes sense because if New
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to drop out by itself it
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
would not have a large impact on
 
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
electricity rates
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire would
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
forego any revenue from the Reggie
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
program and I'm I'm going to get to a
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
slide on the revenue so you'll see that
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
um going back in time in 2017
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
senator avard who was the Prime sponsor
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
of a bill to for a study committee to to
 
01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:46.340 align:start position:0%
look at costs in the electricity system
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a link to that report of
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
that study committee but
 
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:53.219 align:start position:0%
one of the two are two of the major
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
findings of that report were
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution costs are
 
01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:01.139 align:start position:0%
increasing and Energy Efficiency is one
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
way to offset
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
so this is a slide from ISO New England
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
which I guess you're going to hear from
 
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
at some point but um
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
they do annually do forecasts
 
01:26:19.679 --> 01:26:21.530 align:start position:0%
they do annually do forecasts
and

01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
two of the forecasts are
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
now our transportation and heating
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
electrification and how that increases
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
the load
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
for the regional at the regional level
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that goes into the gross load and
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
then Energy Efficiency and
 
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
BTM is behind the meter
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
solar or distributed energy
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
um reduce the gross load and you get a
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
net load so you know this savings from
 
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency I think in the
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
presentation last week from the consumer
 
01:26:59.770 --> 01:26:59.780 align:start position:0%
Advocate on crease he talked about
 
01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.139 align:start position:0%
nanowatts negative megawatts and so
 
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
kind of shows how
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
it reduces the gross load to the net
 
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.870 align:start position:0%
it reduces the gross load to the net
load

01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
load
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
another slide from ISO New England on
 
01:27:15.239 --> 01:27:16.850 align:start position:0%
another slide from ISO New England on
costs

01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
um not it's hard to read and I'm not
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to go into detail on it but just
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
if you just look at the bar graph
 
01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:24.890 align:start position:0%
if you just look at the bar graph
um

01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
the Reggie portion is a very small
 
01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.850 align:start position:0%
the Reggie portion is a very small
portion

01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:30.620 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
overall cost for generation
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
and you know again this was talked about
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
last week I believe
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
um but electricity costs track natural
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
gas prices or fuel costs those are the
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
major component
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
that impacts electricity costs
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
so getting to some of the slides that
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
are in the annual report that doe and
 
01:28:00.179 --> 01:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
are in the annual report that doe and
Des

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
Des
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
submit to the legislature
 
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
this is a slide on the New Hampshire
 
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
specific slide on the four different uh
 
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.610 align:start position:0%
specific slide on the four different uh
utilities

01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:12.620 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
and their typical bill
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
as of August 1st 2022
 
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:23.699 align:start position:0%
and you can barely read the the Reggie
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
portion at the top
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
the blue portion at the bottom again is
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
is fuel costs and you have transmission
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
and distribution costs are major costs
 
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.590 align:start position:0%
and distribution costs are major costs
um

01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
again from the annual report
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
doe commented that
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
the costs are very small about
 
01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
a tenth of a percent
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire that translates to
 
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
about 21 cents per month
 
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
for the average residential customer
 
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
and the impact can be offset by
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
investment in Energy Efficiency
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the next slide I'm going to go over
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
is under current law
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is how the Reggie funds are
 
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.330 align:start position:0%
this is how the Reggie funds are
distributed

01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned this quarterly auctions
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
so the four quarterly auctions together
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
from from last year were about 43
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Revenue
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
um that goes into the Energy Efficiency
 
01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
fund so so Reggie sometimes people get
 
01:29:37.490 --> 01:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
confused between Reggie and RPS
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
RPS the renewable portfolio standard is
 
01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
the Reggie money goes into the Energy
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund not the renewable energy
 
01:29:46.199 --> 01:29:47.810 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund not the renewable energy
fund

01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:48.590 align:start position:0%
fund
um

01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
and so the breakdown
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
is according to what we call the Dollar
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
threshold which was enacted a few years
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
back 2013 I believe
 
01:30:02.639 --> 01:30:03.189 align:start position:0%
back 2013 I believe
um

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
and so in 2022 there are roughly
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
3.21 million allowances sold
 
01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
so only the first dollar of that goes to
 
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
the funding of the Energy Efficiency
 
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
the funding of the Energy Efficiency
programs

01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
supplements the SBC
 
01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
the remainder above a dollar goes to
 
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
Great payer rebates and
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
just the general rule of thumb we we
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
assume 60 40
 
01:30:38.649 --> 01:30:38.659 align:start position:0%
UH 60 percent to
 
01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial customers
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
40 to residential
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
so most of the money under current law
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
um again from the annual report the last
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
I actually uh the report as I said was
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
in November there was another auction in
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
December so I added that in here so five
 
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.390 align:start position:0%
December so I added that in here so five
auctions

01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
auctions
 
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
since the previous annual report
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's why the 55 million is a
 
01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
little higher than the 43 million on the
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
previous slide
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
auction prices
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
over that last five auction cycle range
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
from you know around thirteen dollars to
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
almost fourteen dollars Which is higher
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
so just the high level overview you know
 
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
Reggie started off
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh the first three years uh with a flat
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
cap and and then it gradually declines
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so it sends a predictable Market
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
signal that the regulated Community the
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
power plants can react to in advance and
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
and know what they and plan and know um
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
how much they can emit
 
01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.590 align:start position:0%
how much they can emit
um

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.629 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the slide there there
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
again is mentioned of the um
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
dollar threshold for allowance is
 
01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.550 align:start position:0%
dollar threshold for allowance is
rebated

01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
rebated
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
so I think you're gonna
 
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
in this in the session you got several
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
bills that address
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
a possible amendment to that dollar
 
01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
a possible amendment to that dollar
threshold

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
preview of coming attractions
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to again touch base
 
01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.490 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to again touch base
historically

01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:38.030 align:start position:0%
historically
um

01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
we do at the regional level uh periodic
 
01:32:44.169 --> 01:32:44.179 align:start position:0%
program reviews
 
01:32:47.689 --> 01:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
roughly every four years five years or
 
01:32:52.209 --> 01:32:52.219 align:start position:0%
so so the last one was done in 2016
 
01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:56.060 align:start position:0%
actually finalized in 2017 I believe
 
01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.649 align:start position:0%
actually finalized in 2017 I believe
and

01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:57.659 --> 01:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
the the recommendation uh for post 2020
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
through 2030 was to maintain a similar
 
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:09.020 align:start position:0%
Glide path
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
to the reduction slope that we were on
 
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:17.060 align:start position:0%
so at the regional level that's about
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
2.275 million tons
 
01:33:19.679 --> 01:33:23.629 align:start position:0%
2.275 million tons
and

01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire and Maine got a slight
 
01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.910 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire and Maine got a slight
deal

01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
deal
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
that they other states did additional
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
reductions in 2021
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and made in New Hampshire did not
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
and we did also did not do
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
an emissions containment Reserve that
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
seven other states did
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
so this slide goes into a little more
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
detail on that
 
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.430 align:start position:0%
detail on that
um

01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
the goal regionally was to get to 30
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
percent so
 
01:33:58.970 --> 01:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
when I say New Hampshire got a slight
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
deal I think made in New Hampshire doing
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
about 29.1 percent so
 
01:34:05.159 --> 01:34:05.750 align:start position:0%
about 29.1 percent so
um

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
but some of the other states did a
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
little bit more in 2021 so that
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
regionally we got to 30 percent
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
reduction by 2030.
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh in the cap
 
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.330 align:start position:0%
uh in the cap
um

01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:22.370 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
um now we're in the midst of another
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
program review
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing analysis again if you go
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
to the Reggie website on that first
 
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
slide you can sign up to receive emails
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
and participate in the process comment
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you want there are a number of
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
comments on there already
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.770 align:start position:0%
but um
so

01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has been
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
some uncertainty about that
 
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
we hope to address in in 2023 2023 when
 
01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:12.290 align:start position:0%
we hope to address in in 2023 2023 when
we

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
go through uh and complete program
 
01:35:14.639 --> 01:35:16.189 align:start position:0%
go through uh and complete program
review

01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh which states are in which states are
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
out so
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
New Jersey originally was in the program
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
back 2009 to 2011.
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh then Governor Christie took them out
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
they came back in in 2020
 
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh Virginia
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
is in the program in 2021 and but there
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
new governor
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
um has said that they will be out by the
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
end of 2023
 
01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:52.870 align:start position:0%
end of 2023
Pennsylvania

01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
talked about coming in uh
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
they went to court
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's still in court we're waiting to get
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
a court decision by the Pennsylvania
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court as to whether
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
um they will come in uh they obviously
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
didn't come in in 2022 so I'm hopeful
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
that they come in in 2023 and also North
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
Carolina has talked about coming in
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
uh again 2023 may be ambitious for them
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
more likely 2024.
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
but in general the more states that are
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
in the program that reduces the cost for
 
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
the other states like New Hampshire's
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
costs could go down if it's spread out
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
amongst more States
 
01:36:39.659 --> 01:36:41.450 align:start position:0%
amongst more States
so

01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned we're currently in
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
program review very possible
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire May seek another
 
01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:49.669 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire May seek another
um

01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
deal on um
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
we I think we intend to make no further
 
01:36:59.090 --> 01:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
cap reduction before 2031
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
the past program review went through
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
2030 so we want to give power plants
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
time to plan
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
for any changes that get made
 
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:13.910 align:start position:0%
for any changes that get made
uh

01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
another requirement of the annual report
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
is emissions so this first slide on
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
emissions is New Hampshire emissions
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
and you can see there's generally a
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
downward Trend
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned
 
01:37:27.179 --> 01:37:28.790 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned
um

01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 2020 New Jersey is in 2021
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
New Jersey and Virginia are in so
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
those bars go up but that's because
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
there's more States in not necessarily
 
01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:42.410 align:start position:0%
there's more States in not necessarily
because

01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
the nine state emissions continue to go
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
down so
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
at the top you can see that 2022 overall
 
01:37:52.139 --> 01:37:53.330 align:start position:0%
at the top you can see that 2022 overall
budget

01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
but this is for New Hampshire
 
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.169 align:start position:0%
but this is for New Hampshire
um

01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
was 3.8 million and the total emissions
 
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
the black bar
 
01:38:05.770 --> 01:38:05.780 align:start position:0%
on the right
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
is a little higher than than 2 million
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
so we were well within the New Hampshire
 
01:38:12.719 --> 01:38:14.870 align:start position:0%
so we were well within the New Hampshire
budget

01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then this is regional and this is
 
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:18.950 align:start position:0%
and then this is regional and this is
the

01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh one where the the last two years
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
include more States
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so again Regional cap
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
2021 was 119 million
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
um almost 120 million and
 
01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:39.179 align:start position:0%
the far right
 
01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
Blue Bar
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
below that so well within the regional
 
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.510 align:start position:0%
below that so well within the regional
cap

01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
so good story
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
and just uh
 
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
my information and Mike who
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
apologizes couldn't be here today
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
feel free to call me or email me with
 
01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.110 align:start position:0%
feel free to call me or email me with
questions

01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you I stayed within the time
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
frame you did an integrated great job
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
Joe we appreciate it we're getting
 
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
Joe we appreciate it we're getting
hungry

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:13.870 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:15.550 align:start position:0%
hungry
[Laughter]

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to go back to the your
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
previous Slide the six involving the
 
01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:28.139 align:start position:0%
annual energy forecast which you said
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
you uh you obtained via ISO New England
 
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.930 align:start position:0%
you uh you obtained via ISO New England
information

01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I have a question that will propagate
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up the um the last column on
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
the right is that indicative of the
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
amount of energy that's going to be
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
needed in New England per
 
01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
per year
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes so follow-up question
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you uh so is there a
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
another column or is there a slide that
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
shows how much energy production is
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to be available per year and I
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't mean what we have a lot of
 
01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
proposals out there but we all know that
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
very few of them actually get approved
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
over time so is there any information
 
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
involving how much energy is going to be
 
01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:17.750 align:start position:0%
involving how much energy is going to be
available

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
per year to to be put with the slide so
 
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why this slide
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
was was excerpted from an ISO report but
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the functions of iso New
 
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
England to manage the grid so you know
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
annually that's what they're doing is
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that there's available
 
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.050 align:start position:0%
making sure that there's available
capacity

01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:41.060 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
more than available to meet the expected
 
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.689 align:start position:0%
more than available to meet the expected
demand

01:40:47.689 --> 01:40:47.699 align:start position:0%
demand
 
01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
um that so ISO and New England would
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has the question
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah this is just
 
01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
a a pretty a pretty small question that
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
relates to second to last slide
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire CO2 emissions from
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
applicable sources so this is showing us
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
that what we know there are really only
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
three power plants in New Hampshire
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
subject to Reggie emitting carbon and
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
two of them I know are
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
Newington near where I live and then the
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
Granite Ridge I believe is the one in Mr
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
and representative Thomas's District
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and then what's the third
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
one so this is actually five plants five
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
plants um but there's three companies if
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%
um so there's Granite Ridge which is
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
just south of the Manchester Airport
 
01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
which is a gas plant
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
this essential power Newington which is
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
also a gas plant and then the other bar
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
is a combination of the three
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
Granite Shore plants you formerly PS and
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
H plants so those are Merrimack station
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
Schiller station uh in Portsmouth and
 
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
Newington station
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
and am I correct those are the
 
01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.510 align:start position:0%
and am I correct those are the
coal-fired

01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
coal-fired
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
so Newington is not coal-fired
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
um Schiller was coal-fired they
 
01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
converted one unit to biomass but now
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
they don't operate at all
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and Merrimack is still coal-fired
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
operates infrequently and Bo in Boeing
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it's kind of confusing it's
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
Miramax station it's inbox yeah thank
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you I
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
have a question Joe do the biomass
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
plants in the North Country Bridgewater
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
and Burgess biopower are they subject to
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh Reggie
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
currently they are not that's an
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
advantage to them they don't have to buy
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
allowances to cover their emissions and
 
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is we've generally
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
regarded biomass as uh
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral or mostly carbon neutral
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
in that trees grow in the forest and
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
offset the emissions
 
01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:20.930 align:start position:0%
offset the emissions
um

01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
there in this most recent program review
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
we did receive
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
at least one comment that
 
01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.330 align:start position:0%
at least one comment that
um

01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
those should be included in the program
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
and should have to buy allowances to
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
cover their CO2 emissions and that's
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
under review
 
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
um in the program review process but um
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
generally New Hampshire is regarded
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
biomass is carbon neutral not all states
 
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
do Massachusetts does not
 
01:43:56.209 --> 01:43:56.219 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Wendy
 
01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for being here this is
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
a good presentation the one dollar that
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
goes to Reggie can you um tell me how
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
that translates to energy cost wise to
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
Energy savings
 
01:44:14.050 --> 01:44:14.060 align:start position:0%
so there was a formula one dollar equals
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
so much savings
 
01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.970 align:start position:0%
so much savings
um

01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
so if it is spent on Energy Efficiency
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's been studies in the past that
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
investment in Energy Efficiency saves in
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
the long run
 
01:44:34.139 --> 01:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
the long run
um

01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
two to three dollars probably for every
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
dollar spent
 
01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.609 align:start position:0%
dollar spent
um

01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:42.649 --> 01:44:42.659 align:start position:0%
if it's rebated
 
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
to repairs then they get that
 
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
well the dollar portion isn't rebated
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
but the other portion that's rebated
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
they get that amount of money rebated I
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
was referring to the Energy Efficiency
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much thank you
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions or did you
 
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
have one representative McGee
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGee hi Joe this is just
 
01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.219 align:start position:0%
for clarification I had heard that one
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the reasons to not get out of the
 
01:45:15.649 --> 01:45:15.659 align:start position:0%
Reggie program is that states that are
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
part of the program continue to have to
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
pay even if they're not gaining benefits
 
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
from the program is that one of the
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
reasons that New Jersey got back in I
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
just was wondering how to view that
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
um not so much New Jersey that's true of
 
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
New England because New England has a
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
regional power pool and so you know if
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire drops out of the New
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
England region you still have five other
 
01:45:45.370 --> 01:45:45.380 align:start position:0%
states certainly Massachusetts is
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share of that
 
01:45:48.119 --> 01:45:48.649 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share of that
um

01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't impact electric rates uh
 
01:45:55.930 --> 01:45:55.940 align:start position:0%
very much for New Hampshire
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
New Jersey
 
01:45:58.500 --> 01:45:59.209 align:start position:0%
New Jersey
um

01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
I think got back in because they
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
recognized that action is needed on on
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
climate and they are part of the pjm
 
01:46:12.169 --> 01:46:12.179 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Jersey Maryland which but
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's larger than that power pool
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
some of the states in that power pool
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
are in some are out so it doesn't really
 
01:46:24.970 --> 01:46:24.980 align:start position:0%
that that same uh
 
01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
hypothesis or reasoning doesn't apply to
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
them as much as it does in New Hampshire
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
so follow-up yeah the follow-up is so
 
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
does that mean that we would still
 
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
continue to pay if we pulled out and not
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
receive the benefit is that accurate or
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
right so I mean
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
they're being
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
imperceptible decrease probably in
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New England electricity
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
rates if if New Hampshire pulled out and
 
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
we would not get this
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
you know last year
 
01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
43 million dollars in Revenue
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
so we would not be able to do either
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency or rate payer rebates
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
which you know Advantage New Hampshire
 
01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:19.430 align:start position:0%
which you know Advantage New Hampshire
repairs

01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very much it's been
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
a very informative presentation as usual
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
by the department we really appreciate
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
you being here today
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm sure you'll be back to
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
testify on specific bills we'll look
 
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing you then
 
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
the committee will now go into recess
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
until one o'clock at which time we'll
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
have a presentation by The Joint
 
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
utilities eversource Unitil and Liberty
 
01:47:50.689 --> 01:47:50.699 align:start position:0%
followed by a presentation by the New
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op so we will be
 
03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is your one minute warning we'll
 
03:03:07.429 --> 03:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.469 --> 03:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
okay everyone if you please take your
 
03:03:09.479 --> 03:03:12.830 align:start position:0%
okay everyone if you please take your
seats

03:03:12.830 --> 03:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:18.889 --> 03:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
this meeting of the science technology
 
03:03:22.429 --> 03:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
and energy committee we had a lengthy
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
presentation this morning from the
 
03:03:26.690 --> 03:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:03:28.670 --> 03:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
and now we will continue this afternoon
 
03:03:31.849 --> 03:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
with some presentations from the
 
03:03:35.929 --> 03:03:35.939 align:start position:0%
electric utilities who serve our state
 
03:03:39.469 --> 03:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
we'll start out with a presentation of
 
03:03:39.479 --> 03:03:42.349 align:start position:0%
we'll start out with a presentation of
uh

03:03:42.349 --> 03:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:46.250 --> 03:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
the four utilities led by eversource
 
03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
and I will ask Mr locata to come forward
 
03:03:54.349 --> 03:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
and Mr Foley and begin our presentations
 
03:03:56.990 --> 03:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
before we start there I will make one
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
other quick announcement this morning I
 
03:03:59.279 --> 03:04:00.410 align:start position:0%
other quick announcement this morning I
said

03:04:00.410 --> 03:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:04:03.050 --> 03:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
or I reported to you that ISO New
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
England might not be here on Thursday
 
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
due to a an illness situation I
 
03:04:11.450 --> 03:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
confirmed just a few minutes ago that
 
03:04:13.849 --> 03:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
they will in fact be here on Thursday
 
03:04:16.429 --> 03:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
morning so ISO New England will be here
 
03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
Thursday morning at 10 30. and the New
 
03:04:22.250 --> 03:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
England power generators will be here at
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
one o'clock in the afternoon
 
03:04:27.170 --> 03:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
so with that announcement I'll now turn
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
the floor over to Mr locata
 
03:04:33.230 --> 03:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh thank you chairman
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
Vose uh members of the committee Michael
 
03:04:38.030 --> 03:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
Licata uh representing eversource energy
 
03:04:40.969 --> 03:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
again uh before you
 
03:04:43.190 --> 03:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
um with me is Doug Foley who's the
 
03:04:45.230 --> 03:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
President of Operations here in New
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we really appreciate the
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the invitation of the
 
03:04:51.889 --> 03:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
committee to come in and give some
 
03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
background information on how utilities
 
03:04:58.730 --> 03:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
operate we usually do this jointly with
 
03:05:01.610 --> 03:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
the other utilities this year we sort of
 
03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
broke it up so you'll be hearing from
 
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
from all the different utility companies
 
03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
distribution utility companies electric
 
03:05:11.389 --> 03:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
and gas and we really view this as the
 
03:05:13.550 --> 03:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
start of a conversation with all of you
 
03:05:17.450 --> 03:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
we know you have uh I guess 42 bills uh
 
03:05:20.090 --> 03:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
before you this year and we really hope
 
03:05:23.090 --> 03:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
to be a constructive voice and uh and uh
 
03:05:25.730 --> 03:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
Aid and sort of a resource for you as
 
03:05:27.469 --> 03:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
you consider those public policy
 
03:05:29.929 --> 03:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
discussions so with that I'll turn it
 
03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
over to Doug Foley we're going to take
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
through a presentation and as we go
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
please feel free to interrupt and ask
 
03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
questions as we work through the slide
 
03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
questions as we work through the slide
deck

03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
deck
 
03:05:45.170 --> 03:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
03:05:48.230 --> 03:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you um chairman and the
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee here for allowing us the
 
03:05:52.849 --> 03:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to share you know a view
 
03:05:54.889 --> 03:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
of eversource and the electric utility
 
03:05:57.530 --> 03:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as might get
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
indicated my name is Doug Foley I've
 
03:06:02.230 --> 03:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
been in the industry for over 33 years
 
03:06:05.450 --> 03:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
similar background that I have I've been
 
03:06:07.849 --> 03:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
in operations those 33 years working
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
with our field crews in Massachusetts
 
03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
forever Source
 
03:06:15.170 --> 03:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
worked with the the overhead and
 
03:06:17.389 --> 03:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
underground line workers a substation so
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
really run the whole full gamut of our
 
03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the electric utility business also
 
03:06:24.170 --> 03:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
serve the capacity as an Incident
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
Commander in Mass for the last 10 years
 
03:06:28.969 --> 03:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
for major storms and major events and I
 
03:06:30.769 --> 03:06:30.779 align:start position:0%
have a similar responsibilities here in
 
03:06:32.210 --> 03:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:06:32.220 --> 03:06:34.730 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
sorry

03:06:34.730 --> 03:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want the screens on
 
03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
chairman we did plug in I don't know how
 
03:06:41.090 --> 03:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
to do that though
 
03:06:42.769 --> 03:06:42.779 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's just a remote over
 
03:06:45.950 --> 03:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
here Chris Christie can you help uh
 
03:06:48.650 --> 03:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
sorry I just noticed get them fired up
 
03:06:50.990 --> 03:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
I wondered why the screens were dark I
 
03:06:53.090 --> 03:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
assumed that you had chosen that uh
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:03.840 --> 03:07:06.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:06.479 --> 03:07:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
we can see it okay
 
03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
all right so um just a a high level
 
03:07:20.809 --> 03:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
overview of of eversource so we
 
03:07:20.819 --> 03:07:21.889 align:start position:0%
overview of of eversource so we
um

03:07:21.889 --> 03:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
serve uh the distribution customers here
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire about 70 of the
 
03:07:29.450 --> 03:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
distribution customers so it's about 50
 
03:07:29.460 --> 03:07:31.370 align:start position:0%
distribution customers so it's about 50
540

03:07:31.370 --> 03:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
540
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
000 uh retail customers and serving over
 
03:07:36.530 --> 03:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
211 communities here in the granite
 
03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:38.090 align:start position:0%
211 communities here in the granite
state

03:07:38.090 --> 03:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to get into a little more
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
details on my next slide but we have
 
03:07:43.570 --> 03:07:43.580 align:start position:0%
about 14 000 miles of distribution
 
03:07:46.130 --> 03:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
overhead infrastructure with a little
 
03:07:48.170 --> 03:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
bit of underground infrastructure here
 
03:07:51.290 --> 03:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
in the Manchester and Concord area we
 
03:07:52.969 --> 03:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
have about a thousand miles of
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
transmission and the difference between
 
03:07:57.290 --> 03:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission is it's
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
its voltage and I'll talk about that in
 
03:08:02.510 --> 03:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the next slide we have about a
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
hundred substations that essentially
 
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
converts high voltage power to usable
 
03:08:13.010 --> 03:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
power across the granite state in about
 
03:08:16.610 --> 03:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
300 000 polls that we own eversource
 
03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
zones across the granite state of course
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
CCI and the other utilities that joining
 
03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
me here also own some similar
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in this service territory
 
03:08:29.170 --> 03:08:29.180 align:start position:0%
on eversource covers 5600 square miles
 
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
and across the state we have five
 
03:08:33.769 --> 03:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
reporting locations or area work centers
 
03:08:36.170 --> 03:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
where not only the line workers show up
 
03:08:38.450 --> 03:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
and they're Associated uh supervisors
 
03:08:41.210 --> 03:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
but we also have inventory engineering
 
03:08:45.230 --> 03:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
customer reps also report regionally
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
our headquarters is in Manchester that's
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
where I reside and we also have uh
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
distribution system there uh dispatch
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
system which is both uh bulk which is
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
our transmission voltage and we also
 
03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
have a distribution voltage uh
 
03:09:02.809 --> 03:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
distribution system in Manchester and
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
that that group has the responsibility
 
03:09:08.269 --> 03:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
to operate they have full visibility of
 
03:09:13.210 --> 03:09:13.220 align:start position:0%
both Systems 24 7 and then they operate
 
03:09:15.290 --> 03:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
equipment that we have out in the field
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh real time so for instance if there
 
03:09:20.210 --> 03:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
was a an outage in a particular area or
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
there was a poll struck the First
 
03:09:24.650 --> 03:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
Responders for that Community would
 
03:09:26.929 --> 03:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
would call in to either our call center
 
03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
The Dispatch Center and those folks in
 
03:09:31.250 --> 03:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
the Dispatch Center will do some remote
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
switching and then also dispatch align
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
crew out there to make the repairs in
 
03:09:36.230 --> 03:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
real time
 
03:09:38.690 --> 03:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we have about 1500
 
03:09:40.429 --> 03:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
employees that support the New Hampshire
 
03:09:43.010 --> 03:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
operation in the in the families of uh
 
03:09:45.410 --> 03:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
of eversource
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know just kind of a high view of the
 
03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
electric uh Network and I'm sure
 
03:09:53.809 --> 03:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
everybody is well aware that um back a
 
03:09:56.450 --> 03:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
few years ago we divested of all our
 
03:09:58.490 --> 03:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
generating responsibility so we buy the
 
03:10:01.269 --> 03:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
power off off the market
 
03:10:05.210 --> 03:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
so essentially for for us the the system
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
is broken up into into three major
 
03:10:09.969 --> 03:10:09.979 align:start position:0%
components you have the transmission
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure which is the uh the
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
taller polls on the right-of-ways that
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
operate at a higher voltage typically at
 
03:10:23.570 --> 03:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
69 000 up to 345 000 kilovolts
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
and then those have the ability to
 
03:10:29.929 --> 03:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
travel long distances and input power
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
into into the region here in New
 
03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:33.889 align:start position:0%
into into the region here in New
Hampshire

03:10:33.889 --> 03:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:10:35.150 --> 03:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
um they also
 
03:10:37.010 --> 03:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
um give us the ability to bring any
 
03:10:39.230 --> 03:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
Renewables typically Renewables that are
 
03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
being developed whether it's it's wind
 
03:10:44.330 --> 03:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
up on up in The Ridges of the mountains
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
or you know could be a solar operation
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's typically an area where there's not
 
03:10:52.730 --> 03:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of load but there is a quite a bit
 
03:10:56.030 --> 03:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
of um real estate to build different
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
generating uh DJ type infrastructure and
 
03:11:02.570 --> 03:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
we utilize those transmission lines as
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
kind of the highway to get that power
 
03:11:08.090 --> 03:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
into the load pocket where it's needed a
 
03:11:10.450 --> 03:11:10.460 align:start position:0%
substation in its basic concept
 
03:11:13.370 --> 03:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
essentially converts to higher voltage
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
and converts it to a lower voltage or a
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
distribution voltage and then we also
 
03:11:20.570 --> 03:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
use substations for some transfer
 
03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
capability both on the transmission
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
voltage system and on the distribution
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
voltage system that gives us some
 
03:11:28.910 --> 03:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
redundancy in our operation
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
but a substation then converts it to a
 
03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
distribution voltage which here in New
 
03:11:37.130 --> 03:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we run a gamut but we have 34
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
5 so 34 000 volts we have some 12 000
 
03:11:44.210 --> 03:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
volts and some four thousand volts and
 
03:11:45.530 --> 03:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
there's a few others sprinkled in
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
between but those are primarily uh
 
03:11:50.269 --> 03:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
distribution voltages and then those are
 
03:11:52.010 --> 03:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
the those are the cables and the voltage
 
03:11:57.290 --> 03:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
that run along the public way that you
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
see as you as you drive around the state
 
03:12:01.790 --> 03:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
with the Transformers that converted to
 
03:12:03.889 --> 03:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
residential and commercial and business
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
uses representative Doug Thomas has a
 
03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:11.090 align:start position:0%
uses representative Doug Thomas has a
question

03:12:11.090 --> 03:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.370 --> 03:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't see her but Wendy Thomas
 
03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
was first so representative Wendy Thomas
 
03:12:19.610 --> 03:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
you go first battle of the Thomas
 
03:12:20.809 --> 03:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
um this is just a question regarding the
 
03:12:25.070 --> 03:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
substations Across the Nation there have
 
03:12:27.230 --> 03:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
been attacks on substations have you
 
03:12:29.630 --> 03:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
increased Security on them or has that
 
03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
incurred any additional cost thank you
 
03:12:34.490 --> 03:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so the answer is so the answer is
 
03:12:38.090 --> 03:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
yes we do have a few uh substations that
 
03:12:39.950 --> 03:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
have robust physical security
 
03:12:41.809 --> 03:12:41.819 align:start position:0%
essentially walls around some of the
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but we all our substation
 
03:12:48.110 --> 03:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is is fenced in we
 
03:12:50.830 --> 03:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
routinely have our workers out there
 
03:12:53.389 --> 03:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
performing inspections and then of
 
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
course we're concerned about copycat
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
events so we get that information in
 
03:12:58.969 --> 03:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
real time and we do some due diligence
 
03:13:00.650 --> 03:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
03:13:01.490 --> 03:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
um you know do we see anything
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
suspicious or anything going on in the
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
particular areas that is a concern but
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
it is something that we continue to talk
 
03:13:09.650 --> 03:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
about both in the industry and here at
 
03:13:12.889 --> 03:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
here at eversource is that if you look
 
03:13:14.690 --> 03:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
at a couple things that are occurring
 
03:13:17.570 --> 03:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know we can know probably no longer
 
03:13:17.580 --> 03:13:18.830 align:start position:0%
you know we can know probably no longer
protect

03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
protect
 
03:13:20.929 --> 03:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
substation infrastructure which is
 
03:13:23.630 --> 03:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
simply a chain link fence in the case in
 
03:13:25.490 --> 03:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
Washington in the case in South Carolina
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
and then there's the case in Metcalf
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
California is
 
03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:31.010 align:start position:0%
California is
um

03:13:31.010 --> 03:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:33.650 --> 03:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
you know customers or folks that want to
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
do harm to the economy you know can
 
03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
simply just use a rifle and shoot
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
through the and shoot through the
 
03:13:41.389 --> 03:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
equipment in one of those bulk
 
03:13:43.309 --> 03:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
Transformers in general if you've driven
 
03:13:45.170 --> 03:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
by one of our substations it's probably
 
03:13:48.410 --> 03:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
a 24-month lead time to get that
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
material in so we all have spares on the
 
03:13:55.309 --> 03:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
property maybe one or two and as I
 
03:13:57.050 --> 03:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there's you can't have
 
03:13:58.670 --> 03:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
a spare for all the different voltage
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
classifications that we have but it is a
 
03:14:03.769 --> 03:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
little problematic if um if there was
 
03:14:05.690 --> 03:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
some sabotage so it's one of these
 
03:14:07.370 --> 03:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
things we're saying hey is there
 
03:14:08.690 --> 03:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
something different we should be doing
 
03:14:10.490 --> 03:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
in regards to physical security going
 
03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:11.570 align:start position:0%
in regards to physical security going
forward

03:14:11.570 --> 03:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:14:13.210 --> 03:14:13.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
question now thank you Mr chairman thank
 
03:14:18.410 --> 03:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
um as you probably can aware of the the
 
03:14:22.610 --> 03:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
elf in the room here is the high price
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
of uh electricity but I I'd like to ask
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
a specific and I'm sure you'll cover
 
03:14:29.929 --> 03:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
that later but I would like to ask a
 
03:14:31.730 --> 03:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
question involving the transmission
 
03:14:35.389 --> 03:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
costs for for a long time we've heard
 
03:14:38.690 --> 03:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
people say that you know eversource is a
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
transmission costs are way too high
 
03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:43.010 align:start position:0%
transmission costs are way too high
um

03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have you speak to that
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
presumption and also what really is
 
03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
entailed in the cost of a transmission
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
to to the residential rate payer yeah
 
03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas and I'm
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
happy to to answer that one and
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
obviously Doug can can add his thoughts
 
03:15:03.710 --> 03:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
so when you look at
 
03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
um a customer's bill and the different
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh charges they have to pay on a monthly
 
03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:10.190 align:start position:0%
uh charges they have to pay on a monthly
basis

03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you know transmission accounts for
 
03:15:15.130 --> 03:15:15.140 align:start position:0%
about seven percent of their bill
 
03:15:19.690 --> 03:15:19.700 align:start position:0%
transmission is regulated by uh the ferc
 
03:15:22.969 --> 03:15:22.979 align:start position:0%
through ISO New England who you'll have
 
03:15:26.090 --> 03:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
in here on Thursday and
 
03:15:30.349 --> 03:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
you know that charge uh on a percentage
 
03:15:33.650 --> 03:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
basis has has increased quite a bit over
 
03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
the past decade or so and one of the
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for that or one of the drivers
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
um is the uh retirement of a significant
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
amount of generation at the same time
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
and so investments in transmission allow
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
for the efficient movement of power
 
03:15:56.210 --> 03:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
around the region to try to account for
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
that loss of generation in specific
 
03:16:02.330 --> 03:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
areas that coupled with
 
03:16:02.340 --> 03:16:02.929 align:start position:0%
areas that coupled with
um

03:16:02.929 --> 03:16:02.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know the age of the system and
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
the need for Investments to uh continue
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
improvements in reliability so while the
 
03:16:16.190 --> 03:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
increase in the overall percentage of uh
 
03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
of costs on a customer's bill you know
 
03:16:22.370 --> 03:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
increasing uh transmission charges has
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
gone up and up considerably it still
 
03:16:28.730 --> 03:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
accounts for a relatively small piece of
 
03:16:31.429 --> 03:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
a customer's bill by comparison the
 
03:16:33.290 --> 03:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
Energy Service rate the default service
 
03:16:37.010 --> 03:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
rate is around 67 percent of a
 
03:16:38.469 --> 03:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
customer's bill
 
03:16:41.929 --> 03:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure folks are aware
 
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
um eversource is one of three
 
03:16:45.530 --> 03:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
transmission providers who operate in
 
03:16:47.690 --> 03:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh the other
 
03:16:49.910 --> 03:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
two being National Grid and New
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire transmission is a subsidiary
 
03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
of next era which operates around
 
03:17:01.210 --> 03:17:01.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:04.849 --> 03:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
continue up Mr Summers representative
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
Summers has a question thank you Mr
 
03:17:07.670 --> 03:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
chairman it's not a question I was going
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
to see if they had a copy of their slide
 
03:17:11.330 --> 03:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
deck for for me
 
03:17:13.370 --> 03:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
I I you know I thought I had put them up
 
03:17:17.690 --> 03:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
there but if not I apologize okay
 
03:17:20.210 --> 03:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
sorry I got I got it wrong one thank you
 
03:17:22.610 --> 03:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we do have some extras up
 
03:17:24.889 --> 03:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
here as well
 
03:17:27.889 --> 03:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
right and uh just to sort of round out
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
this slide
 
03:17:31.730 --> 03:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
um as Doug had mentioned uh through
 
03:17:33.650 --> 03:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
electric restructuring the company has
 
03:17:35.870 --> 03:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
divested of its generation resources
 
03:17:38.090 --> 03:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
you'll have uh New England power
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
generators Association uh in on Thursday
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
which can speak to their third party
 
03:17:46.429 --> 03:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
ownership of generation we just talked
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
about transmission and really the focus
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
um presentation today is is on the
 
03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
distribution system
 
03:18:02.450 --> 03:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'll just
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know I'll just add one point
 
03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:07.490 align:start position:0%
you know I'll just add one point
um

03:18:07.490 --> 03:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know and it's depicted here in this
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
graphic but the you you know all
 
03:18:14.809 --> 03:18:14.819 align:start position:0%
electric utilities used to be vertically
 
03:18:17.570 --> 03:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
integrated so we would propose to build
 
03:18:19.490 --> 03:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
generation to serve the load or the
 
03:18:21.230 --> 03:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
forecast the load or meticulate region
 
03:18:23.050 --> 03:18:23.060 align:start position:0%
so typically from the generating plant
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
higher voltage larger wire bigger
 
03:18:27.410 --> 03:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure all the way out to where
 
03:18:30.410 --> 03:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
the load is you know and as uh
 
03:18:33.050 --> 03:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
generation uh plants have retired in the
 
03:18:35.150 --> 03:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
region it puts more Reliance on the
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
transmission infrastructure in order to
 
03:18:39.530 --> 03:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
move that that that electricity around
 
03:18:41.690 --> 03:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
not only New Hampshire but the entire
 
03:18:43.250 --> 03:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
region because we are interconnected
 
03:18:44.929 --> 03:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
which you'll learn more about on
 
03:18:47.769 --> 03:18:47.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:49.809 --> 03:18:49.819 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so since you brought up the load
 
03:18:55.250 --> 03:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
there's loss in the transmission lines
 
03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
and in the distribution lines uh how
 
03:19:00.170 --> 03:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
does that correspond to just the the
 
03:19:03.530 --> 03:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
actual demand load
 
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know what opposcent losses
 
03:19:07.849 --> 03:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
are that's something you know we could
 
03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
take back as an action but certainly you
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
know all electrical equipment in the
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
transmission distribution substation is
 
03:19:19.010 --> 03:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
associated losses uh with the way you
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
magnetized a
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
you know the the Transformer itself so
 
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I think we have information like that
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
in the frick form one I just don't have
 
03:19:28.610 --> 03:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
it memorized but we can Circle back with
 
03:19:28.620 --> 03:19:31.250 align:start position:0%
it memorized but we can Circle back with
this

03:19:31.250 --> 03:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:31.260 --> 03:19:32.929 align:start position:0%
 
great

03:19:32.929 --> 03:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide so you know
 
03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
one of uh I like to say a major goal if
 
03:19:40.190 --> 03:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
folks say well what do you do for a
 
03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:41.450 align:start position:0%
folks say well what do you do for a
living

03:19:41.450 --> 03:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
living
 
03:19:44.389 --> 03:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
um and what I like to to share is that
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
essentially my responsibility and my
 
03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh within the operation
 
03:19:52.849 --> 03:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
is to to make sure that the lights don't
 
03:19:56.090 --> 03:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
go out so we continually do inspections
 
03:19:57.889 --> 03:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
and maintenance and make sure the
 
03:19:59.929 --> 03:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
infrastructure not only is reliable but
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
resilient for for any particular storms
 
03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
and when the lights do go out I think
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's two important pieces one is we
 
03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
want to restore as quickly as possible
 
03:20:11.690 --> 03:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
and as important we want to get
 
03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
information to our customers as quickly
 
03:20:16.969 --> 03:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
as possible and I'll talk about the
 
03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
communication piece in a minute
 
03:20:22.370 --> 03:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
but over on the over on the quadrant on
 
03:20:24.010 --> 03:20:24.020 align:start position:0%
the right hand side
 
03:20:26.929 --> 03:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
eversource there's a bunch of Matrix
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we that we track as an industry and
 
03:20:33.290 --> 03:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
also at eversource but in 2016 our
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
customers in New Hampshire averaged
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
about One Outage every nine months
 
03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
and as of the close of business in
 
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
December our customers are experiencing
 
03:20:45.469 --> 03:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
outage every 20 months
 
03:20:48.769 --> 03:20:48.779 align:start position:0%
and then when the lights do go out we
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
measure that outage in minutes
 
03:20:55.250 --> 03:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
and again in 19 and 2016 we're about 132
 
03:20:58.130 --> 03:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
minutes per outage and now we're a
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
little bit over an hour at 63 minutes
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
so what do we do to to get that type of
 
03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
so what do we do to to get that type of
performance

03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
performance
 
03:21:08.210 --> 03:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's just doing some
 
03:21:11.330 --> 03:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
fundamental inspection and repairs of
 
03:21:13.190 --> 03:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
the distribution and transmission assets
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
but in this case we'll talk about
 
03:21:17.330 --> 03:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
distribution so the wooden poles the
 
03:21:17.340 --> 03:21:18.130 align:start position:0%
distribution so the wooden poles the
wire

03:21:18.130 --> 03:21:18.140 align:start position:0%
wire
 
03:21:21.530 --> 03:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
very important to replace
 
03:21:24.530 --> 03:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
um the polls with uh as they Decay over
 
03:21:28.130 --> 03:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:30.530 --> 03:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
um increase the type of wire the way we
 
03:21:32.990 --> 03:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
construct our poles traditionally we
 
03:21:35.469 --> 03:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
have like an open wire type construction
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
we use a a more compact type
 
03:21:41.150 --> 03:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
construction that makes it robust during
 
03:21:45.050 --> 03:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
wind storms and the ability to um
 
03:21:47.570 --> 03:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
to repel any limbs that that come down
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
from from above and I have a slide on on
 
03:21:52.550 --> 03:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
vegetation in a minute
 
03:21:52.560 --> 03:21:54.110 align:start position:0%
vegetation in a minute
um

03:21:54.110 --> 03:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:56.510 --> 03:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
but I think the customer experience fuel
 
03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
outages as a result of all of these
 
03:22:01.130 --> 03:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
types of Investments and when we do
 
03:22:03.889 --> 03:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
communicate to the customers we give
 
03:22:05.710 --> 03:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
everybody an ETR
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
that comes from our Dispatch Center so
 
03:22:10.670 --> 03:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
when a call comes in the dispatcher can
 
03:22:12.410 --> 03:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
see it in real time using some of these
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
smart switches they're able to send that
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
information out to the cab of the truck
 
03:22:20.809 --> 03:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
right to our First Responders and then
 
03:22:23.330 --> 03:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
they um they arrive on the job site and
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
they establish what repairs are going to
 
03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
be needed and send that information back
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
to dispatch Center and then we share
 
03:22:31.190 --> 03:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
that on our website to our particular
 
03:22:33.050 --> 03:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
customers letting them know when the
 
03:22:37.269 --> 03:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:39.769 --> 03:22:39.779 align:start position:0%
you know vegetation
 
03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
um is the number one cause trees is the
 
03:22:44.690 --> 03:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
number one cause of outages here in in
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
um as I think you all know New Hampshire
 
03:22:50.450 --> 03:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
is the second most forested uh covered
 
03:22:52.730 --> 03:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
state in the in the country so there are
 
03:22:55.490 --> 03:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
quite a few trees we're on a five-year
 
03:22:58.130 --> 03:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
cycle so we go out and all our
 
03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
distribution infrastructure we inspect
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
and travel it down every five years and
 
03:23:07.130 --> 03:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
do a do a major trim and our goal is to
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
to look up and eliminate some of that
 
03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
canopy so when it we do get these windy
 
03:23:15.170 --> 03:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
days the there's a higher probability
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we won't see any any limbs come
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
down and then on an annual basis we do
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
remove about 15 000 hazardous trees so
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
these are trees that are either diseased
 
03:23:28.250 --> 03:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
or at the end of life that could fall
 
03:23:30.530 --> 03:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
down at a windstorm and then take down
 
03:23:32.750 --> 03:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure you know and one
 
03:23:34.849 --> 03:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
thing that's that's interesting to point
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
out is that we have miles and miles of
 
03:23:39.710 --> 03:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
of circuit and a circuit itself could go
 
03:23:43.490 --> 03:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
for tens of miles and you know we want
 
03:23:45.410 --> 03:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
to trim the entire circuit but we could
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
if we get refusals from a particular
 
03:23:49.849 --> 03:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
customer to do some trimming around
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
their particular home or a business you
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
know that one limb could impact all
 
03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
those customers on that particular
 
03:23:58.849 --> 03:23:58.859 align:start position:0%
circuit so you know we're
 
03:24:01.670 --> 03:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
I think my I think my um my point to
 
03:24:03.650 --> 03:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
this particular side is vegetation
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
management is as important of all the
 
03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
electrical infrastructure that we
 
03:24:10.490 --> 03:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
maintain invest in on the distribution
 
03:24:12.429 --> 03:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
and transmission system
 
03:24:14.929 --> 03:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a quick
 
03:24:17.150 --> 03:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh my questions on the previous slide
 
03:24:21.889 --> 03:24:21.899 align:start position:0%
where it said that 47 of customer
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
outages are restored in under five
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
minutes from the control room and I'm
 
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
curious how how what what's done for
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is this just rerouting power
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
through some redundant circuit yeah no
 
03:24:36.410 --> 03:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank that thank you it's actually a
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's actually a great question and a
 
03:24:41.389 --> 03:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
great story so back in 2016 if you think
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
about the distribution infrastructure
 
03:24:45.590 --> 03:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the infrastructure you see as
 
03:24:47.210 --> 03:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
you drive to and from work and drive
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
from your home
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
we had back in 2016 about 80 what I'll
 
03:24:54.290 --> 03:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
call Smart switches so these are devices
 
03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
out on the pole tops that give
 
03:24:58.969 --> 03:24:58.979 align:start position:0%
information back to the Dispatch Center
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
in regards to voltage current and then
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
any fault that may occur like a struck
 
03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
Pole or a tree limb coming down over the
 
03:25:12.650 --> 03:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
years we've added up to just recently
 
03:25:15.769 --> 03:25:15.779 align:start position:0%
we're at about a little over 1800 spot
 
03:25:18.530 --> 03:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
switches that are that are in the air so
 
03:25:20.330 --> 03:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
utilizing the control center at
 
03:25:23.769 --> 03:25:23.779 align:start position:0%
Manchester our dispatches have real-time
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
information in regards to power flow and
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the system so they
 
03:25:31.490 --> 03:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
have the ability to reroute power in the
 
03:25:33.889 --> 03:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
event of a fault like a tree limb coming
 
03:25:33.899 --> 03:25:34.809 align:start position:0%
event of a fault like a tree limb coming
down

03:25:34.809 --> 03:25:34.819 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
and as a result of them
 
03:25:40.010 --> 03:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
rerouting the power and using the
 
03:25:42.050 --> 03:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
Investments that we've made just using
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
technology we're able to restore almost
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
50 percent of our of our outages are
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
within five minutes
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
then then what we do is we pinpoint with
 
03:25:53.570 --> 03:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
that information we can pinpoint exactly
 
03:25:55.969 --> 03:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
between two devices where we believe the
 
03:25:58.190 --> 03:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
fault is and then dispatch our line
 
03:26:00.170 --> 03:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
workers out there to make the repairs
 
03:26:00.180 --> 03:26:01.670 align:start position:0%
workers out there to make the repairs
follow-up

03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:26:04.370 --> 03:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
um given that you have the smart
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
switches and the smart switches are
 
03:26:10.130 --> 03:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
communicating this information why do
 
03:26:12.410 --> 03:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
humans even need to be in that Loop
 
03:26:14.929 --> 03:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry why do humans even need to be
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
in that Loop
 
03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:18.410 align:start position:0%
in that Loop
so

03:26:18.410 --> 03:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:19.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:21.650 --> 03:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
so I think humans at the end of the day
 
03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the repairs or
 
03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:24.889 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the repairs or
dispatch

03:26:24.889 --> 03:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
dispatch
 
03:26:27.530 --> 03:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
information so I'm talking about the
 
03:26:29.450 --> 03:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
actual repairs right because the smart
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
switches have the information they they
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
report that there's a fault yep and
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
there's a human making a decision as to
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
how to handle that fault that seems like
 
03:26:39.530 --> 03:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
something that could be done
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
automatically and much faster without
 
03:26:43.370 --> 03:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
even getting a human involved yep no
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
great question so
 
03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
um our design philosophy is to put a
 
03:26:50.269 --> 03:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
switch in between every 500 customers so
 
03:26:52.130 --> 03:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
when we isolate a fault that's between
 
03:26:54.769 --> 03:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
two devices or two smart switches on
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
average it's going to impact 500
 
03:26:56.460 --> 03:26:57.530 align:start position:0%
average it's going to impact 500
customers

03:26:57.530 --> 03:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
customers
 
03:26:59.510 --> 03:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
but the smart switches have the ability
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
to do what referred to as self-healing
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
so they know what the power flow looks
 
03:27:07.670 --> 03:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
like very quickly they can sense where
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
the fault is they can open off and close
 
03:27:13.130 --> 03:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
in and reroute the power without our
 
03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
dispatches doing anything and our
 
03:27:18.050 --> 03:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
dispatchers can view it real time on the
 
03:27:20.330 --> 03:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
computer screen but then they'll need to
 
03:27:22.610 --> 03:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
dispatch a line worker out to make the
 
03:27:26.769 --> 03:27:26.779 align:start position:0%
repairs to make the physical repairs
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question
 
03:27:31.849 --> 03:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:27:33.530 --> 03:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question on your vegetation
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
page you have on your last bullet item
 
03:27:38.750 --> 03:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
an individual refusal can cause an
 
03:27:41.750 --> 03:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
outage what is a refusal so we work
 
03:27:44.450 --> 03:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
closely with the the tree ones and the
 
03:27:46.610 --> 03:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities and you know some
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
customers just love their trees and it
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
may not be a tree that is in the public
 
03:27:53.570 --> 03:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
right away it could be a tree that's in
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
on private property that could pose a
 
03:27:58.490 --> 03:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
threat to not only to their flow of
 
03:28:00.530 --> 03:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
power but all the customers on that
 
03:28:02.809 --> 03:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
particular circuit and it's really just
 
03:28:05.210 --> 03:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
illustrating a point that
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
um you know the support of the
 
03:28:08.450 --> 03:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
communities and the tree world is a very
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
important to ensure that we have a
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
reliable distribution system you know as
 
03:28:14.570 --> 03:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
I pointed out in the first bullet tree
 
03:28:17.210 --> 03:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
related outages uh the number one cause
 
03:28:18.769 --> 03:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
for all the good work we're doing it's
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
the number one cause to our outages we
 
03:28:24.050 --> 03:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
average about a hundred blank tree Crews
 
03:28:26.030 --> 03:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know in order to do a five-year
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
cycle it's about a hundred tree Crews
 
03:28:32.090 --> 03:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
every day while doing the needed tree
 
03:28:35.630 --> 03:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
trimming just to keep up with vegetation
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
and actually just to add to that it was
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
a point I was going to make as I think
 
03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:44.269 align:start position:0%
a point I was going to make as I think
um

03:28:44.269 --> 03:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:46.130 --> 03:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who have been
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
here uh in the past know that tree
 
03:28:53.090 --> 03:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
trimming customer notice can often be a
 
03:28:57.170 --> 03:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
passionate and Hot Topic so we
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
follow the puc rules on notifications
 
03:29:03.290 --> 03:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
and what trees were allowed to trim uh
 
03:29:05.570 --> 03:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
but you know they're
 
03:29:08.210 --> 03:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
as Doug said uh folks love their trees
 
03:29:11.690 --> 03:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
and so as you get constituent concerns
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
and and questions you know please feel
 
03:29:15.889 --> 03:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
free to to direct them to us we're happy
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
to um uh to try to provide a response uh
 
03:29:23.210 --> 03:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
as as best we can to any issues that may
 
03:29:25.550 --> 03:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
arise and I I should have said this
 
03:29:28.670 --> 03:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
earlier in the um presentation but uh
 
03:29:30.170 --> 03:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
you know Doug and I are presenting
 
03:29:33.170 --> 03:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
eversource information and figures
 
03:29:36.530 --> 03:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of these programs are uh
 
03:29:38.510 --> 03:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
true across all of the utilities
 
03:29:41.809 --> 03:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
investments in smart switches and and
 
03:29:44.570 --> 03:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
the grid vegetation management uh so
 
03:29:47.210 --> 03:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
we're providing our story but uh it's
 
03:29:48.889 --> 03:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
again I'm sure you don't want to hear
 
03:29:50.510 --> 03:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
every utility come up here and say the
 
03:29:52.849 --> 03:29:52.859 align:start position:0%
same thing over again so we're a bit
 
03:29:54.530 --> 03:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative on this as they will be
 
03:29:57.729 --> 03:29:57.739 align:start position:0%
on other programs as well
 
03:29:59.929 --> 03:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
03:30:04.130 --> 03:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
um the these smart switches I understand
 
03:30:06.290 --> 03:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
that they alert you for any kind of an
 
03:30:09.170 --> 03:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
outage are they also used in planning
 
03:30:09.180 --> 03:30:12.110 align:start position:0%
outage are they also used in planning
distribution

03:30:12.110 --> 03:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:13.969 --> 03:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
are they used in distribution planning
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
03:30:18.410 --> 03:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
how much goes where
 
03:30:18.420 --> 03:30:19.309 align:start position:0%
how much goes where
yeah

03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:30:21.349 --> 03:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
um so we use them we do use them for
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
power flow in the distribution system so
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns is if we see an
 
03:30:28.729 --> 03:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
increased use in a particular area of
 
03:30:30.650 --> 03:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
the circuit depending on the physical
 
03:30:33.889 --> 03:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
wire size if it relates if there's too
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
much current or too much load in that
 
03:30:38.090 --> 03:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
particular area you could burn down some
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
wires so typically in high heat type
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
events like in the summer we might see a
 
03:30:46.190 --> 03:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
load increase on a circuit and we have
 
03:30:48.410 --> 03:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
the ability using the switches to
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
reroute power in order to make sure we
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't burn down the physical wire that's
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
in the field
 
03:30:58.010 --> 03:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:00.769 --> 03:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question
 
03:31:02.650 --> 03:31:02.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
the smart switches are they are you are
 
03:31:09.229 --> 03:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
you acquiring them as a result of POC
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
rules or is it an economic decision
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
you're making to acquire those smart
 
03:31:13.439 --> 03:31:16.010 align:start position:0%
you're making to acquire those smart
switches

03:31:16.010 --> 03:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not aware of any you want to
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
answer that first yeah I I can take a
 
03:31:22.370 --> 03:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
crack at that so
 
03:31:22.380 --> 03:31:23.630 align:start position:0%
crack at that so
um

03:31:23.630 --> 03:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:26.570 --> 03:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
traditionally the operation of the
 
03:31:30.610 --> 03:31:30.620 align:start position:0%
system and decisions around reliability
 
03:31:33.889 --> 03:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
are are something that a company makes
 
03:31:35.950 --> 03:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
the the utility makes
 
03:31:38.690 --> 03:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission then
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
through rate cases will review uh the
 
03:31:44.690 --> 03:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
prudency of those Investments so are we
 
03:31:46.610 --> 03:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know quote unquote gold plating the
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
system what is the benefit that our
 
03:31:50.990 --> 03:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
customers are receiving from those uh
 
03:31:53.389 --> 03:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
Investments is it worth that investment
 
03:31:53.399 --> 03:31:54.650 align:start position:0%
Investments is it worth that investment
so

03:31:54.650 --> 03:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:58.849 --> 03:31:58.859 align:start position:0%
um you know we operate the system we try
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
our best to make obviously prudent
 
03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
Investments That Then are subject to
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
review by the Public Utilities
 
03:32:05.570 --> 03:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
Commission and if they were to determine
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
either our reliability is not equal to
 
03:32:11.269 --> 03:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh their their standards what it should
 
03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
be then obviously we would have a
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
discussion with them or the inverse
 
03:32:17.929 --> 03:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
being you know a your reliability is
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
really good but maybe you know it's not
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
worth the the price that you're putting
 
03:32:24.170 --> 03:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
in so there's there's a balance once
 
03:32:24.180 --> 03:32:25.010 align:start position:0%
in so there's there's a balance once
there

03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:32:27.950 --> 03:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Summers has a
 
03:32:27.960 --> 03:32:29.150 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Summers has a
question

03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is just a
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
quick question on power generation and
 
03:32:35.210 --> 03:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's what the eversource of with
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve being the way it was and
 
03:32:38.809 --> 03:32:38.819 align:start position:0%
with mystic not generating any power
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
does eversource have the capability to
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
be able to increase generation in those
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
period of times or does it helps the iso
 
03:32:47.929 --> 03:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
to decide who what how much they provide
 
03:32:49.849 --> 03:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:32:53.809 --> 03:32:53.819 align:start position:0%
it really is an ISO decision in terms of
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
managing the transmission and just and
 
03:33:01.849 --> 03:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
uh generation system so during the event
 
03:33:03.769 --> 03:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
that happened on Christmas Eve we were
 
03:33:06.170 --> 03:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
communicated in close communication with
 
03:33:10.969 --> 03:33:10.979 align:start position:0%
ISO and had that situation continued to
 
03:33:13.370 --> 03:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
increase they would have directed us to
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
take certain steps to reduce load to
 
03:33:17.809 --> 03:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
make sure that the system remained
 
03:33:20.690 --> 03:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
viable but we don't have the ability to
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
bring on additional Generations since we
 
03:33:26.450 --> 03:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
don't own any generation anymore our
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
role at that point would be to reduce
 
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
load through you know what's called
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
managed outage outages
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
03:33:40.190 --> 03:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:33:42.349 --> 03:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
coming in today just a quick question on
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
the um on the vegetation management do
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
you have a program where you're um
 
03:33:51.050 --> 03:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
replacing trees that you're removing
 
03:33:53.929 --> 03:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
so uh I'd like to turn
 
03:33:53.939 --> 03:33:55.729 align:start position:0%
so uh I'd like to turn
okay

03:33:55.729 --> 03:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:57.769 --> 03:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
um so uh we
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
we try to work with the customer
 
03:34:03.950 --> 03:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
um you know if we're removing a tree
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
entirely we are arborists have a program
 
03:34:09.769 --> 03:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
called right tree right place to direct
 
03:34:12.410 --> 03:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
them to species that won't grow up into
 
03:34:14.570 --> 03:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
the line so think of like an ornamental
 
03:34:18.170 --> 03:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
crab apple versus a white pine
 
03:34:20.929 --> 03:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
um you know the company doesn't uh
 
03:34:23.690 --> 03:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
unless we violate the rules and have to
 
03:34:25.729 --> 03:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
sort of make it right uh that we don't
 
03:34:28.429 --> 03:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
pay for uh replacement trees but we do
 
03:34:30.410 --> 03:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
try to work with the customer and direct
 
03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
them to you know the Audubon Society and
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
others who uh might have have free trees
 
03:34:40.490 --> 03:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
that they're offering follow up thank
 
03:34:40.500 --> 03:34:41.389 align:start position:0%
that they're offering follow up thank
you

03:34:41.389 --> 03:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I guess that was one part of my
 
03:34:45.469 --> 03:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
question the other part was do you have
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
a program maybe it's a a little bit
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
broader where you know you're not place
 
03:34:52.370 --> 03:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
you're not planting trees on the prop at
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
the property that you remove the tree
 
03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
but maybe if you take 5 000 trees out a
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
year you're planting 5 000 trees in the
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
forest somewhere yeah so
 
03:35:06.650 --> 03:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge we do not
 
03:35:08.929 --> 03:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
have a program in place like that
 
03:35:12.729 --> 03:35:12.739 align:start position:0%
however the company does have an an
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
internal goal of carbon neutrality by
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
2030 and I know that there are
 
03:35:22.910 --> 03:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
conversations going on internally about
 
03:35:25.130 --> 03:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
a program like that we obviously take
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
down a lot of trees and or trim a lot of
 
03:35:30.769 --> 03:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
trees I should say as part of our
 
03:35:34.429 --> 03:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
reliability efforts and uh whether there
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
are opportunities to to offset that with
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
other protecting resources or planting
 
03:35:42.050 --> 03:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
new resources I know is something that
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
our sustainability group is discussing
 
03:35:47.090 --> 03:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barishni has a
 
03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barishni has a
question

03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
I guess it's more of a comment but um or
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
it could be a question
 
03:35:56.090 --> 03:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the work that they do
 
03:35:58.250 --> 03:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
with tree trimming is actually cutting a
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
tree versus tree trimming I assuming
 
03:36:01.729 --> 03:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
it's mostly tree trimming and very
 
03:36:04.190 --> 03:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
little cutting of actual trees yeah I
 
03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
would say majority of it on a percentage
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
basis is is tree trimming itself
 
03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
um as I stated earlier on that slide I
 
03:36:12.590 --> 03:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
believe it was yeah 12 to 15
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
000 what we call hazardous trees that
 
03:36:17.330 --> 03:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
were identified on an annual basis that
 
03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
we remove the entire tree and then we
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
work with as Mike had indicated the
 
03:36:23.330 --> 03:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
different communities and the tree
 
03:36:25.490 --> 03:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
wardens so we will replace some
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
vegetation and then there's good
 
03:36:28.729 --> 03:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
vegetation that typically doesn't grow
 
03:36:31.370 --> 03:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
up it grows you know in or around that
 
03:36:33.170 --> 03:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
you know Services some blockage so we
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
work with the the tree wardens to
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
identify those opportunities
 
03:36:40.190 --> 03:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a question
 
03:36:42.349 --> 03:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want a quick quick comment
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh one of my places up at the Milan area
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years we will
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
constantly for the last seven eight
 
03:36:49.490 --> 03:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
years losing power all the time and the
 
03:36:50.929 --> 03:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
work that was done there with the tree
 
03:36:53.090 --> 03:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
trimming with a 110 and all the back
 
03:36:55.849 --> 03:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
roads a b you had a tremendous amount of
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
work done up the last couple years and
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's made a huge huge difference and the
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
other thing Friday night I'm sitting at
 
03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
home and somebody hit a pole down in the
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
other part of the county I was in and uh
 
03:37:08.269 --> 03:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
they call me and says we're going to
 
03:37:10.010 --> 03:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
shut your power off in an hour
 
03:37:11.929 --> 03:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
fix it you'll be out for so long and
 
03:37:13.729 --> 03:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
then back on I've never had that call
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
ahead of time an hour before they they
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
were going to shut it off and I just
 
03:37:19.010 --> 03:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
want to say that uh this program has
 
03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
gotten better and better each year
 
03:37:22.010 --> 03:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
because we're not up in the Milan area
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
it was we were we were out at least once
 
03:37:24.650 --> 03:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
a week
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
a Wednesday a little Windstorm when we
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
were out so uh it's it's doing a really
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
good job I just want to make a quick
 
03:37:32.929 --> 03:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
comment on it no I appreciate that
 
03:37:34.610 --> 03:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative and then and the numbers
 
03:37:36.710 --> 03:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
indicate and you know we share it with
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
the with the puc and the doe but you
 
03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
know the Investments that we're making
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
are paying dividends it's keeping the
 
03:37:43.969 --> 03:37:43.979 align:start position:0%
lights on when they go out we do have
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to get them back on on
 
03:37:48.050 --> 03:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
quicker and in a slide that we have
 
03:37:49.849 --> 03:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
coming up uh we've been doing a lot of
 
03:37:51.889 --> 03:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
work and customer notification space so
 
03:37:54.410 --> 03:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
some customers like to have phone calls
 
03:37:56.210 --> 03:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
or go to the website or social media or
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
even be text so well you know I might as
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
well touch on it right now is that
 
03:38:02.279 --> 03:38:03.650 align:start position:0%
well touch on it right now is that
um

03:38:03.650 --> 03:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:05.450 --> 03:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
each one of the line workers the field
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire you know have
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
an iPad so the dispatcher can send that
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
information out to them and it
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
eliminates a phone call but though the
 
03:38:14.809 --> 03:38:14.819 align:start position:0%
line worker will go out to that location
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
identify the problem but be pride of
 
03:38:19.250 --> 03:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
making work they'll call back into the
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
dispatch and they'll establish an ETR
 
03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
and if the customer chooses to get that
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
information we push that and say hey
 
03:38:27.889 --> 03:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
we'll have your lights back on within
 
03:38:30.290 --> 03:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
two hours and oh by the way you know it
 
03:38:32.929 --> 03:38:32.939 align:start position:0%
was a it was a poll strike and then once
 
03:38:35.870 --> 03:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
we the Line crew calls back in talks to
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
the dispatcher we close out that ticket
 
03:38:40.370 --> 03:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
and then we push another notice out to
 
03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
you and say hey your light should be
 
03:38:45.290 --> 03:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
back on if it's not give us a call
 
03:38:47.450 --> 03:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
um so I appreciate your comments I've
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
been working real hard as I said earlier
 
03:38:51.769 --> 03:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
you know getting the lights back on
 
03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
communicating with the customers is
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
probably equal as important and we're
 
03:38:57.830 --> 03:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
getting similar comments like that all
 
03:38:59.410 --> 03:38:59.420 align:start position:0%
the time so thank you
 
03:39:01.610 --> 03:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm thrilled to hear that
 
03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
eversource as a company has a an
 
03:39:11.210 --> 03:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
internal goal of carbon neutrality by
 
03:39:11.220 --> 03:39:14.269 align:start position:0%
internal goal of carbon neutrality by
2030.

03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
seven years away uh that's terrific I
 
03:39:19.429 --> 03:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
assume that you're referring to your
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
internal your operations uh and I'm
 
03:39:26.570 --> 03:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
wondering if those are the values
 
03:39:26.580 --> 03:39:28.070 align:start position:0%
wondering if those are the values
underlying

03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
eversources operations corporate
 
03:39:33.650 --> 03:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
philosophy does any of that philosophy
 
03:39:33.660 --> 03:39:35.690 align:start position:0%
philosophy does any of that philosophy
uh

03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
extend to the carbon content of the
 
03:39:42.889 --> 03:39:42.899 align:start position:0%
power that you procure for all of your
 
03:39:46.729 --> 03:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
customers from the generation Fleet
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I can uh take a shot at that so
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
um that is correct it's an internal
 
03:39:55.729 --> 03:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
operational uh goal so you know think
 
03:39:57.889 --> 03:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
about our Fleet of trucks
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
um how we power our own
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
um uh buildings and Facilities
 
03:40:07.010 --> 03:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh the power that is
 
03:40:10.849 --> 03:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
provided to our customers who elect to
 
03:40:13.729 --> 03:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
take default service from us you know
 
03:40:16.010 --> 03:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
that is actually a very
 
03:40:19.429 --> 03:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
um prescriptive uh
 
03:40:22.610 --> 03:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh structure that is contained within
 
03:40:26.690 --> 03:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
State Statute as well as puc rules so
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
truly we um as you heard last week from
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy the and
 
03:40:36.410 --> 03:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the consumer Advocate every six
 
03:40:39.650 --> 03:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
months we go out and we procure power uh
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of customers who who wish to
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
take default service we get those bids
 
03:40:46.610 --> 03:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
back from the market whatever the price
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
is or the lowest cost uh makeup of that
 
03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
generation it is passed through to our
 
03:40:55.729 --> 03:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
customers now there is public policy
 
03:40:57.889 --> 03:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
that is layered on top of that whether
 
03:40:59.450 --> 03:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's the regional greenhouse gas
 
03:41:00.889 --> 03:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
initiative which you heard about from
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
03:41:05.150 --> 03:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
this morning or the renewable portfolio
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
standard so those are public policy
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
decisions that we comply with but we
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority in stature
 
03:41:16.490 --> 03:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
today to sort of go outside of that
 
03:41:19.729 --> 03:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
because it would be potentially deemed
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.090 --> 03:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
and we have several more slides to get
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
through and we know we have several more
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
utilities to get through so we'll we'll
 
03:41:34.370 --> 03:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
try to pick up our Pace to make sure
 
03:41:36.650 --> 03:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're staying on time
 
03:41:38.210 --> 03:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:40.610 --> 03:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
all right I'll uh I'll move this along
 
03:41:43.309 --> 03:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
but we do have a full-time staff um that
 
03:41:45.530 --> 03:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
is focusing on emergency response and
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
emergency response is just not storms
 
03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
but it's physical assets as we discussed
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
earlier cyber business continuity Etc
 
03:41:57.410 --> 03:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
um we utilize
 
03:41:57.420 --> 03:41:58.309 align:start position:0%
um we utilize
um

03:41:58.309 --> 03:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:00.769 --> 03:42:00.779 align:start position:0%
you know we file a plan with the doe on
 
03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
an annual basis we just made some
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
um some updates uh last week and we and
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
we did file that to New Hampshire doe we
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
used that for a similar framework across
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
the companies we use we follow the
 
03:42:15.650 --> 03:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
national Incident Management System on
 
03:42:17.530 --> 03:42:17.540 align:start position:0%
nins it's the incident command
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's used it's
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
something that was developed following
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
the first uh World Trade Center bombings
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh back in the 90s you know it allows
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
organizations both internally with
 
03:42:32.750 --> 03:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and state officials
 
03:42:35.090 --> 03:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
to communicate with like people
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
Operations Logistics planning
 
03:42:40.729 --> 03:42:40.739 align:start position:0%
Etc and then the framework that we use
 
03:42:43.250 --> 03:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
here in eversource it gives us the
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of expand our response
 
03:42:48.110 --> 03:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
to an event you know in the in the case
 
03:42:50.929 --> 03:42:50.939 align:start position:0%
of a storm very easily we can bring
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
resources up from Mass in Connecticut or
 
03:42:56.450 --> 03:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
from Mutual Aid and kind of bolted on to
 
03:42:58.969 --> 03:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
our our response plan because we have a
 
03:43:01.790 --> 03:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
consistent way we respond to system
 
03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:03.650 align:start position:0%
consistent way we respond to system
emergencies

03:43:03.650 --> 03:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know our restoration philosophy is
 
03:43:09.650 --> 03:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
is very simple it essentially has four
 
03:43:12.530 --> 03:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
steps to it we deal with first any
 
03:43:14.809 --> 03:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
life-threatening Public Safety type
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
hazards like block roads why is down
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
poles down uh trees down the ability to
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
get First Responders in those
 
03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
communities to to emergencies that's our
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
number one priority then we need to
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
re-establish the backbone make sure the
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
transmission any damage to transmission
 
03:43:33.290 --> 03:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and or the substation are
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
up and running and and functional we
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
might not have all our contingencies in
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
place but establishing that back
 
03:43:42.290 --> 03:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
backbone is is Step number two then we
 
03:43:44.510 --> 03:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
focus on critical facilities sewer
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
treatment water schools Hospital fire
 
03:43:50.450 --> 03:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
and police departments that need power
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
warming stations
 
03:43:54.530 --> 03:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
etc those critical infrastructure and
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
then we focus in on the blocks of
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
customers so the largest number of
 
03:44:00.849 --> 03:44:00.859 align:start position:0%
customers on a particular outage
 
03:44:04.010 --> 03:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
typically gets gets our gets our
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
attention and our resources first so in
 
03:44:09.050 --> 03:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
that stage in the in stage number four
 
03:44:12.130 --> 03:44:12.140 align:start position:0%
and in all of the stages we're actively
 
03:44:14.330 --> 03:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
restoring hitting critical
 
03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we're also restoring
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
primary wires down but we also have a
 
03:44:21.769 --> 03:44:21.779 align:start position:0%
group of employees and contractors that
 
03:44:24.889 --> 03:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
are focused squarely on services so tree
 
03:44:27.410 --> 03:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
limb takes down from Pole to house we
 
03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
don't wait to the end of the storm we
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
try to do those in in parallel we think
 
03:44:32.290 --> 03:44:32.300 align:start position:0%
it shaves about a day off our
 
03:44:35.469 --> 03:44:35.479 align:start position:0%
restoration curve
 
03:44:35.479 --> 03:44:37.870 align:start position:0%

about our etrs what's our restoration
 
03:44:47.690 --> 03:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
plan for for a given storm and the way
 
03:44:49.610 --> 03:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
our customers want to be communicated to
 
03:44:51.769 --> 03:44:51.779 align:start position:0%
so there's essentially many many
 
03:44:53.570 --> 03:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
different Avenues but we communicate
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
prior to an event based on the forecast
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
and what we think the threat level is
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
and we have some some models that we use
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
to help us predict the number of
 
03:45:06.050 --> 03:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
resources and durations a storm
 
03:45:08.330 --> 03:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
um might have on our system we
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
communicate during the storm all that
 
03:45:13.010 --> 03:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
critical information and then certainly
 
03:45:15.650 --> 03:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
a feedback loop at the end of the storm
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
but our customers can can call in they
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
can call into police and fire they can
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
go to our website they can opt in either
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
through emails or they could get text
 
03:45:25.800 --> 03:45:27.110 align:start position:0%
through emails or they could get text
messages

03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
messages
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
um to and from their their mobile
 
03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:30.830 align:start position:0%
um to and from their their mobile
devices

03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
devices
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
and just to add two quick notes here
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
um in additional in addition to the
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
customer Communications that Doug just
 
03:45:40.250 --> 03:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
talked about uh the company has really
 
03:45:43.010 --> 03:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
done a lot to improve Communications
 
03:45:45.710 --> 03:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
with our municipalities so that there is
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
constant feedback and updates as to what
 
03:45:52.969 --> 03:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
we're doing what our preparedness is and
 
03:45:55.130 --> 03:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
then get getting their feedback as Doug
 
03:45:57.530 --> 03:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
said on on locations of warming stations
 
03:45:59.450 --> 03:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
the the length and duration of the
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
outage and in addition to that uh I'm
 
03:46:04.849 --> 03:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
sure many of you were inundated by
 
03:46:07.250 --> 03:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
regular Communications for me during the
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
last two storms uh to your legislative
 
03:46:11.690 --> 03:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
accounts it's important for us knowing
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
that you guys are are public figures and
 
03:46:15.769 --> 03:46:15.779 align:start position:0%
your constituents will be asking you
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions to make sure you know what
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
we're doing how we're how we are
 
03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
responding and also uh what our
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
anticipated times of restoration are so
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's really a very robust program
 
03:46:30.769 --> 03:46:30.779 align:start position:0%
that we've um put a lot of time effort
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
and resources into improving over the
 
03:46:36.650 --> 03:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know in closing you know I would say
 
03:46:41.450 --> 03:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
that you know our Focus here at
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
eversource certainly my focus is to live
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
a top tier
 
03:46:47.150 --> 03:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
um service to our our customers so it's
 
03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
making sure the lights are on and then
 
03:46:50.990 --> 03:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
communicating when they when they do go
 
03:46:53.330 --> 03:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
out and we work on that every single day
 
03:46:55.610 --> 03:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
we have an operations meeting where we
 
03:46:57.290 --> 03:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
our team and Engineering get together
 
03:46:59.570 --> 03:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
every morning to look at look at how the
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
system's operating and look at any
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
potential issues that are
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
forward-looking over the next 24 hours
 
03:47:07.250 --> 03:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
we continue to make what I would
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
consider some really good Investments
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm using newer Technologies not only
 
03:47:13.849 --> 03:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
has it got the lights back on but it's
 
03:47:16.610 --> 03:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
also prevented a truck roll so if we can
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
prevent the truck roll you know lends
 
03:47:20.330 --> 03:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
itself to to the greenhouse gas
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
component because we don't have the
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
diesel truck riding on out there and
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
then we can also make sure that the work
 
03:47:28.190 --> 03:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
that we have planned for the next day
 
03:47:29.690 --> 03:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
gets accomplished because we didn't have
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
to bring resources in you know in the
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
middle of night to make that repair you
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
know I'll leave you uh kind of with one
 
03:47:35.640 --> 03:47:36.530 align:start position:0%
know I'll leave you uh kind of with one
note

03:47:36.530 --> 03:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
note
 
03:47:37.729 --> 03:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
um you know out of all the good things
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
that that we're doing in the community
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
in our presence in the community one
 
03:47:43.130 --> 03:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
thing that we're proud of and it's about
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
a six-year partnership with Manchester
 
03:47:47.150 --> 03:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
Community College but we've identified a
 
03:47:49.490 --> 03:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
need to develop the next Workforce of
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
the future and of course we have a lot
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
of co-op programs with UNH and other
 
03:47:56.090 --> 03:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
institutions and you get your
 
03:47:58.010 --> 03:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
traditional engineers and accountants
 
03:47:59.809 --> 03:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
and and those folks that make the
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
business go on but we early on developed
 
03:48:05.210 --> 03:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
the need to Homegrown here in New
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the craft workers uh the
 
03:48:10.010 --> 03:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
line workers that are going to live and
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
and work here at eversource and in New
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about six years ago we started
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
an apprentice program with a with
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester Community College we hire
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
about 30 new line workers on an annual
 
03:48:24.290 --> 03:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
basis that's my plan this year and
 
03:48:26.809 --> 03:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
starting in January a second program we
 
03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
have a Manchester Community College that
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
just got accredited it's in a substation
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
organization so it's a full associate
 
03:48:35.090 --> 03:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
degree we bolted on a couple of
 
03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
electives and when they graduate from
 
03:48:39.410 --> 03:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
that program it's one of the programs
 
03:48:42.050 --> 03:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
that they can consider revisource and we
 
03:48:44.210 --> 03:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
consider them to work in our substation
 
03:48:44.220 --> 03:48:46.130 align:start position:0%
consider them to work in our substation
group

03:48:46.130 --> 03:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:48:46.140 --> 03:48:49.370 align:start position:0%
group
foreign

03:48:49.370 --> 03:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
um eversource obviously is an electric
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
company what percentage of your truck
 
03:49:00.010 --> 03:49:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:04.370 --> 03:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
so we um I don't know the percentage but
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
I can tell you some of the things that
 
03:49:09.050 --> 03:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
that we're doing so we are we are
 
03:49:11.809 --> 03:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
electric gas and water across the three
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
states here in New Hampshire we are 100
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
electric so it all depends on the use of
 
03:49:19.190 --> 03:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
the vehicle so meter reader meter
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
reading for example they typically work
 
03:49:22.729 --> 03:49:22.739 align:start position:0%
an eight-hour shift so it could be
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
compressed natural gas or some electric
 
03:49:28.610 --> 03:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
vehicles because that lends himself to
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a one ship one shift operation
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
you could plug it in off hours and then
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
you can utilize it the next day but we
 
03:49:39.050 --> 03:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
have what I consider hybrid so a lot of
 
03:49:41.150 --> 03:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
the line trucks or all the new line
 
03:49:44.090 --> 03:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
trucks as we um you know a trip the
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
fleet they are diesel but they all have
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
a battery pack so when a crew arrives
 
03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
they drive out to the job using the
 
03:49:55.010 --> 03:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
diesel engine but when they arrive on
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
the job majority of the work if not 100
 
03:49:59.090 --> 03:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
of the work they perform that day is off
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
of the battery so so the diesel shuts
 
03:50:03.530 --> 03:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
off the line worker can Ascend and
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
descend and do all the work Associated
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
up in the poll and then you know drive
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
home on diesel at the end of the day and
 
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
that gives us ability to fully utilize
 
03:50:15.229 --> 03:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
that asset both on Bluesky endurance
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
long storm events
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes please um do you have a
 
03:50:23.090 --> 03:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
percentage of those hybrids
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's been a a really
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
good overview and I guess we have a few
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
more questions I know I have one but
 
03:50:36.769 --> 03:50:36.779 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize representative Doug
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
Thomas first
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:50:41.150 --> 03:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
um last year uh aerosaurus gave a
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
briefing uh on the iso New England
 
03:50:51.889 --> 03:50:51.899 align:start position:0%
notice of um future potentials for
 
03:50:55.849 --> 03:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
Rolling blackouts and the uh my my
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:51:00.530 --> 03:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
since then has anything changed from
 
03:51:02.690 --> 03:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
eversource's preparation on the briefing
 
03:51:06.290 --> 03:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
that they gave us and have all of the
 
03:51:07.969 --> 03:51:07.979 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire in your
 
03:51:11.330 --> 03:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
service area been contacted to see what
 
03:51:13.130 --> 03:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
steps that they may want to plan for
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
should something happen like that
 
03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thanks for the question
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative so uh to answer the first
 
03:51:20.399 --> 03:51:21.349 align:start position:0%
representative so uh to answer the first
one

03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
um given
 
03:51:25.370 --> 03:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh the continued and I would say
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
increasing warnings from ISO New England
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
going into this winter
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
um we have been preparing
 
03:51:33.720 --> 03:51:34.670 align:start position:0%
um we have been preparing
um

03:51:34.670 --> 03:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
and doing exercises both internally and
 
03:51:41.929 --> 03:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
in coordination with with the iso and
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
Regional Partners so that we understand
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
the flow of communication what would
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
need to be done in the event of of a um
 
03:51:55.610 --> 03:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
of a call for reduced or I should say
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
controlled outages so we have been
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
continuing to refine our process plan
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
and work with
 
03:52:03.889 --> 03:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
um Regional stakeholders including the
 
03:52:07.190 --> 03:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
ISO in terms of communication to our
 
03:52:10.370 --> 03:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think it was maybe one
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
or two months ago we hosted a webinar
 
03:52:15.410 --> 03:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
where we invited all of our all of our
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities to attend explaining the
 
03:52:18.239 --> 03:52:19.729 align:start position:0%
municipalities to attend explaining the
situation

03:52:19.729 --> 03:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and what might happen in the uh
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully unlikely event of a call for
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh reduced load so so we have
 
03:52:30.530 --> 03:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
um that's the second straight year we've
 
03:52:32.570 --> 03:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
done that briefing for municipalities
 
03:52:35.150 --> 03:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to do so and and
 
03:52:36.889 --> 03:52:36.899 align:start position:0%
work with them to answer their questions
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh as long as this remains a concern
 
03:52:43.370 --> 03:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:52:45.050 --> 03:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
03:52:47.809 --> 03:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I know uh last year I think I was
 
03:52:50.090 --> 03:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of the first ones to present
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
that presentation with the assistance of
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
eversource in front of my Town Council
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
and I got raked across the coals on why
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
we allowed this to happen have you
 
03:53:04.269 --> 03:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps put out some more education on
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
why we are in this situation to the
 
03:53:09.889 --> 03:53:09.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities and to the people so they
 
03:53:12.410 --> 03:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
fully understand just how how we got
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
there yes
 
03:53:16.370 --> 03:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
um the short answer to that question is
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh we do
 
03:53:22.130 --> 03:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
um try very very hard to educate our
 
03:53:25.969 --> 03:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
customers on the cost drivers that have
 
03:53:27.530 --> 03:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
led to
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
um the the increase in their electric
 
03:53:32.450 --> 03:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
bills that that hit back in August uh
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
which are you know largely Regional in
 
03:53:37.250 --> 03:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
nature and tied to you know Global
 
03:53:37.260 --> 03:53:38.809 align:start position:0%
nature and tied to you know Global
economics

03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
economics
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
um as you heard last week from the
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and uh I think the
 
03:53:46.010 --> 03:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate as well it is a
 
03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
challenge uh to to sort of cut through
 
03:53:52.010 --> 03:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
the noise and um uh have folks
 
03:53:54.889 --> 03:53:54.899 align:start position:0%
understand that at the end of the day
 
03:53:56.690 --> 03:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
um you know it's our name on the bill
 
03:53:59.929 --> 03:53:59.939 align:start position:0%
that gets and so to try to explain as I
 
03:54:01.849 --> 03:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
did earlier that this is a pass through
 
03:54:04.670 --> 03:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is you know Regional natural gas
 
03:54:07.610 --> 03:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
prices that are affected by global uh
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
commodity prices it's it's difficult to
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
um to make that case but we do try very
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
hard using all of our communication
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
follow up sorry I'm sorry I I must have
 
03:54:29.090 --> 03:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
miscommunicated my my question was about
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
03:54:33.849 --> 03:54:33.859 align:start position:0%
the iso New England's notice about
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
potentials due to lack of capacity in
 
03:54:39.650 --> 03:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
the future that's what I was referring
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
to in terms of explaining to people of
 
03:54:44.590 --> 03:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
why we're in that position I
 
03:54:44.600 --> 03:54:46.309 align:start position:0%
why we're in that position I
understood

03:54:46.309 --> 03:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
understood
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
um most of our Communications on that
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
topic have been focused at the municipal
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
leader level as opposed to
 
03:54:58.849 --> 03:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
um at the customer level there is a lot
 
03:55:01.010 --> 03:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
of opportunity for
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
confusion uh we don't want to
 
03:55:03.319 --> 03:55:05.710 align:start position:0%
confusion uh we don't want to
unnecessarily

03:55:05.710 --> 03:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
03:55:09.050 --> 03:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
concern folks the iso has done a good
 
03:55:12.349 --> 03:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
job of putting out press releases and
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
there has been a number of news stories
 
03:55:17.570 --> 03:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
on you know their winter Outlook so we
 
03:55:20.450 --> 03:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
do work in coordination with them on
 
03:55:21.650 --> 03:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
that but
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's a balance uh for
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
sure about you know the detail that you
 
03:55:30.290 --> 03:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
the level of detail that you go out with
 
03:55:34.490 --> 03:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:38.450 --> 03:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
so the public the general public is
 
03:55:38.460 --> 03:55:39.650 align:start position:0%
so the public the general public is
hungry

03:55:39.650 --> 03:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
03:55:42.530 --> 03:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
for knowledge to help to help them
 
03:55:44.570 --> 03:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
understand why their electricity bill
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
has gone through the roof over the
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
course of the last eight months
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
is there anything that you can say
 
03:55:56.210 --> 03:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
relatively straightforward not too
 
03:56:02.689 --> 03:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
complicated manner about what ever
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
Source might do to prevent
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
another huge spike in electricity
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
prices now I know there's a procurement
 
03:56:15.290 --> 03:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
docket before the puc
 
03:56:18.290 --> 03:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
can ever Source say anything about the
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
possibilities for procurement that could
 
03:56:23.689 --> 03:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
prevent the kind of rate shocks we got
 
03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
this past August yeah
 
03:56:28.610 --> 03:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
03:56:28.620 --> 03:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
um

03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately what is driving
 
03:56:36.889 --> 03:56:36.899 align:start position:0%
the rates so significantly higher so
 
03:56:36.899 --> 03:56:37.910 align:start position:0%
the rates so significantly higher so
quickly

03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:56:41.170 --> 03:56:41.180 align:start position:0%
uh is essentially there is not enough
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
reliable Supply in the region to meet
 
03:56:48.170 --> 03:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
the demand uh during the winter time
 
03:56:50.929 --> 03:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of
 
03:56:50.939 --> 03:56:51.610 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of
um

03:56:51.610 --> 03:56:51.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:53.929 --> 03:56:53.939 align:start position:0%
power generation I shouldn't say the
 
03:56:55.250 --> 03:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
vast majority but the majority of power
 
03:56:58.130 --> 03:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
generation in New England uh comes from
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
natural gas and so natural gas-fired
 
03:57:03.729 --> 03:57:03.739 align:start position:0%
power plants and so in the winter time
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh when that natural gas is directed
 
03:57:08.450 --> 03:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
towards eating people's homes and
 
03:57:11.389 --> 03:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
businesses as the committee knows uh we
 
03:57:14.030 --> 03:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
have to rely on on other fuels to make
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
up that difference which tend to be less
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
efficient and more expensive but
 
03:57:21.410 --> 03:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical at this stage for
 
03:57:25.630 --> 03:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
the continued operation of the system so
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
if folks will recall back around uh New
 
03:57:32.330 --> 03:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
Year's Eve we were running for multiple
 
03:57:35.229 --> 03:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
days of over 40 percent
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
on on oil so there really are
 
03:57:44.590 --> 03:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
um supply and demand issues there and so
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
we want to be a constructive voice as
 
03:57:51.170 --> 03:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
this committee and the senate committee
 
03:57:53.450 --> 03:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
and the legislature and the governor
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
um continue consider options going
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
forward to bring additional Supply
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
diversify our supply while also
 
03:58:05.090 --> 03:58:05.100 align:start position:0%
providing incentives for our customers
 
03:58:07.130 --> 03:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
to reduce their usage through Energy
 
03:58:09.070 --> 03:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
Efficiency so
 
03:58:11.450 --> 03:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there aren't a lot of
 
03:58:14.210 --> 03:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
short-term answers in the short term we
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
are working very hard to communicate
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
with our customers about programs that
 
03:58:21.469 --> 03:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature has passed the federal
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
government has passed to help them pay
 
03:58:25.210 --> 03:58:25.220 align:start position:0%
for their
 
03:58:27.769 --> 03:58:27.779 align:start position:0%
utility bills or defer the cost of their
 
03:58:30.769 --> 03:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
utility bills but ultimately
 
03:58:30.779 --> 03:58:31.429 align:start position:0%
utility bills but ultimately
um

03:58:31.429 --> 03:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:34.130 --> 03:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
we are certainly supportive of policies
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
that bring additional Supply on and help
 
03:58:41.689 --> 03:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
to uh you know manage the demand uh so
 
03:58:44.809 --> 03:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
that we can uh you know successfully
 
03:58:47.689 --> 03:58:47.699 align:start position:0%
um navigate this you know Regional
 
03:58:51.410 --> 03:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
transition away from uh base load fossil
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
power plants to more intermittent uh
 
03:58:54.720 --> 03:58:57.170 align:start position:0%
power plants to more intermittent uh
Renewables

03:58:57.170 --> 03:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
Renewables
 
03:58:58.969 --> 03:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:59:01.070 --> 03:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
short answer is you don't see any
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
short-term procurement changes that
 
03:59:06.769 --> 03:59:06.779 align:start position:0%
could ameliorate the
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
violent ups and downs of energy costs
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are things that
 
03:59:16.490 --> 03:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
um can be done in the I'll say short to
 
03:59:19.250 --> 03:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
mid term around procurement and one that
 
03:59:22.189 --> 03:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
gets often talked about is a concept
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
known as laddering so as I mentioned
 
03:59:27.530 --> 03:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
previously every six months we put out
 
03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
our full customer load there is
 
03:59:31.800 --> 03:59:33.530 align:start position:0%
our full customer load there is
maximum

03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh Market exposure at very specific
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
points in time and you know even a few
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
weeks one way or the other could could
 
03:59:43.250 --> 03:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
make a difference in the price that we
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
get back from the market and ultimately
 
03:59:47.090 --> 03:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
charge our customers so one of the
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
things that other states have done is to
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
break up that load break up those
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
procurements say a third a third a third
 
03:59:59.210 --> 03:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
so if at any one point in time there is
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
Market uh shock going on for whatever
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
reason you're sort of only have a third
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
of your your load that's exposed to that
 
04:00:09.490 --> 04:00:09.500 align:start position:0%
and so it ends up being a blended rate
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
that helps with price stability But
 
04:00:16.130 --> 04:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
ultimately does not help with reducing
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity because you're
 
04:00:19.969 --> 04:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
still procuring from the same Market
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
that is is very volatile so that is a
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
concept that I know that is under
 
04:00:27.170 --> 04:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
consideration at the Public Utilities
 
04:00:28.189 --> 04:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
Commission as part of their
 
04:00:31.010 --> 04:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
investigation docket but something that
 
04:00:32.689 --> 04:00:32.699 align:start position:0%
could be done in the short term to try
 
04:00:35.570 --> 04:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
to stable lies prices and smooth out
 
04:00:37.750 --> 04:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
those those price shocks
 
04:00:40.370 --> 04:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
there is legislation in the Senate that
 
04:00:42.170 --> 04:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
was heard this morning to allow for
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreements
 
04:00:45.710 --> 04:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that would take time
 
04:00:48.110 --> 04:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
to to get that running up and running
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
but uh that could be
 
04:00:50.880 --> 04:00:51.729 align:start position:0%
but uh that could be
um

04:00:51.729 --> 04:00:51.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:55.790 --> 04:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts could provide a form
 
04:00:58.729 --> 04:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
of financial hedge against Market
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
volatility if you're locking up a rate
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
for a longer term of time that's a
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
portion of your supply that you might
 
04:01:09.170 --> 04:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
not have to go out for procurement so it
 
04:01:12.170 --> 04:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
can provide a hedge other Utilities in
 
04:01:13.969 --> 04:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
New England as well as in New Hampshire
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Electric Co-op is here have policies
 
04:01:19.370 --> 04:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
that allow them to do that as it stands
 
04:01:21.650 --> 04:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
today the utilities don't have those
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
those tools at their disposal as were
 
04:01:27.290 --> 04:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
regulated by the commission
 
04:01:29.210 --> 04:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sure committee members have
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
additional questions but I'm going to
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
ask them to hold those questions and
 
04:01:36.410 --> 04:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
maybe ask them of the other utilities so
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
that everybody gets a fair shot here to
 
04:01:41.689 --> 04:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh to represent themselves so thank you
 
04:01:44.090 --> 04:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
to eversource we appreciate that
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
and since you guys have been kind of
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
coordinating this joint utilities
 
04:01:50.210 --> 04:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
presentation I'll let you tell us who's
 
04:01:50.220 --> 04:01:51.349 align:start position:0%
presentation I'll let you tell us who's
next

04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh Unitil will be joining us uh briefing
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
you next uh and I'll let them come up
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
and introduce themselves great thank you
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.920 --> 04:02:12.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:02:12.250 --> 04:02:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:14.570 --> 04:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone thank you Mr
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record my name is Kat
 
04:02:18.050 --> 04:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
Burke I'm the director of government
 
04:02:20.210 --> 04:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
Affairs at Unitil uh with me today I
 
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
have Cindy Carroll she's our vice
 
04:02:24.410 --> 04:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
president of customer Energy Solutions
 
04:02:27.110 --> 04:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
as Mike mentioned earlier uh this is a
 
04:02:29.150 --> 04:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
joint presentation but we did divide up
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of the sections that have
 
04:02:33.650 --> 04:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
significant overlap for the utilities so
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be giving you a brief overview of
 
04:02:37.490 --> 04:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
Unitil as a company today and then I'll
 
04:02:39.469 --> 04:02:39.479 align:start position:0%
be passing it over to Cindy who will be
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
discussing New Hampshire's Energy
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
I just want to confirm you all have a
 
04:02:47.809 --> 04:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
copy of the presentation in front of you
 
04:02:47.819 --> 04:02:49.010 align:start position:0%
copy of the presentation in front of you
correct

04:02:49.010 --> 04:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:02:50.689 --> 04:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
um so Unitil isn't a regulated electric
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
and Natural Gas Distribution Company we
 
04:02:56.809 --> 04:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
were founded as the company that you all
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
know today in 1984 and our slogan our
 
04:03:02.150 --> 04:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
motto is to provide energy for Life
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
safely and reliably delivering natural
 
04:03:07.250 --> 04:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
gas and electricity in New England some
 
04:03:09.530 --> 04:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
of you may know that Unitil also serves
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
in Maine and Massachusetts we serve
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
strictly natural gas in Maine in a small
 
04:03:16.490 --> 04:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
footprint of both electric and natural
 
04:03:18.650 --> 04:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
gas in Massachusetts but we are
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
primarily a New Hampshire company with
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
our headquarters in Hampton
 
04:03:24.729 --> 04:03:24.739 align:start position:0%
uh here in New Hampshire we have about
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
390 employees
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
on our electric side we have about 78
 
04:03:32.090 --> 04:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
100 New Hampshire Electric customers and
 
04:03:33.769 --> 04:03:33.779 align:start position:0%
those customers are based in 34
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
communities in the capital or Concord
 
04:03:37.610 --> 04:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
region as well as the Seacoast region
 
04:03:39.650 --> 04:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
with our centralized electric Dispatch
 
04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
Center in Exeter New Hampshire on the
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
natural gas side we have about 36 400
 
04:03:47.330 --> 04:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
natural gas customers and those
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
customers are located in 22 communities
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
over in the Seacoast region only and our
 
04:03:54.590 --> 04:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
centralized gas Dispatch Center is in
 
04:03:54.600 --> 04:03:55.729 align:start position:0%
centralized gas Dispatch Center is in
Portsmouth

04:03:55.729 --> 04:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the map that you see in front of
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
you and displayed up on the screen the
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
yellow communities are the electric
 
04:04:03.410 --> 04:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
community so you can see the Concord
 
04:04:06.290 --> 04:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
region the Pinker red communities or the
 
04:04:08.929 --> 04:04:08.939 align:start position:0%
gas communities and then the over the
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
the overlaid stripe communities are
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
communities in which we serve both
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas and Electric
 
04:04:18.530 --> 04:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
now I'll pass it over to Cindy for some
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
ee conversation
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon everyone uh as Kat
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
said I'm Cindy Carroll and I'm
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for the planning and
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of Energy Efficiency
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
programs at Unitil thank you for the
 
04:04:38.750 --> 04:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here I've been asked
 
04:04:41.150 --> 04:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
to give a brief overview of the Energy
 
04:04:43.370 --> 04:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs that are
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
administered by the utilities here in
 
04:04:48.650 --> 04:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I thought I'd start
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
with just a quick uh refresher about
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
what Energy Efficiency is so that's what
 
04:04:55.370 --> 04:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
this first slide is you may have heard
 
04:04:58.130 --> 04:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency described as a least
 
04:05:00.889 --> 04:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
cost resource or a first fuel the first
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
fuel we should use and those are really
 
04:05:04.849 --> 04:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
accurate ways to describe Energy
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
Efficiency but put it really simply
 
04:05:10.670 --> 04:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is using less energy
 
04:05:13.490 --> 04:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the same thing so we all
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
use energy every day we heat our homes
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
we cook our food we clean our clothes
 
04:05:20.110 --> 04:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
and we use it to light our ways
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
very simply Energy Efficiency is doing
 
04:05:24.769 --> 04:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
all of those things in a way that uses
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
less energy
 
04:05:28.370 --> 04:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
a more efficient furnace more insulation
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the walls an energy star Appliance or
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
an LED light bulb these are all
 
04:05:36.889 --> 04:05:36.899 align:start position:0%
efficiency measures well that will let
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
us do the things we want to do but use
 
04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:47.929 --> 04:05:47.939 align:start position:0%
but there is a cost to achieving those
 
04:05:49.630 --> 04:05:49.640 align:start position:0%
efficiencies so energy efficiency
 
04:05:52.610 --> 04:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
requires an investment but it is the
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
least cost resource
 
04:05:57.410 --> 04:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
so for example in 2021 the average cost
 
04:06:00.490 --> 04:06:00.500 align:start position:0%
of saving a kilowatt hour of electricity
 
04:06:03.290 --> 04:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
with the Unitil programs or the utility
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
programs the average cost was 4.6 cents
 
04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour
 
04:06:10.610 --> 04:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's well below the cost of generating
 
04:06:13.010 --> 04:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
and delivering that kilowatt hour to any
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
home or business in the state
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
the same is true for the natural gas
 
04:06:17.040 --> 04:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
the same is true for the natural gas
programs

04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:06:21.290 --> 04:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
the average cost of saving a therm of
 
04:06:24.170 --> 04:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
natural gas in 2021 through the programs
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
was just 39 cents per firm of natural
 
04:06:26.880 --> 04:06:28.309 align:start position:0%
was just 39 cents per firm of natural
gas

04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
gas
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
so the point here is that there is a
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
cost to Energy Efficiency and gaining
 
04:06:32.640 --> 04:06:33.710 align:start position:0%
cost to Energy Efficiency and gaining
efficiencies

04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
but it's a good investment it's a good
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
investment for the people who actually
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
install the measures and save energy
 
04:06:42.050 --> 04:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
directly through a reduction in their
 
04:06:44.090 --> 04:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
energy usage and ultimately their energy
 
04:06:44.100 --> 04:06:45.229 align:start position:0%
energy usage and ultimately their energy
bills

04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
but it's also a good investment because
 
04:06:50.150 --> 04:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
indirectly it benefits all customers
 
04:06:53.330 --> 04:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
when we reduce demand for energy we put
 
04:06:56.210 --> 04:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
downward pressure on Energy prices and
 
04:06:58.689 --> 04:06:58.699 align:start position:0%
in the long run we may be able to avoid
 
04:07:01.969 --> 04:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
having to invest in expanding energy
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to meet increasing
 
04:07:03.960 --> 04:07:09.590 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to meet increasing
demands

04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.490 --> 04:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
so about the programs since 2002 the New
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire utilities have partnered
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
together to design and deliver Statewide
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs to New
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire customers
 
04:07:25.610 --> 04:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
from 20 uh sorry from 2002 through 2021
 
04:07:28.490 --> 04:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
these programs have saved billions of
 
04:07:32.030 --> 04:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
kwh of kilowatt hours of electricity and
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
millions of therms of natural gas
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
they have saved New Hampshire customers
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
an estimated 3.9 billion dollars over
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.929 --> 04:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
and the programs are designed to serve
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
all customers across the state so all
 
04:07:49.010 --> 04:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
residential customers and all business
 
04:07:51.410 --> 04:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
customers big and small
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've branded the programs as New
 
04:07:55.849 --> 04:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves programs
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
the brand helps customers find the
 
04:08:00.170 --> 04:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
program Services they need quickly by
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
having a Statewide single point of entry
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
into the programs for customers
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
now some customers know that they need
 
04:08:10.130 --> 04:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
to call the utility or can call the
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
utility to get information about the
 
04:08:13.610 --> 04:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
programs and Energy Efficiency in
 
04:08:15.530 --> 04:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
general and they do that Unitil
 
04:08:17.090 --> 04:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
customers call us directly all the time
 
04:08:19.370 --> 04:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
and ask questions about the programs and
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's great that is a pathway into the
 
04:08:23.809 --> 04:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
programs but for those customers who
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that understanding a common
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
way for us to market the programs Market
 
04:08:31.250 --> 04:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency to customers and a
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
single point of entry for those
 
04:08:32.520 --> 04:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
single point of entry for those
customers

04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
really helps get more customers into the
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
programs by having this Statewide Brand
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves and behind that
 
04:08:43.610 --> 04:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
stand all of the utilities in
 
04:08:43.620 --> 04:08:48.830 align:start position:0%
stand all of the utilities in
Partnership

04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.809 --> 04:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned we have programs for all
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
customers and I'd like to give a little
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
more detail you know deep dive into what
 
04:08:55.250 --> 04:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
those are
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
so starting with the residential
 
04:08:58.729 --> 04:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
programs we have programs that offer
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
home energy assessments oh I'm on the
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
wrong slide so sorry
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
um that provide home energy assessments
 
04:09:11.330 --> 04:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
that uncover opportunities for saving
 
04:09:13.849 --> 04:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
energy in customers homes
 
04:09:15.530 --> 04:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
we have Appliance and weatherization
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
programs programs that promote efficient
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
boilers and furnaces and heat pumps and
 
04:09:24.410 --> 04:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
we offer no cost on Bill financing to
 
04:09:26.689 --> 04:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
help cover the cost of the customers
 
04:09:29.689 --> 04:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
portion of the job if that kind of uh
 
04:09:31.490 --> 04:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know help is required of that
 
04:09:33.769 --> 04:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
particular customer
 
04:09:36.290 --> 04:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
we also partner with local cap agencies
 
04:09:38.990 --> 04:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
these are Community Action agencies and
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
we provide services with in partnership
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
with the Caps to our income eligible
 
04:09:43.560 --> 04:09:44.689 align:start position:0%
with the Caps to our income eligible
customers

04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
now these services that we provide to
 
04:09:49.490 --> 04:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
this group of customers are TurnKey and
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
what we mean by that is once they enter
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
into the program we take care of all of
 
04:09:56.150 --> 04:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
the rest they don't have to really do
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
very much at all
 
04:10:00.170 --> 04:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
and the services are comprehensive to
 
04:10:02.330 --> 04:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
ensure that we get the biggest positive
 
04:10:05.330 --> 04:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
impact that we can for these very you
 
04:10:07.490 --> 04:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
know pretty vulnerable customers in this
 
04:10:09.769 --> 04:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
in this certain sector
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
and those Services include health and
 
04:10:13.490 --> 04:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
safety measures like improved
 
04:10:15.769 --> 04:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
ventilation and moisture control because
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
we know that those kinds of things can
 
04:10:22.969 --> 04:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.830 --> 04:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
I also mentioned that we have programs
 
04:10:27.050 --> 04:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
for our business customers both big and
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
small in addition we have programs
 
04:10:32.450 --> 04:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
tailored for cities and towns both big
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
and small
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
so one of the most important things for
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
many small businesses and small
 
04:10:40.490 --> 04:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
Municipal customers as well is the
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
assistance that we provide identifying
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
and completing efficiency projects
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
um as many as as many of you might know
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
running a small business can be really
 
04:10:53.210 --> 04:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
time intensive can take a lot of time
 
04:10:55.490 --> 04:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
for small business owners just to run
 
04:10:57.650 --> 04:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
their own business and they don't have
 
04:11:00.110 --> 04:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
the time or the expertise to evaluate
 
04:11:02.330 --> 04:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
Energy savings or to find the right
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
contractors or vendors to complete the
 
04:11:04.319 --> 04:11:05.990 align:start position:0%
contractors or vendors to complete the
work

04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:11:08.570 --> 04:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
the same can be said for small towns who
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
lack those resources to do those things
 
04:11:12.290 --> 04:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
so we make it easy we make it easy but
 
04:11:16.849 --> 04:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
providing again TurnKey services to
 
04:11:18.410 --> 04:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
small business and to Municipal
 
04:11:18.420 --> 04:11:20.030 align:start position:0%
small business and to Municipal
customers

04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:11:20.040 --> 04:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
customers
um

04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
that will provide assistance from
 
04:11:25.130 --> 04:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
assessment all the way to the
 
04:11:27.290 --> 04:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
installation of the measures and we're
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
using fully vetted and approved
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
contractors and vendors to ensure that
 
04:11:33.650 --> 04:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
the savings are real and that the work
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
is done in the highest quality or to the
 
04:11:38.450 --> 04:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
highest quality standards for these
 
04:11:38.460 --> 04:11:42.170 align:start position:0%
highest quality standards for these
customers

04:11:42.170 --> 04:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.570 --> 04:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
and finally we have programs for large
 
04:11:47.450 --> 04:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
business and Industrial customers so no
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
doubt these customers have more
 
04:11:50.809 --> 04:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
resources to vet Energy Efficiency
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
projects than smaller customers but they
 
04:11:55.729 --> 04:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
also have many competing interests
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
there's always a competition for Capital
 
04:12:00.410 --> 04:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
among these large businesses and what we
 
04:12:02.650 --> 04:12:02.660 align:start position:0%
do is we help local on-site management
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
sell Energy Efficiency projects to their
 
04:12:08.689 --> 04:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
often off-site Executives so that they
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
can improve their facilities here in New
 
04:12:10.560 --> 04:12:11.450 align:start position:0%
can improve their facilities here in New
Hampshire

04:12:11.450 --> 04:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
helping them make the case that Energy
 
04:12:15.170 --> 04:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects at their facilities
 
04:12:17.689 --> 04:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
will be worth the investment and will
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
improve the bottom line of those
 
04:12:19.560 --> 04:12:20.990 align:start position:0%
improve the bottom line of those
operations

04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:12:22.969 --> 04:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
we find that when a business invests in
 
04:12:25.010 --> 04:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and saves on energy
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
cost more often than not those dollars
 
04:12:30.969 --> 04:12:30.979 align:start position:0%
saved are reinvested in that facility
 
04:12:33.050 --> 04:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
reinvested by expanding the business
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
there maybe adding a production line or
 
04:12:39.290 --> 04:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
two or even adding additional employees
 
04:12:40.969 --> 04:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
can certainly make the business more
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
viable in the markets they compete in
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
that's what I have it's a very high
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
level quick overview and I'm very happy
 
04:12:52.610 --> 04:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate that
 
04:12:57.050 --> 04:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
presentation I have a couple of
 
04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
questions myself actually sure
 
04:13:03.710 --> 04:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
you stated at one point that Energy
 
04:13:03.720 --> 04:13:05.590 align:start position:0%
you stated at one point that Energy
Efficiency

04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
Investments put a downward pressure on
 
04:13:08.819 --> 04:13:12.050 align:start position:0%
Investments put a downward pressure on
prices

04:13:12.050 --> 04:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
can you give us an indication of
 
04:13:18.410 --> 04:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
how that happens and
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
how much downward pressure these
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
common economic theory that says when
 
04:13:34.189 --> 04:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
you you know supply and demand when you
 
04:13:37.490 --> 04:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
reduce demand for a product or increase
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
supply for that matter you will have an
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
effect on price usually a downward
 
04:13:44.929 --> 04:13:44.939 align:start position:0%
pressure on price so that's just common
 
04:13:48.889 --> 04:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
economic theory but there's also a study
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's done in New England every three
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
years it's called the avoidance cost
 
04:13:54.170 --> 04:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
study and I know some of you may have
 
04:13:56.650 --> 04:13:56.660 align:start position:0%
heard of it but that study specifically
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
studies something called dripe and our
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
industry is you probably know loves
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
acronyms we use them all the time
 
04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
everywhere but dripe is the re
 
04:14:08.939 --> 04:14:10.870 align:start position:0%
everywhere but dripe is the re
demand

04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
demand
 
04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
induced reduction price effect I think
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
I've got that right maybe not I'd have
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
to write it down to get it exactly right
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
but dripe is a function of what you're
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
exactly talking about we study how the
 
04:14:28.030 --> 04:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
demand in energy the demand for energy
 
04:14:31.969 --> 04:14:31.979 align:start position:0%
affects price and what that effect is I
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the number Quantified at the
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
top of my head but every three years the
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
New England utilities who operate Energy
 
04:14:42.769 --> 04:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs study that effect
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
and put a value to it
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we could get a presentation on this
 
04:14:50.450 --> 04:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
stripe Factor at some point from the
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
utilities I'm sure we could give you
 
04:14:56.570 --> 04:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
that presentation and also probably
 
04:14:58.969 --> 04:14:58.979 align:start position:0%
arrange to have the consultant who
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually conducts that study who could
 
04:15:02.809 --> 04:15:02.819 align:start position:0%
probably articulate how they do the
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
study much better than we could uh come
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
and present to if that's if that's
 
04:15:07.199 --> 04:15:08.630 align:start position:0%
and present to if that's if that's
possible

04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
sure that's great one other quick
 
04:15:13.250 --> 04:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
question for you how much money do the
 
04:15:14.929 --> 04:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
utilities make
 
04:15:19.010 --> 04:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
on these New Hampshire saves programs in
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
program incentives
 
04:15:24.530 --> 04:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
so there is a
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
performance incentive that the utilities
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to earn there's a
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
threshold level of achievement that we
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
have to achieve before we start earning
 
04:15:36.769 --> 04:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
the incentive the incentive is a
 
04:15:39.290 --> 04:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
percentage of the
 
04:15:39.300 --> 04:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
percentage of the
um

04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
the program spending so how much it is
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
depends upon how much we spend on the
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
programs in any given period it's
 
04:15:55.070 --> 04:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
typically a 12-month period and my
 
04:15:57.950 --> 04:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
rough recollection is it's around four
 
04:16:00.530 --> 04:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
percent of the program spending overall
 
04:16:00.540 --> 04:16:02.150 align:start position:0%
percent of the program spending overall
but

04:16:02.150 --> 04:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:16:05.150 --> 04:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
um to get exact numbers for you I would
 
04:16:07.969 --> 04:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
need to go back and and look that up and
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
get that number for you
 
04:16:11.450 --> 04:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee well
 
04:16:15.290 --> 04:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
I see just about everybody has their
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
hands up on that side
 
04:16:21.050 --> 04:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
well go this way representative Summers
 
04:16:22.729 --> 04:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question mine goes to we know
 
04:16:27.170 --> 04:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
we heard about as I mentioned before
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
earlier about Christmas Eve and the
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
almost the ruling blackouts that we are
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
at risk of due to lack of power
 
04:16:35.210 --> 04:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
generation I'm wondering uh and because
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
of that because it was due to weather
 
04:16:38.450 --> 04:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
and weather Alone
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
um has there been a study I know there's
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
been a push for dealerships in New
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to carry more or to offer more
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles has there been a study
 
04:16:49.610 --> 04:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
for the demand on the power grid to be
 
04:16:51.710 --> 04:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
able to charge this increased amount of
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
electrical vehicles
 
04:16:59.570 --> 04:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
so we have a regular uh planning cycle
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
for distribution planning for our
 
04:17:05.090 --> 04:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure planning so it wouldn't
 
04:17:05.100 --> 04:17:05.710 align:start position:0%
infrastructure planning so it wouldn't
um

04:17:05.710 --> 04:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:09.650 --> 04:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
involve generation capacity so we would
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
only be planning for the demand electric
 
04:17:15.530 --> 04:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
vehicles or other distributed energy
 
04:17:19.729 --> 04:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
resources might put on our system but we
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
have Incorporated
 
04:17:24.830 --> 04:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
um der or distributed energy resources
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
of which electric vehicles may be won
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
into our regular distribution planning
 
04:17:30.720 --> 04:17:31.790 align:start position:0%
into our regular distribution planning
modeling

04:17:31.790 --> 04:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
modeling
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
so we're projecting an adoption rate for
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and then planning how
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
much of that would happen on our system
 
04:17:43.610 --> 04:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
and then you know some of this is
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
locational right so it depends upon
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
where it happens first but um that very
 
04:17:51.410 --> 04:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
complex distribution system planning
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
does include accounting for electric
 
04:17:55.729 --> 04:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
vehicle adoption
 
04:17:59.290 --> 04:17:59.300 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan is next
 
04:18:01.849 --> 04:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and thank you for
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
your presentation I want to go back to
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
the costs and benefits of the New
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program and
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
um we've had calculations of a four to
 
04:18:13.090 --> 04:18:13.100 align:start position:0%
one benefit based on the investment to
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
economic benefits overall in the state
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to talk a little bit about
 
04:18:18.769 --> 04:18:18.779 align:start position:0%
the or ask you a little bit about the
 
04:18:21.650 --> 04:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
social benefits as measured in demand
 
04:18:23.650 --> 04:18:23.660 align:start position:0%
for these programs and
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
What proportion of these projects per
 
04:18:28.610 --> 04:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
year would you say are met through your
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
budget and what What proportion of the
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
projects fail to be accomplished because
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money in the pot so
 
04:18:36.170 --> 04:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit program specific so
 
04:18:42.590 --> 04:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
for some programs we have enough money
 
04:18:44.929 --> 04:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
in the budget in in any 12-month period
 
04:18:46.849 --> 04:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
to meet all of the demand for that
 
04:18:46.859 --> 04:18:48.530 align:start position:0%
to meet all of the demand for that
program

04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
um but then there are also other
 
04:18:52.610 --> 04:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
programs where uh demand for program
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
Services exceeds the budget in any given
 
04:18:57.410 --> 04:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
year so you know one of the important
 
04:18:59.870 --> 04:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
things about the programs is continuity
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
so people will make commitments to
 
04:19:05.929 --> 04:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
projects late in one year
 
04:19:09.170 --> 04:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
hoping that there will be projects or
 
04:19:11.450 --> 04:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
programs available the following year
 
04:19:14.450 --> 04:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
for them to participate in so that's why
 
04:19:16.670 --> 04:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
program continuity is important so that
 
04:19:18.110 --> 04:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
people have confidence that there will
 
04:19:20.150 --> 04:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
be a program next year they'll invest
 
04:19:21.889 --> 04:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
the time and effort they need to get a
 
04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
project together and hopefully that'll
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
get funded in the following year but the
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
short answer to your question is it is a
 
04:19:30.290 --> 04:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
little bit program specific but there
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
certainly are programs where uh and and
 
04:19:35.210 --> 04:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
year to year specific as well sometimes
 
04:19:36.530 --> 04:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
there's more demand in one year than
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
another but there are times when there's
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
more demand for program Services than we
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
can satisfy in any one period
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
representative barishni is next thank
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
you chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:19:50.689 --> 04:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
question uh building on representative
 
04:19:52.990 --> 04:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
Summers question about electric vehicles
 
04:19:55.090 --> 04:19:55.100 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
04:19:57.530 --> 04:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
how much can the utility do in terms of
 
04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
capacity and Supply uh to deal with it
 
04:20:03.410 --> 04:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
or what what do you do to compensate for
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
what you know is going to happen as a
 
04:20:10.610 --> 04:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
um if I understand the question you're
 
04:20:16.370 --> 04:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
asking how so we do this modeling and we
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
project load profiles and then what do
 
04:20:22.969 --> 04:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
we do in response yeah that's I am not
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
an engineer okay Engineers are are very
 
04:20:28.969 --> 04:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
good at knowing what they need to do in
 
04:20:30.410 --> 04:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
different parts of the system so again
 
04:20:32.809 --> 04:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
it's very locational it's not ubiquitous
 
04:20:35.090 --> 04:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
some parts of the system have are very
 
04:20:37.309 --> 04:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
robust have a lot of capacity and can
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
take on a lot of extra load other parts
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the system not so much so it's it's
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
really a system-wide planning effort and
 
04:20:47.689 --> 04:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
the the remedies that you're talking
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
about to be able to take on that
 
04:20:51.170 --> 04:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
additional capacity that we're
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
projecting are also very locational in
 
04:20:58.130 --> 04:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
nature so a remedy in one spot might be
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
a very different remedy in another
 
04:21:02.090 --> 04:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
let's hold the questions to one per
 
04:21:04.250 --> 04:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
person because we have another utility
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
that wants to present and we're going to
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
have abundant opportunities to talk
 
04:21:12.290 --> 04:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
about Energy Efficiency in the next
 
04:21:15.170 --> 04:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
couple of months representative munz is
 
04:21:17.570 --> 04:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
next thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:21:20.150 --> 04:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
for coming in I have a question that I
 
04:21:21.229 --> 04:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
was going to ask the folks from
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
eversource and you as well
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
what percentage of your customers have
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
Smart Meters installed
 
04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
we have an Ami system deployed across
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
our entire system so it's a system that
 
04:21:40.490 --> 04:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
we installed in
 
04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
15 2015
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
and its power line carrier so the signal
 
04:21:48.110 --> 04:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
is actually carried back to Hubs through
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
the power lines and then communicated
 
04:21:51.530 --> 04:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
from there but all of our customers in
 
04:21:53.809 --> 04:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on the electric electric
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
customers have Ami meters
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:22:00.050 --> 04:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to hold it to one
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
question per person so everybody can
 
04:22:03.050 --> 04:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
have a chance here could I ask
 
04:22:04.670 --> 04:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
eversource to just answer that question
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
too yeah offline okay thank you uh
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Corman had his hand up
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:22:13.490 --> 04:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm imagining a
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
scenario where one of my constituents
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
says I want to make my home more energy
 
04:22:22.729 --> 04:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
efficient I want to weatherize it I want
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
to put in a heat pump something like
 
04:22:28.370 --> 04:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
that does New Hampshire saves uh direct
 
04:22:31.070 --> 04:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
them to somebody who can actually do the
 
04:22:32.330 --> 04:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
work I mean are there qualified
 
04:22:34.849 --> 04:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
contractors through the program
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes there's a couple of Pathways in the
 
04:22:40.130 --> 04:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
program so if you already have a
 
04:22:41.630 --> 04:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
relationship with a contractor you
 
04:22:43.130 --> 04:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
already know somebody you trust and want
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
to do business with they can participate
 
04:22:46.849 --> 04:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
in the programs
 
04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
assuming that they meet a certain level
 
04:22:50.570 --> 04:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
of qualifications
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
um but we have TurnKey Services as well
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
so if you call us and you say just
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
interested in having my home assessed to
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
see if there are any energy you know
 
04:23:01.130 --> 04:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
savings opportunities we will send out
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
qualified contractor to do that
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
assessment you'll get a report that says
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
what all of your opportunities are and
 
04:23:09.410 --> 04:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
how much they might cost and what the
 
04:23:11.450 --> 04:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
incentives might be from the utility to
 
04:23:14.090 --> 04:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
actually take those steps and then if
 
04:23:16.010 --> 04:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
you want we can actually assign a
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
contractor to that project as well so we
 
04:23:22.510 --> 04:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
have onboard qualified vetted
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
contractors who are subject to Quality
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
Control measures uh and and the same
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
qualifications that your own contractor
 
04:23:32.769 --> 04:23:32.779 align:start position:0%
would be required to meet thank you
 
04:23:35.450 --> 04:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki thank you Mr
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you can you give us
 
04:23:41.570 --> 04:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
some typical payback times for energy
 
04:23:44.929 --> 04:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
efficient appliances or whatever I know
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
you know for instance refrigerator is
 
04:23:50.090 --> 04:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
running full time so that you know there
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
should be some projection of how long it
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
would take to pay off a more efficient
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
refrigerator and obviously we hear about
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
LED bulbs and it really depends on usage
 
04:24:02.150 --> 04:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.210 --> 04:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
I don't have those specific payback
 
04:24:09.050 --> 04:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
periods I would just offer that that
 
04:24:12.050 --> 04:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
varies very much depending upon the type
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
of equipment you mentioned a
 
04:24:14.809 --> 04:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
refrigerator there's a whole host of
 
04:24:16.969 --> 04:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
refrigerators that meet the energy star
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
standard and would qualify but each one
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
of those probably has a little bit of a
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
different usage profile depending upon
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
how many bells and whistles you want to
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
have on your refrigerator you know do
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
you have an ice maker or do you not
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things and then also how
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
do you use it you know do you use you
 
04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
know do you have a big family where you
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
know kids are opening the doors and it's
 
04:24:38.150 --> 04:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
open all the time or is it just you and
 
04:24:39.769 --> 04:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
you and the wife and you don't open it
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
that much so it really does vary I'm
 
04:24:44.809 --> 04:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
sure there are averages but I I don't
 
04:24:46.510 --> 04:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
have those numbers with me
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
um if you referred earlier to the um
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
the drip study I'm going to try that
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
acronym again demand reduction induced
 
04:25:04.990 --> 04:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
price effect thank you uh presumably the
 
04:25:07.010 --> 04:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
economists that the utilities
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
collectively hire to conduct The Ripe
 
04:25:12.650 --> 04:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
study every three years are very smart
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
and they specialize in the utility space
 
04:25:18.250 --> 04:25:18.260 align:start position:0%
if they have concluded that
 
04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
the average cost of saving a kilowatt
 
04:25:23.650 --> 04:25:23.660 align:start position:0%
hour is
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
4.6 cents even if they were wrong by 50
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the number was more like seven cents
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
isn't that still substantially less than
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
the price that we're all paying now for
 
04:25:39.710 --> 04:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
a kilowatt hour of supply
 
04:25:42.530 --> 04:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
yes it's fair to say
 
04:25:42.540 --> 04:25:46.670 align:start position:0%
yes it's fair to say
thanks

04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:49.130 --> 04:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
okay let's move on we have another
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
utility that would like to present um
 
04:25:54.110 --> 04:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to briefly hit on my
 
04:25:55.610 --> 04:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
contact information at the end of the
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
presentation I know that there's a lot
 
04:25:59.450 --> 04:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
of familiar faces here but some new
 
04:26:01.130 --> 04:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
faces as well
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
um poor representative muns has been
 
04:26:04.490 --> 04:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
getting inundated with emails from me
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
but many of you will know that you know
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
during storms like Mr locata stated you
 
04:26:10.490 --> 04:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
know I'll be sending those of you who
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
represent Unitil service territories
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
frequent emails you can reach out to me
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
about emergency events about pieces of
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
legislation constituent concerns
 
04:26:20.330 --> 04:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
anything like that but we just want to

we're here and I think I speak for all
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
of the utilities we're all here as a
 
04:26:27.649 --> 04:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
resource for all of you and whenever
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
04:26:35.389 --> 04:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
and next up I believe is Liberty
 
04:26:35.399 --> 04:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
and next up I believe is Liberty
Utilities

04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:52.490 --> 04:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
please turn on the microphone please
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you okay thanks
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
again uh chairman Vos and uh and the
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee for uh hosting this event
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to try not to repeat uh
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
everything that my colleagues have said
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh but I would like to commend uh both
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh unitel and eversource for their
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
presentations uh the undergee efficiency
 
04:27:16.729 --> 04:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
presentation and we are a partner in
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
that process so there is really nothing
 
04:27:21.290 --> 04:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
more for me to add and I would like to
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
just reflect that my friend and
 
04:27:26.330 --> 04:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
colleague Mr Foley did a very nice job
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of describing the electrical
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
system the system in Liberty is very
 
04:27:34.250 --> 04:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
very similar just a little bit smaller
 
04:27:35.689 --> 04:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about that in a few
 
04:27:35.699 --> 04:27:36.889 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about that in a few
minutes

04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:27:36.899 --> 04:27:38.450 align:start position:0%
minutes
um

04:27:38.450 --> 04:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
my intention this afternoon is just to
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
introduce Liberty uh to the committee
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
but also introduce myself as you've
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
probably gathered my accent is
 
04:27:49.250 --> 04:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
um a little bit south of Manchester
 
04:27:51.649 --> 04:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
about 30 miles south of Manchester in
 
04:27:55.969 --> 04:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
the UK I joined the gas company in 1979
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
as a an apprentice on the back of a gas
 
04:28:03.050 --> 04:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
truck at that point the uh the um the
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
gas business was government owned as was
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
the electric business and both the gas
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
business and the electric transmission
 
04:28:14.269 --> 04:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
business in the UK were privatized
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
during the Thatcher Reagan years the gas
 
04:28:20.929 --> 04:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
business became lattice the electric
 
04:28:22.910 --> 04:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
business became National Grid who you've
 
04:28:28.929 --> 04:28:28.939 align:start position:0%
probably heard of and in early 2001 2002
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
National Grid acquired lattice to form
 
04:28:33.889 --> 04:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
the company that you've probably heard
 
04:28:36.530 --> 04:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
of now and have been mentioned today I
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
worked for National Grid and and its
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
prior companies until
 
04:28:45.889 --> 04:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
2021 for about 42 years and then joined
 
04:28:48.469 --> 04:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
Liberty here in New Hampshire almost two
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
years ago I came to the US in 2003 I was
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
the head of operations for Wales in the
 
04:28:57.889 --> 04:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
southwest which was about a fifth of the
 
04:29:01.370 --> 04:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
UK came to the U.S for two years which
 
04:29:03.530 --> 04:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
turned into three which turned into
 
04:29:07.130 --> 04:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
seven which is now turned into 20. I
 
04:29:09.649 --> 04:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
became a very proud American on the 4th
 
04:29:12.649 --> 04:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
of July 2017 and I became a Granite
 
04:29:15.050 --> 04:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
State for about about two years ago so
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
if anybody asks about my accent I
 
04:29:18.769 --> 04:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
usually say I have an original New
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
England accent
 
04:29:22.729 --> 04:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
I didn't think there'd be questions this
 
04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
early but I'm happy to take them
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:29:29.090 --> 04:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um and your
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:35.330 --> 04:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay I guess that covered it continue
 
04:29:36.950 --> 04:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
04:29:39.050 --> 04:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:29:41.210 --> 04:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
so a little bit about Liberty
 
04:29:44.689 --> 04:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
um Liberty is a growing company and as
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
you can see from the slide here every
 
04:29:49.370 --> 04:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
one of those dots represents a part of
 
04:29:51.889 --> 04:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
the territory we're way up in the north
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
as you can see in the Northeast in in
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh but we have territory
 
04:30:01.149 --> 04:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
across the US also territory in Chile
 
04:30:04.610 --> 04:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
and also territory in Bermuda in fact
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
during a recent storm there were Crews
 
04:30:09.050 --> 04:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
from Salem New Hampshire actually went
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
over to Bermuda to support their
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
restoration so we are a growth company I
 
04:30:16.610 --> 04:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
think a lot of folks think of us as a
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
very local company that's because one of
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
the things we pride ourselves in is a
 
04:30:23.090 --> 04:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
very local footprint but as the American
 
04:30:25.729 --> 04:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
Gas Association describes as now we are
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
a mid-sized American combo that's the
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
the category that we fall into
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
um in terms of our regulated utility
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
groups of which Liberty New Hampshire
 
04:30:40.969 --> 04:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
apart we are 34 distribution utilities
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire we are the uh only
 
04:30:47.809 --> 04:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
utility in uh in in the Eastern region
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about the little the Eastern
 
04:30:51.710 --> 04:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
region in a few minutes which has both
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
electric and gas we're in 13 states one
 
04:30:58.010 --> 04:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
Canadian province that's in New
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
Brunswick part of the same cluster in
 
04:31:01.729 --> 04:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
myself and I've already mentioned the
 
04:31:04.490 --> 04:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
two International utilities about 6.8
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
billion in assets and just over a
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
million utility connections
 
04:31:14.649 --> 04:31:14.659 align:start position:0%
the east region which we are part of
 
04:31:17.809 --> 04:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
encompasses New Brunswick ourselves here
 
04:31:20.809 --> 04:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Massachusetts Upstate
 
04:31:22.729 --> 04:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
New York which is the Old Saint Lawrence
 
04:31:25.130 --> 04:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
Gas right on the Canadian border and of
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
course now also North American water on
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
Long Island and we also have some small
 
04:31:33.469 --> 04:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
territory in Georgia and our
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts territory is in Fall River
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
of all of the Eastern region businesses
 
04:31:43.429 --> 04:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the largest so where
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
the performance of New Hampshire goes so
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
does the performance of Eastern region
 
04:31:51.469 --> 04:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
so we're a big part of the puzzle for
 
04:31:54.110 --> 04:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
for Liberty and an important part of the
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
puzzle here in the in the Northeast
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
just getting a bit closer to home now
 
04:32:04.010 --> 04:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
this is our territory in total we have
 
04:32:07.370 --> 04:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
just short of 143 a thousand customers
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
97 000 of those are gas and 45
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
000 are electric uh we are one of the
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
smaller Electric utilities in New
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but as we as as we like to say
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
we enjoy a big seat at the table and we
 
04:32:25.130 --> 04:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
do pack a punch when we need to
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
um which is evidenced by the two storms
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
over the holidays we serve 45 towns a
 
04:32:34.849 --> 04:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
total of just over 9 000 square miles
 
04:32:37.490 --> 04:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
and matrixed employees what I mean by
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
matrixed employees is I you know I'm
 
04:32:42.290 --> 04:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
responsible for the bottom line and the
 
04:32:44.809 --> 04:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
performance of all of New Hampshire but
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
some of the um some of the employees
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
that support New Hampshire also support
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
other regions too so the direct number
 
04:32:55.610 --> 04:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
of operational employees dedicated
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
solely to New Hampshire is 176 6 and we
 
04:33:02.929 --> 04:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
are supported by the remainder of the
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
430 who again their output is I am
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for so so the single throat
 
04:33:12.289 --> 04:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
to choke for Liberty in New Hampshire is
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
is in fact me as you can see from the
 
04:33:14.879 --> 04:33:15.890 align:start position:0%
is in fact me as you can see from the
slide

04:33:15.890 --> 04:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:33:17.929 --> 04:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
um the blue the electric
 
04:33:17.939 --> 04:33:18.769 align:start position:0%
um the blue the electric
um

04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
our electric business is non-contiguous
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
you can see better on this slide Monroe
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Charlestown and Salem uh in the
 
04:33:30.051 --> 04:33:30.061 align:start position:0%
event of a storm when we're trying to be
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
efficient and we're trying to use our
 
04:33:34.609 --> 04:33:34.619 align:start position:0%
resources as best we can it's a bit of a
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
jaunt from Lebanon to Salem but we do
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
watch the weather very carefully and we
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
are able to Stage uh stage our employees
 
04:33:45.410 --> 04:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
in the best possible
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
um best possible areas however however
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
as you can see from there it's not not
 
04:33:53.330 --> 04:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
being contiguous some of that is is
 
04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
quite difficult
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
um 45 000 customers as I mentioned
 
04:34:01.010 --> 04:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
substations uh Mr Foley mentioned uh
 
04:34:04.970 --> 04:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
substations 14 feeders 39 and then
 
04:34:07.310 --> 04:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
operational employees who are Crews and
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
supervisors uh 56. a couple of uh
 
04:34:13.010 --> 04:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
highlights of our system Rockingham
 
04:34:16.429 --> 04:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
substation was a 10-year investment we
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
unveiled it last year it is uh to
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
respond to significant growth in the
 
04:34:24.529 --> 04:34:24.539 align:start position:0%
Salem area and
 
04:34:27.051 --> 04:34:27.061 align:start position:0%
um and and actually uh we've got a an
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
inquiry that we're working on now which
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
is enabled by that investment which
 
04:34:34.029 --> 04:34:34.039 align:start position:0%
could potentially bring an additional
 
04:34:38.209 --> 04:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
400 jobs to the area and then storm
 
04:34:41.090 --> 04:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
Elliott and Diaz in the over the last 10
 
04:34:43.609 --> 04:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
years as Mr Foley mentioned there are
 
04:34:46.490 --> 04:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
damages and those damages result in
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
multiple outages
 
04:34:51.890 --> 04:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
um over the last 10 years the maximum
 
04:34:54.529 --> 04:34:54.539 align:start position:0%
the maximum outage number for any given
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
storm was somewhere in the region of
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
64.65 storm Elliott and Diaz were 110
 
04:35:05.209 --> 04:35:05.219 align:start position:0%
and 107 respectively so they were
 
04:35:08.510 --> 04:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
significant events for us and one of the
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
things I would like to say is when we do
 
04:35:12.849 --> 04:35:12.859 align:start position:0%
get these events we do all work together
 
04:35:15.410 --> 04:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
across the utility aisle and I do want
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
to stress that myself and my colleagues
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
here not only do we participate in
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
mutual Aid
 
04:35:24.730 --> 04:35:24.740 align:start position:0%
um but but we're also communicating
 
04:35:27.650 --> 04:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
through the event to make sure that we
 
04:35:30.051 --> 04:35:30.061 align:start position:0%
are all serving all of New Hampshire
 
04:35:32.529 --> 04:35:32.539 align:start position:0%
customers together
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
04:35:37.609 --> 04:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:35:39.410 --> 04:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
um I'll ask you the same question I
 
04:35:43.010 --> 04:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
asked the folks from Unitil how many of
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
your customers or what percentage of
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
your customers have Smart Meters
 
04:35:48.529 --> 04:35:48.539 align:start position:0%
installed I I don't have the answers to
 
04:35:50.750 --> 04:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
that okay times but we can get it for
 
04:35:55.970 --> 04:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.980 --> 04:35:56.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:35:56.929 --> 04:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:35:59.689 --> 04:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
let me uh just get my uh get my place
 
04:36:03.650 --> 04:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
back so so so our electric business as
 
04:36:06.051 --> 04:36:06.061 align:start position:0%
as you can see here it's non-contiguous
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
it is spread out
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
um and and yeah I was mentioning how we
 
04:36:12.410 --> 04:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
work together a good example is through
 
04:36:14.929 --> 04:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
mutual Aid uh once we'd finished our
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
restoration we were able to send some of
 
04:36:21.051 --> 04:36:21.061 align:start position:0%
our contractor employees to uh to unitel
 
04:36:23.449 --> 04:36:23.459 align:start position:0%
to support them and then also send some
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
of our own employees up to up to the
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
co-op so we do all work together for the
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
betterment of all of New Hampshire
 
04:36:30.000 --> 04:36:32.449 align:start position:0%
betterment of all of New Hampshire
customers

04:36:32.449 --> 04:36:32.459 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a quick
 
04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
um it just seems um rather inefficient
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
to have these these spaces so far apart
 
04:36:44.570 --> 04:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
um how was that decided and is there any
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
way to make them contiguous at some
 
04:36:46.439 --> 04:36:47.269 align:start position:0%
way to make them contiguous at some
point

04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:36:48.410 --> 04:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
um the only way you can make them
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
contiguous is by acquisition
 
04:36:53.209 --> 04:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the energy Network
 
04:36:55.250 --> 04:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
across all of the Northeast there's lots
 
04:36:58.369 --> 04:36:58.379 align:start position:0%
of pockets of how these companies have
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
evolved over the years this was the
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
Granite State Electric business behind
 
04:37:03.949 --> 04:37:03.959 align:start position:0%
that would have been some other
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
iteration so this is an evolution so the
 
04:37:10.369 --> 04:37:10.379 align:start position:0%
way to fill in the gaps is either I
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
acquire some of my colleagues here or
 
04:37:14.510 --> 04:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
they acquire me
 
04:37:17.209 --> 04:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
thank you that's probably the most
 
04:37:18.890 --> 04:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
straightforward answer
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
if we think about the gas system so so
 
04:37:24.410 --> 04:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know I've been uh you know I I have
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
worked in the electric space for a while
 
04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
for National Grid I headed up there uh
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
construction business for a while I know
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Foley talked about trees and the
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
importance of trees in 2006
 
04:37:39.170 --> 04:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
um snow came early to the City of
 
04:37:41.689 --> 04:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
Buffalo a lot of Buffalo was backyard
 
04:37:43.730 --> 04:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
construction a lot of that backyard
 
04:37:46.010 --> 04:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
construction the customers out there had
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
kind of tried to hide the wires with a
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
lot of trees and everything else and in
 
04:37:53.090 --> 04:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
October 2006 those trees all came down
 
04:37:55.010 --> 04:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
and that entire backyard system was
 
04:37:58.010 --> 04:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
lying crackling in people's backyards so
 
04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
trees are the main issue but but yeah I
 
04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
was part of that business for a short
 
04:38:04.609 --> 04:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
period of time but most of my career
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
I've spent in the gas industry I'm a
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
member of the institution of gas
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
engineers and managers which is a world
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
of wagon organization
 
04:38:13.020 --> 04:38:13.970 align:start position:0%
of wagon organization
um

04:38:13.970 --> 04:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
outside the U.S which also gives me and
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
others their professional license to
 
04:38:21.529 --> 04:38:21.539 align:start position:0%
operate here in the US I'm a member of
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
the American Gas Association managing
 
04:38:25.131 --> 04:38:25.141 align:start position:0%
committee and also I'm the executive
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the best practices Steering
 
04:38:30.769 --> 04:38:30.779 align:start position:0%
group across all the industry when I
 
04:38:33.051 --> 04:38:33.061 align:start position:0%
think about expletives in a gas
 
04:38:36.289 --> 04:38:36.299 align:start position:0%
engineering an engineering office the
 
04:38:39.010 --> 04:38:39.020 align:start position:0%
biggest expletive is single feed
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
wherever possible you try and design a
 
04:38:44.449 --> 04:38:44.459 align:start position:0%
system so that there are multiple feeds
 
04:38:47.209 --> 04:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
into a system you don't want to rely on
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
one single pipe feeding a system what we
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
have here in New Hampshire is a single
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
feed feeding New Hampshire which starts
 
04:39:00.890 --> 04:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
in Texas and finishes in Concord that's
 
04:39:03.289 --> 04:39:03.299 align:start position:0%
the Kinder Morgan line we are
 
04:39:05.929 --> 04:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
susceptible to volatility in that line
 
04:39:09.051 --> 04:39:09.061 align:start position:0%
either price volatility through the
 
04:39:11.570 --> 04:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
folks that feed into that or Supply
 
04:39:14.810 --> 04:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
volatility by the very nature that we
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
are on the end of the system and like my
 
04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
colleagues have described both on the
 
04:39:22.010 --> 04:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
electric and the gas side price
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
volatility is subject to changes and
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
influences that happen outside our New
 
04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire borders and the question that
 
04:39:34.849 --> 04:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
you asked earlier was how can we
 
04:39:37.730 --> 04:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
insulate ourselves from both of those
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
both of the supply and price volatility
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to finish with that in a
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
few minutes but our system 97
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
000 customers it is the biggest gas
 
04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
Network here in New Hampshire
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
120 operational employees who on any
 
04:39:56.030 --> 04:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
given day you will see on the streets of
 
04:39:56.040 --> 04:39:57.590 align:start position:0%
given day you will see on the streets of
Concord

04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
04:39:57.600 --> 04:39:59.470 align:start position:0%
Concord
um

04:39:59.470 --> 04:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
1400 miles of Maine 70 000 Services
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
um Mr Foley mentioned uh substations the
 
04:40:09.610 --> 04:40:09.620 align:start position:0%
gas equivalent is a regulator station
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
the word for that in the UK is a
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
governor station and I will flip between
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
regulator and Governor because of uh
 
04:40:19.130 --> 04:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
because of just uh the way I was brought
 
04:40:21.650 --> 04:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
up uh critical valves these are valves
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we use to isolate the system in the
 
04:40:27.288 --> 04:40:27.298 align:start position:0%
event of an emergency we have 477 and
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
then cities and towns are 32. at the
 
04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
most um if you look across the nation
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
the biggest program of Works Across the
 
04:40:38.930 --> 04:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
Nation is what we would say is the leak
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
prone pipe process this is a process
 
04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
that eliminates a 10 inch and below a
 
04:40:48.650 --> 04:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
pipe which is susceptible to leakage and
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
they fall into two main categories the
 
04:40:53.810 --> 04:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
one is cast iron and the other one is
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
best deal best deal a steel that is not
 
04:40:59.690 --> 04:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
cathodically protected cathode is a
 
04:41:04.010 --> 04:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
basically a um a a a a it's it's an
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
element that draws all of the um
 
04:41:11.330 --> 04:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
all of the rust and the Badness from the
 
04:41:14.630 --> 04:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
pipe to the cathode so this is for cast
 
04:41:17.570 --> 04:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
iron and bear steel the best deal rusts
 
04:41:20.570 --> 04:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
and cast iron depending on how it was
 
04:41:20.580 --> 04:41:21.890 align:start position:0%
and cast iron depending on how it was
laid

04:41:21.890 --> 04:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
laid
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
um if you have a stress point on a cast
 
04:41:27.910 --> 04:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
iron Mane you then have a perfect
 
04:41:30.288 --> 04:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
circumferential crack and when you have
 
04:41:32.570 --> 04:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
a circumferential crack they leak
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
instantly and and and and there is a
 
04:41:38.570 --> 04:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
very very quick release of gas
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
fortunately cast iron systems are low
 
04:41:43.250 --> 04:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
pressure so you're not susceptible to
 
04:41:46.010 --> 04:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
large amounts of gas but they do leak
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
and in Winter
 
04:41:49.690 --> 04:41:49.700 align:start position:0%
um and and this year is extraordinary
 
04:41:53.690 --> 04:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
but during the the I just trying to
 
04:41:55.010 --> 04:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
think what it was called the Cyclone
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
that hit the Northeast a few years ago
 
04:41:59.570 --> 04:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue that I had when I was
 
04:42:01.970 --> 04:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
in a prior role in Boston was broken
 
04:42:06.170 --> 04:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
Mains through ground movement above that
 
04:42:08.690 --> 04:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
permafrost and instead of the leak going
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
up it went across and all those
 
04:42:13.490 --> 04:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
basements in the old buildings in in
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
Boston we finished that year without
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
incident but therein lies the risk so
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
that is why we spend a lot of our
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
efforts replacing these pipes not only
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
do broken Mains and leakage and and some
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
of those cast iron pipes as well leak
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
out of their joints but but joint
 
04:42:35.810 --> 04:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
leakage is only a small amount but also
 
04:42:39.170 --> 04:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
unburnt natural gas unburnt methane in
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
any form including Dairy is uh has an
 
04:42:44.810 --> 04:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
impact on the environment so a few years
 
04:42:47.090 --> 04:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
ago I would have said that my job was
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
the safe efficient and um
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
and compliant operations of our
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
distribution system I now add on to that
 
04:42:58.440 --> 04:42:59.830 align:start position:0%
distribution system I now add on to that
um

04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
environmentally responsible
 
04:43:06.770 --> 04:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
so so just looking at the system
 
04:43:06.780 --> 04:43:07.550 align:start position:0%
so so just looking at the system
um

04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:10.250 --> 04:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
one of the ways we do try and insulate
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
our customers from that price volatility
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
is by basically shopping around we have
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
a number of options we have pipeline gas
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
04:43:22.860 --> 04:43:24.350 align:start position:0%
we also have
um

04:43:24.350 --> 04:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:26.390 --> 04:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
um liquefied natural gas which we can
 
04:43:28.368 --> 04:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
truck around to our locations and we
 
04:43:31.250 --> 04:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
have storage capacity and then our final
 
04:43:34.490 --> 04:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
line of defense which we have in places
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
like Manchester is is propane air
 
04:43:38.160 --> 04:43:44.628 align:start position:0%
like Manchester is is propane air
um

04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
I guess uh we're going to interrupt you
 
04:43:48.288 --> 04:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
here for a question uh representative
 
04:43:50.810 --> 04:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
lewicki uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:43:53.530 --> 04:43:53.540 align:start position:0%
um I have a question you know the um
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
when Lawrence got burned down there was
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
no real local pop-off valve on that they
 
04:44:01.010 --> 04:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
had a control Loop that was thousands of
 
04:44:02.990 --> 04:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
miles long are we susceptible to that
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
same type of outage or do we have pop
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
you know simple pop-up health or
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
something similar to that in New
 
04:44:08.160 --> 04:44:09.110 align:start position:0%
something similar to that in New
Hampshire

04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
so uh so um I was um
 
04:44:15.530 --> 04:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
I was involved in that the restoration
 
04:44:17.690 --> 04:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
after that incident and I can confirm
 
04:44:21.050 --> 04:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
that the situation and the cause of that
 
04:44:22.730 --> 04:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
situation in Lawrence we are not
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
susceptible to that in New Hampshire
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
04:44:30.770 --> 04:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:44:33.650 --> 04:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question which is if not cast
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
iron or bare steel what are the good
 
04:44:40.850 --> 04:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
resilient pipeline components so so
 
04:44:43.490 --> 04:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
coated steel still is still a a firm
 
04:44:44.690 --> 04:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
favorite of the transmission system
 
04:44:48.890 --> 04:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
local system is is plastic pipe it is
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
um it is flexible when handled correctly
 
04:44:55.390 --> 04:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
it is strong it's robust in fact when
 
04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
fused together correctly the fusion is
 
04:45:00.770 --> 04:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
the point of fusion is the strongest
 
04:45:03.170 --> 04:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
point in the system when it's done
 
04:45:06.590 --> 04:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
incorrectly then it is a risk and uh and
 
04:45:08.110 --> 04:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
and there have been some incidents
 
04:45:10.970 --> 04:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
Harlem in New York was one such incident
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
where a fusion failed but when done
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
correctly it is the most uh there it is
 
04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
the it is the strongest part of the main
 
04:45:20.570 --> 04:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
in the same way as trees are to the
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
Electric System mechanical excavators
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
are to the gas system which is why we
 
04:45:27.170 --> 04:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
spend so much money on damage prevention
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
and educating anybody who who is is
 
04:45:31.970 --> 04:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
digging up the road anywhere near our
 
04:45:31.980 --> 04:45:36.110 align:start position:0%
digging up the road anywhere near our
infrastructure

04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:45:40.190 --> 04:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
um actually to piggyback up on that last
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
question uh in Merrimack recently we had
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
a significant gas leak because of a wall
 
04:45:50.410 --> 04:45:50.420 align:start position:0%
that collapsed at the outlet mall
 
04:45:52.730 --> 04:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
and I was going to make the comparison
 
04:45:55.010 --> 04:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
that rocks are to gas as trees are to
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
electricity we're the granite state do
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
you spend time and energy Shoring up
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
rocks so so most of our time is uh you
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
know there are areas where we will have
 
04:46:09.650 --> 04:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
to put pipe through rocks and and we pay
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
a premium at that they actually call it
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
ledge I I was out on that job at the
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Premier Outlets and uh what
 
04:46:19.610 --> 04:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
was interesting to me was how normally
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
the rocks that impact our system are the
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
ones that are underground that we have
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
to work through that they're not what is
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
a basically a human-made rock face uh
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
which which which interestingly enough
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
had signs and barriers on it saying
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
danger Falling Rocks
 
04:46:41.570 --> 04:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
um which then came down on top of our
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
main the good news was and I actually
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
have have pictures if you'd like to have
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
a look afterwards
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
um we have uh X we have a above ground
 
04:46:52.970 --> 04:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
meter installations and the rockfall
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
felt literally a foot short so the
 
04:46:58.990 --> 04:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
actual damage was to the underground
 
04:47:01.128 --> 04:47:01.138 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and not the above ground
 
04:47:04.490 --> 04:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
emphasis structure and and our crews
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
moved very very quickly to isolate the
 
04:47:09.410 --> 04:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
area and have now
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
kind of rerouted uh the the main in
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
order to be able to get the Premier
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
Outlets back on
 
04:47:19.550 --> 04:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh quick question
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
for you here I see from what you've said
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
here and posted it looks like that you
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
are not solely relate relied up on
 
04:47:31.730 --> 04:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
imported gas coming in from West Indies
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
and have you been asked is that true and
 
04:47:37.150 --> 04:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
have you been asked for uh energy
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
Generation by other energy suppliers to
 
04:47:42.410 --> 04:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
provide natural gas for the Generation
 
04:47:45.530 --> 04:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
Um we haven't no no and uh and yeah I
 
04:47:46.730 --> 04:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
would we
 
04:47:50.090 --> 04:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
the gas that we use we either we take
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
from the Kinder Morgan pipeline that
 
04:47:54.410 --> 04:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.410 --> 04:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay so if in the interest of time if I
 
04:47:59.690 --> 04:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
can draw your attention to Keen
 
04:48:01.730 --> 04:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh so so at the interview nobody
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
mentioned keen and uh and uh it's become
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
a bit a little bit of a little bit of a
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
joke around around Liberty because one
 
04:48:10.850 --> 04:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
of the things that is interesting about
 
04:48:14.050 --> 04:48:14.060 align:start position:0%
Keen is Keen is not fed on Pipeline gas
 
04:48:19.368 --> 04:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
Keane is the only remaining 24 7 propane
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
air system in the entire nation Catalina
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
Island off California
 
04:48:27.948 --> 04:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
um was was what was the other one that's
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
been closed down now so this is this is
 
04:48:30.600 --> 04:48:32.330 align:start position:0%
been closed down now so this is this is
unique

04:48:32.330 --> 04:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
unique
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that's unique about
 
04:48:35.448 --> 04:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
it is I actually think engineering
 
04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
students should go through this plant it
 
04:48:40.128 --> 04:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
is an Antiquated plant we've spent a few
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars over the last
 
04:48:43.550 --> 04:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
couple of years since I've been at
 
04:48:46.550 --> 04:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
Liberty and and there is a coincidence
 
04:48:46.560 --> 04:48:47.890 align:start position:0%
Liberty and and there is a coincidence
um

04:48:47.890 --> 04:48:47.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:50.930 --> 04:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
improving the switch gear and improving
 
04:48:53.570 --> 04:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
the technology which operates that plant
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
however however over the next few years
 
04:48:59.810 --> 04:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
we have a decision to make and when I
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
think about the decision that we have to
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
make what we're trying to do is think a
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
little bit differently think a little
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
bit differently as how we can serve we
 
04:49:10.850 --> 04:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
can serve Keen it's served right now
 
04:49:13.730 --> 04:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
with a combination of propane air the
 
04:49:16.368 --> 04:49:16.378 align:start position:0%
specific gravity of propane air is
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
different to national natural gas where
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
natural gas leaks it goes up when
 
04:49:23.570 --> 04:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
propane air leaks it settles into the
 
04:49:26.208 --> 04:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
ground and it permeates into the ground
 
04:49:29.930 --> 04:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
so as a gas engineer my preference is if
 
04:49:31.490 --> 04:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to have an emergency as
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
something that goes up instead of
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
something that goes down so we're
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
looking at some opportunities for Keen
 
04:49:40.128 --> 04:49:40.138 align:start position:0%
um mayor George out in Keene has
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
released a document which is a green
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
Keen document we've got some ideas that
 
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're working with
 
04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
um with mayor George and and also we've
 
04:49:51.530 --> 04:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
presented to the energy committee out
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
there and what we believe that we can do
 
04:49:56.270 --> 04:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
is transition
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
from a propane air mix potentially
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
to a hundred percent hydrogen within the
 
04:50:07.390 --> 04:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
next uh five to ten years hydrogen is an
 
04:50:11.570 --> 04:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
emerging fuel in the gas space it is an
 
04:50:15.170 --> 04:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
environmentally uh sustainable fuel
 
04:50:15.180 --> 04:50:15.948 align:start position:0%
environmentally uh sustainable fuel
um

04:50:15.948 --> 04:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:18.830 --> 04:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
it can be produced with uh with green
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
electricity produced from our own New
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire water and our own New
 
04:50:26.930 --> 04:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh sunshine and our own New
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire winds so it has some
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities there and across the world
 
04:50:36.350 --> 04:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
gas companies are looking to decarbonize
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
their networks by other sources than
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
simply handing their networks and their
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
customers over to an electric business
 
04:50:46.430 --> 04:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
because we're not there yet so so
 
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is a possibility there's uh
 
04:50:52.368 --> 04:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
there's a pilot in in the UK at the
 
04:50:56.330 --> 04:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
moment where 668 customers are being fed
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
a 20 hydrogen blend with no detrimental
 
04:51:02.330 --> 04:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
effect on what you would say was the
 
04:51:02.340 --> 04:51:03.350 align:start position:0%
effect on what you would say was the
normal

04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
normal
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
low pressure distribution infrastructure
 
04:51:08.570 --> 04:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
we're in a slightly different place in
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
the US at SoCal or taking a look at this
 
04:51:14.590 --> 04:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
as are others and it's now a regular
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
conversation point at the American Gas
 
04:51:20.208 --> 04:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
Association but I really just put that
 
04:51:22.970 --> 04:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
slide on because we may end up just
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
staying at renewable natural gas we may
 
04:51:27.470 --> 04:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
end up somewhere along that transition
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
but the opportunity is there by thinking
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
a little less traditionally and a little
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:34.368 align:start position:0%
a little less traditionally and a little
differently

04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
differently
 
04:51:37.250 --> 04:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
04:51:39.410 --> 04:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:51:42.050 --> 04:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
um that was the question that I was
 
04:51:43.490 --> 04:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
going to lead in on as I'm looking at
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
this step ladder that says 100 renewable
 
04:51:49.250 --> 04:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
natural gas can you explain what that
 
04:51:51.050 --> 04:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
means because I thought
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh 100 renewable would mean that it's
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
like zero emissions is that yeah so so
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
the the so RNG we can get RNG from a
 
04:52:02.448 --> 04:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
number of places the Rudolph the plant
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's um I know I've pronounced that
 
04:52:07.850 --> 04:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
wrong in in Bethlehem uh is uh is
 
04:52:10.430 --> 04:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
converting our own New Hampshire waste
 
04:52:13.250 --> 04:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
into a renewable natural gas which could
 
04:52:15.770 --> 04:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
be put into a pipeline system either by
 
04:52:17.570 --> 04:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
Trucking it in and feeding it in we're
 
04:52:20.090 --> 04:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh we've actually got an RNG
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
um a bid document out right now looking
 
04:52:24.288 --> 04:52:24.298 align:start position:0%
at some prices to see if that is
 
04:52:27.170 --> 04:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
feasible as an option to put into our
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
system and good for our customers uh so
 
04:52:31.368 --> 04:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's there's a whole host of
 
04:52:34.490 --> 04:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities so Dairy is another way
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
that we can create RNG and again put
 
04:52:38.930 --> 04:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
that into the system and burn it
 
04:52:41.690 --> 04:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
um so I understand RNG is what we're
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to call it but I guess what I want
 
04:52:47.448 --> 04:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
to understand is about the net effects
 
04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
in terms of emissions
 
04:52:52.970 --> 04:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
so so my understanding is that the net
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
effects are negligible when compared
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm an engineer I'm not an
 
04:53:04.490 --> 04:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
environmentalist but but my
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is is that this is this
 
04:53:09.470 --> 04:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
these are the options that we need to
 
04:53:11.868 --> 04:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
explore rather than just
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
um you know utilities particularly Gas
 
04:53:13.680 --> 04:53:15.288 align:start position:0%
um you know utilities particularly Gas
Utilities

04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
Utilities
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
um avoiding the question
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
so so so this is an opportunity I just
 
04:53:26.810 --> 04:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.090 --> 04:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas I guess has
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair
 
04:53:32.810 --> 04:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little concerned about
 
04:53:35.448 --> 04:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
um this transition which is in 10 years
 
04:53:38.090 --> 04:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
which is fairly aggressive the the
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
propane equipment can't handle natural
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
gas so they'd have to replace the
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
equipment to handle the natural gas the
 
04:53:46.368 --> 04:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
natural gas equipment can't handle the
 
04:53:48.110 --> 04:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
hydrogen so they'd have to replace that
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
it seems like this is a heavy hit for
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
the community to get to hydrogen so
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
there are 1250 customers out in Keene
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:53:58.730 --> 04:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
um can you repeat that there are 12
 
04:54:01.368 --> 04:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
around 1250 customers out in Keene right
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
now a blend of RNG or or hydrogen up to
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
20 would not require any changes in
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
appliances or or the burner tips in
 
04:54:14.570 --> 04:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
particular anything over that would
 
04:54:16.610 --> 04:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
require a visit and would require a
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
conversion but this industry did this in
 
04:54:22.690 --> 04:54:22.700 align:start position:0%
the 60s this industry converted from
 
04:54:26.090 --> 04:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
locally manufactured towns gas to
 
04:54:27.650 --> 04:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
natural gas around through the same
 
04:54:30.590 --> 04:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
process so so the model is already there
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
on how this industry can transform
 
04:54:37.128 --> 04:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.890 --> 04:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay so so thinking
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
just just thinking about the future
 
04:54:43.680 --> 04:54:44.390 align:start position:0%
just just thinking about the future
um

04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:46.670 --> 04:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
just down the road there's a there's a
 
04:54:49.490 --> 04:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
gas holder and that gas holder in in in
 
04:54:52.850 --> 04:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
the 1800s was was state of the art
 
04:54:55.970 --> 04:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
when I think about the gas industry and
 
04:54:55.980 --> 04:54:57.650 align:start position:0%
when I think about the gas industry and
the

04:54:57.650 --> 04:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
challenges facing the gas industry
 
04:55:02.810 --> 04:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
um We're Not Gonna We're Not Gonna face
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
those challenges by barreling our heads
 
04:55:07.550 --> 04:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
in in the sound neither are we going to
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
address those challenges by pulling
 
04:55:11.810 --> 04:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
together The Usual Suspects and with all
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
due respect when I and I think about the
 
04:55:16.510 --> 04:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
north The Usual Suspects around a table
 
04:55:20.330 --> 04:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
it's the you know the the regulatory
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
staff within the utilities plus the
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
lawyers plus the legislature
 
04:55:28.730 --> 04:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
I actually think in order to address the
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
issues we need to think a bit broader
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
than that
 
04:55:34.550 --> 04:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
that old gas holder down the road is is
 
04:55:37.250 --> 04:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
maybe our our Back to the Future
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity because when I look at that
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
gas holder what I see is locally
 
04:55:45.788 --> 04:55:45.798 align:start position:0%
um locally sourced locally produced
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
locally stored
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
um energy
 
04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
and and when I think about
 
04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
insulating New Hampshire from the
 
04:55:57.890 --> 04:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
volatility of what happens outside our
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
borders we have to consider a modicum of
 
04:56:05.868 --> 04:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
energy Independence in the mix and that
 
04:56:08.690 --> 04:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
gas holder reminds me of a time when
 
04:56:12.288 --> 04:56:12.298 align:start position:0%
there was such energy Independence we
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
have good New Hampshire wind we have
 
04:56:17.208 --> 04:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
good New Hampshire Sunshine we've had a
 
04:56:19.490 --> 04:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
little bit of that today we've got our
 
04:56:23.090 --> 04:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
own Dairy we've got our own dump a good
 
04:56:26.090 --> 04:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
example of which is in uh in Bethlehem
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have heat and mothers out front
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
working with utilities in Boston around
 
04:56:34.250 --> 04:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
geothermal we have rocks up here as it
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
was pointed out we have Woody biomass we
 
04:56:39.530 --> 04:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
have plenty of Woody biomass and we also
 
04:56:43.730 --> 04:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to um to create our
 
04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
own hydrogen but but here here is the
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
thing and this is one of the one of the
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
things that I would like to leave you
 
04:56:49.320 --> 04:56:51.410 align:start position:0%
things that I would like to leave you
with

04:56:51.410 --> 04:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:56:53.628 --> 04:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
we need to get the unusual suspects
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
around the table we need to get the
 
04:56:58.368 --> 04:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
scientists the innovators
 
04:57:00.890 --> 04:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
the business Community the college
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
principles the environmentalists we need
 
04:57:07.250 --> 04:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
to bring the community together across
 
04:57:10.128 --> 04:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
the utility aisle across the political
 
04:57:13.010 --> 04:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
aisle in order to
 
04:57:15.410 --> 04:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
pull our resources
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the energy future
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
looks like for New Hampshire
 
04:57:21.000 --> 04:57:22.430 align:start position:0%
looks like for New Hampshire
um

04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:24.288 --> 04:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
I'm looking forward to being a part of
 
04:57:26.448 --> 04:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
that that was one of the reasons I came
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
here for the opportunity to engage in
 
04:57:32.270 --> 04:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
those conversations but again just as a
 
04:57:34.010 --> 04:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
reminder the key challenge is right now
 
04:57:34.970 --> 04:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:57:36.650 --> 04:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of regulatory
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
uncertainty my colleagues mentioned
 
04:57:40.970 --> 04:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency there was a docket
 
04:57:43.368 --> 04:57:43.378 align:start position:0%
that came out a report that came out on
 
04:57:45.650 --> 04:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon of last week talking
 
04:57:48.410 --> 04:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
about Energy Efficiency which we had no
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
idea was coming I've mentioned Supply
 
04:57:53.208 --> 04:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
volatility and what we're trying to do
 
04:57:55.970 --> 04:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
to offset that I've mentioned price risk
 
04:57:58.550 --> 04:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
volatility and the other area which was
 
04:58:01.550 --> 04:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned today is an aging Workforce if
 
04:58:04.010 --> 04:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
you will notice I did actually spell
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
aging the UK way and not the US way
 
04:58:10.730 --> 04:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll leave with an apology
 
04:58:16.850 --> 04:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:19.010 --> 04:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
well seeing no questions I thank you
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
very much for being here excellent
 
04:58:20.638 --> 04:58:22.070 align:start position:0%
very much for being here excellent
presentation

04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
and all three of the utility the
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities did an excellent job
 
04:58:29.570 --> 04:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
nice overview from all of you we have
 
04:58:31.850 --> 04:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
one more utility to hear from
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that's uh the unregulated but
 
04:58:38.448 --> 04:58:38.458 align:start position:0%
extremely important New Hampshire
 
04:58:39.948 --> 04:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op
 
04:58:42.110 --> 04:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
they're especially important to me
 
04:58:43.730 --> 04:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
because I am a New Hampshire Electric
 
04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
Co-op member
 
04:58:49.730 --> 04:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we welcome the two of you to uh
 
04:58:52.010 --> 04:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
to our committee room and uh looking
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
forward to hear from hearing from you
 
04:58:55.970 --> 04:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos and honorable
 
04:58:57.530 --> 04:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:58:59.690 --> 04:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
Alyssa Clemson Roberts and I am the new
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
CEO at New Hampshire Electric
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative uh sitting to my right is
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
Michael Jennings our director of
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
engineering I have only been in New
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and at the co-op for four
 
04:59:09.708 --> 04:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
months so he's here to keep me out of
 
04:59:12.530 --> 04:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:14.270 --> 04:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
but at New Hampshire Electric
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is a little bit different
 
04:59:18.590 --> 04:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
um the people that we serve are member
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
owners so we don't just have customers
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
we have members and owners that help us
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
make our decisions they elect a board of
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
directors that governs what we do uh
 
04:59:29.208 --> 04:59:29.218 align:start position:0%
they help approve our budget set our
 
04:59:31.610 --> 04:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
rates and our strategic planning
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
we do operate at cost and over the last
 
04:59:36.770 --> 04:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
two years we've returned eight million
 
04:59:39.530 --> 04:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in margins to our members
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
we also have a subsidiary called New
 
04:59:44.150 --> 04:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire broadband and we are currently
 
04:59:46.128 --> 04:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
providing Broadband to about a thousand
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:50.878 --> 04:59:53.448 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:59:53.448 --> 04:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we were founded in 1939 I'm sure many
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
of you know that Rural Electric
 
05:00:00.530 --> 05:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
cooperatives began because no one wanted
 
05:00:02.930 --> 05:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
to serve the territory we serve
 
05:00:05.208 --> 05:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
I liken it to our Venture into Broadband
 
05:00:07.310 --> 05:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
today much of our members are left
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
without adequate reliable and high-speed
 
05:00:11.330 --> 05:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
internet service which is why the
 
05:00:13.490 --> 05:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
Cooperative once again said we would
 
05:00:16.190 --> 05:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
answer the call to serve we serve about
 
05:00:20.570 --> 05:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
86 000 homes and businesses in 118 New
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities we own and
 
05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
maintain about 6 000 miles of line and
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
we operate in nine of New Hampshire's 10
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
counties we have 250 employees that work
 
05:00:33.650 --> 05:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
in 10 different locations and about 40
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
percent of our membership is seasonal we
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
do think that is shifting a little bit
 
05:00:39.708 --> 05:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
uh post pandemic as people are finding
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.330 --> 05:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that really
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
makes us different is that we operate at
 
05:00:52.368 --> 05:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
a non-profit basis so again when we
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
return money to our members that member
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
stays in the state that money stays in
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
05:01:00.770 --> 05:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
and uh if you didn't know in 2000 our
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
members voted to Grant authority to our
 
05:01:05.090 --> 05:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
board of directors so we were no longer
 
05:01:07.730 --> 05:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
regulated in the state and we also have
 
05:01:10.010 --> 05:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
the lowest power supply rate amongst the
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
four utilities at 13.8 cents is where
 
05:01:15.050 --> 05:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
we're headed we still think it's too
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
high but we're headed in the right
 
05:01:16.320 --> 05:01:18.410 align:start position:0%
high but we're headed in the right
direction

05:01:18.410 --> 05:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:01:19.970 --> 05:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the things again that
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
make us special is that we're
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
accountable to our members and that's
 
05:01:24.650 --> 05:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
again why we founded our Broadband
 
05:01:26.810 --> 05:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
business so while I'm at the end of the
 
05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
day I will be short and sweet and answer
 
05:01:31.368 --> 05:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that was a short and sweet
 
05:01:33.120 --> 05:01:34.670 align:start position:0%
thank you that was a short and sweet
presentation

05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
but the question on everybody's mind is
 
05:01:40.610 --> 05:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
how did you achieve that lowest power
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
supply rate among all the four New
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire utilities discounting of
 
05:01:47.330 --> 05:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
course the other three utilities need
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
for profits
 
05:01:51.288 --> 05:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
uh what are you doing differently that
 
05:01:54.288 --> 05:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
allows the co-op to keep rates lower for
 
05:01:56.330 --> 05:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
every for all their members
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
so I will say there are a number of
 
05:01:59.330 --> 05:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
things that we do differently first of
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
all we're not regulated so that allows
 
05:02:04.730 --> 05:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
us to actively Monitor and procure our
 
05:02:07.550 --> 05:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
power supply in a different way we don't
 
05:02:09.410 --> 05:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
buy our power twice a year we purchase
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
our power when we find the market to be
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
advantageous to us so we may purchase
 
05:02:16.128 --> 05:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
every month we may purchase in a
 
05:02:18.590 --> 05:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
six-month block we may purchase you know
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
thirty percent sixty percent ninety
 
05:02:22.368 --> 05:02:22.378 align:start position:0%
percent all depending on what the
 
05:02:24.050 --> 05:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
markets are telling us is happening
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
right now and what is going to happen in
 
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
addition to that we have long-term
 
05:02:30.890 --> 05:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
mid-range as well as short-term
 
05:02:33.050 --> 05:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
contracts that we do currently I would
 
05:02:34.910 --> 05:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
say we're more
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
um in the short-term business of power
 
05:02:38.330 --> 05:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
procurement but if we see prices
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
continue to decrease we'll start looking
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
at options to hedge for the future
 
05:02:43.970 --> 05:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
the biggest difference is we're
 
05:02:45.530 --> 05:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
deregulated so we're allowed to do
 
05:02:47.330 --> 05:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
things a little bit differently
 
05:02:48.890 --> 05:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
we think it provides us with an
 
05:02:48.900 --> 05:02:50.330 align:start position:0%
we think it provides us with an
advantage

05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
05:02:52.330 --> 05:02:52.340 align:start position:0%
would you say a little bit more about
 
05:02:55.250 --> 05:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
the short-term versus long-term versus
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
midterm procurement that you do sure any
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
time that you buy power it it's a little
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
bit of a guessing game except for what
 
05:03:04.490 --> 05:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
you're doing right now
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
so when I go out to procure power I'm
 
05:03:08.330 --> 05:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
looking at the market and I say where do
 
05:03:10.070 --> 05:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's going and what's about to
 
05:03:12.590 --> 05:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
happen and so if we think that there are
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
indicators or if our experts are telling
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
us the price of power is going to
 
05:03:18.770 --> 05:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
increase over the next six months we'll
 
05:03:20.930 --> 05:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
start doing a six month or maybe even a
 
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
12-month procurement and we'll try to
 
05:03:25.010 --> 05:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
buy out to beat the price that's coming
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
if we think the prices are going to be
 
05:03:29.330 --> 05:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
lower what we'll do is we'll wait and
 
05:03:32.090 --> 05:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
we'll procure in 30-day increments or a
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
two-month increment to go ahead and
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
watch that price fall what we consider
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
to be long term would be over 10 years a
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
midterm would be anywhere from about
 
05:03:41.810 --> 05:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
three to ten and short term would be
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.570 --> 05:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
so what kind of factors do you take in
 
05:03:49.788 --> 05:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
con into consideration
 
05:03:51.970 --> 05:03:51.980 align:start position:0%
as you look at the market and try to
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
decide or predict where prices will go
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
sure so I can tell you right now we get
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
we have a number of experts that provide
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
us with forward pricing their best
 
05:04:04.730 --> 05:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
guesstimates is what I like to call them
 
05:04:07.128 --> 05:04:07.138 align:start position:0%
on what natural gas is going to do that
 
05:04:09.410 --> 05:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
market has been relatively volatile I
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
would say since the beginning of covid
 
05:04:13.368 --> 05:04:13.378 align:start position:0%
or the February storm after covet
 
05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
started and then you add in factors like
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on in Europe we know that
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's a war that is impacting the
 
05:04:21.650 --> 05:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
price of natural gas and I would also
 
05:04:23.930 --> 05:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
say that the continuing rise of using
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
natural gas as a heating element is
 
05:04:28.610 --> 05:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
putting a Competitive Edge on natural
 
05:04:30.650 --> 05:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
gas and who gets this product and who
 
05:04:32.810 --> 05:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't so natural gas is one of the
 
05:04:34.970 --> 05:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
huge indicators in New England and
 
05:04:37.250 --> 05:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
across many of the markets we've seen
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
markets and their construct be built
 
05:04:41.810 --> 05:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
towards more natural gas but there are a
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns that come with that you
 
05:04:45.948 --> 05:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
know hedging that way or or basing a
 
05:04:49.730 --> 05:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
market construct on a resource that we
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
know number one we don't have the
 
05:04:53.750 --> 05:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
pipelines to transfer and number two we
 
05:04:55.550 --> 05:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the storage capabilities to
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
hold which puts all of us at risk when
 
05:05:02.090 --> 05:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:04.970 --> 05:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
excellent representative Christian has a
 
05:05:04.980 --> 05:05:05.750 align:start position:0%
excellent representative Christian has a
question

05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
05:05:07.440 --> 05:05:08.750 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:05:10.910 --> 05:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
um so that question sort of leads me
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
into if
 
05:05:15.288 --> 05:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
um sorry what what would you say is like
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
the mix of
 
05:05:19.128 --> 05:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
um your energy sources compared to the
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
other utilities that operate in New
 
05:05:22.850 --> 05:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in terms of Reliance on
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
natural gas versus other
 
05:05:25.200 --> 05:05:26.208 align:start position:0%
natural gas versus other
sources

05:05:26.208 --> 05:05:26.218 align:start position:0%
sources
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
well I I would say in the New England
 
05:05:30.170 --> 05:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
area we're all relying upon the New
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
England ISO or at least we are primarily
 
05:05:34.730 --> 05:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
um if you look at other markets you know
 
05:05:37.970 --> 05:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
if you look at the ercot market they
 
05:05:40.250 --> 05:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Reliance on wind as well
 
05:05:42.288 --> 05:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
as natural gas if you look at the spp
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
market they have a fair amount of wind
 
05:05:45.948 --> 05:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
as well as coal if you look at miso
 
05:05:48.288 --> 05:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of coal as well the
 
05:05:50.570 --> 05:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
Rocky Mountain West which doesn't have a
 
05:05:52.850 --> 05:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
market has a lot of natural gas coal
 
05:05:54.890 --> 05:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
they're seeing an incredible amount of
 
05:05:56.510 --> 05:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
wind in that area and solar and the
 
05:05:58.730 --> 05:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
California ISO is Shifting towards a
 
05:06:01.970 --> 05:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
fully renewable base so it really is is
 
05:06:04.010 --> 05:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
regional dependent but we're all
 
05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
dependent on what the New England ISO is
 
05:06:05.878 --> 05:06:06.770 align:start position:0%
dependent on what the New England ISO is
doing

05:06:06.770 --> 05:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:06:10.010 --> 05:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know with the generation situation
 
05:06:12.530 --> 05:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you this is actually from one of
 
05:06:16.250 --> 05:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
your customers they asked me to ask this
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
question how do you calculate net me
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:26.930 --> 05:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
you use the microphone please thank you
 
05:06:29.930 --> 05:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit complicated because of
 
05:06:31.490 --> 05:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
um what type of net metering we offer a
 
05:06:33.530 --> 05:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
bunch of different rates for them we
 
05:06:35.390 --> 05:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
could follow up with us with the member
 
05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
individually if that would be easier
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
also if you could put that in writing
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
and a contrast
 
05:06:47.570 --> 05:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
um contrast that to how all of the puc
 
05:06:49.850 --> 05:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities calculate their net
 
05:06:52.610 --> 05:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
metering if you can get me that in a
 
05:06:54.590 --> 05:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
printout yeah absolutely I'd be happy to
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
follow up with that thank you and then I
 
05:06:59.570 --> 05:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.448 --> 05:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
um by now you probably know what my
 
05:07:09.530 --> 05:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
question is uh the answer is 100 thank
 
05:07:09.540 --> 05:07:13.190 align:start position:0%
question is uh the answer is 100 thank
you

05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
question was that it that wasn't sure
 
05:07:17.208 --> 05:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
the question was the percentage of
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
customers with with uh smart readers or
 
05:07:21.530 --> 05:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
so okay representative Summers has a
 
05:07:21.540 --> 05:07:22.310 align:start position:0%
so okay representative Summers has a
question

05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
just a quick question thank you Mr
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
chairman quick question for just for
 
05:07:25.920 --> 05:07:27.410 align:start position:0%
chairman quick question for just for
verification

05:07:27.410 --> 05:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
verification
 
05:07:30.050 --> 05:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
um due to your rates being about 50 of
 
05:07:33.288 --> 05:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
what the regulated uh providers are
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
um is that 50 difference from what I
 
05:07:36.890 --> 05:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
understand from what you said due to
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
regulation profit and then because you
 
05:07:41.090 --> 05:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
can go to the market more than twice a
 
05:07:41.100 --> 05:07:41.930 align:start position:0%
can go to the market more than twice a
year

05:07:41.930 --> 05:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
um the cost of average for hedging
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I would say yes with the caveat that
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not involved in how the
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
investor on utilities procure their
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
power so I would strongly recommend you
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with them about you
 
05:07:56.810 --> 05:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
know what they do with that I think one
 
05:07:58.730 --> 05:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
of the things the co-op does because
 
05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to is we assume some risk
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
with the market prices and and I don't
 
05:08:05.090 --> 05:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
think that's what's going on with your
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
investor owned utilities but I would
 
05:08:09.288 --> 05:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
just caution to say that you know we at
 
05:08:11.090 --> 05:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Electric Cooperative try
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
to balance a risk and a cost and so what
 
05:08:15.170 --> 05:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
we've been doing is is either purchasing
 
05:08:16.610 --> 05:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
smaller amounts when we see the market
 
05:08:18.770 --> 05:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
go down or larger or larger amounts when
 
05:08:20.270 --> 05:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
the market goes down in smaller amounts
 
05:08:23.230 --> 05:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.208 --> 05:08:26.218 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas has a
 
05:08:26.218 --> 05:08:27.170 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas has a
question

05:08:27.170 --> 05:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:08:28.448 --> 05:08:28.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:08:31.250 --> 05:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
well since this question has been asked
 
05:08:35.208 --> 05:08:35.218 align:start position:0%
so often uh my question is could you
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
define what is meant by a smart meter
 
05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
because I think there's some confusion
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
or could be confusion it's that term is
 
05:08:48.170 --> 05:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
used very Loosely yeah it is used very
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
Loosely I would say there's a couple
 
05:08:50.810 --> 05:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
different categories you could look into
 
05:08:53.090 --> 05:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
with Smart Meters one is just a
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
automated meter rating which is a system
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
that you would use to go around and
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
gather the data from meters more easily
 
05:09:02.330 --> 05:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
there's also an Ami system which is what
 
05:09:04.250 --> 05:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
we currently own it allows
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
bi-directional communication so we get
 
05:09:09.230 --> 05:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
data from our meters actively throughout
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
different periods throughout the day but
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
we can also send data out to the meters
 
05:09:15.070 --> 05:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
as well so it's a two-way communication
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
for example if a member called us and
 
05:09:19.610 --> 05:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
they wanted to change rate or they
 
05:09:20.628 --> 05:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to change something that's
 
05:09:22.250 --> 05:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
programmed within the meter we could do
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
that over the system as opposed to
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
having to visit their house there's a
 
05:09:28.368 --> 05:09:28.378 align:start position:0%
lot of value in the different data you
 
05:09:33.170 --> 05:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.180 --> 05:09:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:09:38.570 --> 05:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
um so uh are any of the smart meters
 
05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.400 --> 05:09:46.970 align:start position:0%
 
determining

05:09:46.970 --> 05:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
determining
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
what energy is being used at what time
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
of day for what Appliance
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
not down to the Appliance level you can
 
05:09:55.730 --> 05:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
see at the household level and then
 
05:09:57.350 --> 05:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's also a sub meter and Technology
 
05:09:59.530 --> 05:09:59.540 align:start position:0%
you could use for the appliance level
 
05:10:02.448 --> 05:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
certain appliances or load types have a
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
curve you could determine just by
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
looking at the data but at a high level
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
the meter will give you pretty much the
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
household usage as a whole thank you
 
05:10:13.850 --> 05:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
I have a follow-up metering question
 
05:10:17.570 --> 05:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
if I have an electric car at home and I
 
05:10:19.250 --> 05:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
want to keep track of exactly how much
 
05:10:22.610 --> 05:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
electricity I'm spending to charge my
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
electric car can I get a separate meter
 
05:10:28.128 --> 05:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
for my EV charging station yeah so a lot
 
05:10:29.868 --> 05:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
of utilities will offer a separate EV
 
05:10:31.970 --> 05:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
charging rate in addition to a lot of
 
05:10:33.410 --> 05:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
the car chargers themselves actually
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
track the usage on that similar to solar
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
or battery the inverters with those
 
05:10:42.350 --> 05:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
track the usage so a lot of times
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
utilities will deploy a sub meter but
 
05:10:45.530 --> 05:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
there's also other ways you could use
 
05:10:47.570 --> 05:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
meter and Technology within the existing
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
equipment to leverage that information
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Reynolds
 
05:10:54.890 --> 05:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
05:10:56.690 --> 05:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
um going back to your earlier comments
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
about the volatility of natural gas and
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
how it drives the price of electricity
 
05:11:07.610 --> 05:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
and the vulnerability and all that
 
05:11:10.490 --> 05:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
um what to what extent is the co-op
 
05:11:13.850 --> 05:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
looking to the price certainty of
 
05:11:16.910 --> 05:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
renewable resources
 
05:11:16.920 --> 05:11:17.810 align:start position:0%
renewable resources
um

05:11:17.810 --> 05:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:20.330 --> 05:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
to help balance that and before you
 
05:11:23.930 --> 05:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
answer I just want to mention
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite projects in a prior
 
05:11:29.868 --> 05:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
position was the one megawatt solar
 
05:11:31.910 --> 05:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
installation at the North Conway water
 
05:11:31.920 --> 05:11:32.990 align:start position:0%
installation at the North Conway water
Precinct

05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
Precinct
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
and they decided to procure that system
 
05:11:36.830 --> 05:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason they did that was
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
because the net metering rate was a very
 
05:11:42.010 --> 05:11:42.020 align:start position:0%
I would call it reasonable and fair
 
05:11:45.050 --> 05:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
value for any electricity they would put
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
back onto the system in the Mount
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.330 --> 05:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
so I would say that we are supportive of
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know small renewable projects in our
 
05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
area for sure I think as we enter into
 
05:11:59.930 --> 05:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
strategic planning in the summer
 
05:12:02.930 --> 05:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
probably early fall we'll be having some
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
of these very discussions and right now
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of working with the
 
05:12:09.770 --> 05:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
national renewable cooperative and
 
05:12:11.030 --> 05:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
talking to them about you know
 
05:12:12.410 --> 05:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
implementing some battery storage
 
05:12:14.750 --> 05:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
throughout our territory as well so I
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
would say anything and everything is on
 
05:12:18.650 --> 05:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
the table our goal is really to provide
 
05:12:20.570 --> 05:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know affordable reliable energy to
 
05:12:22.850 --> 05:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
our members and they overwhelmingly tell
 
05:12:26.170 --> 05:12:26.180 align:start position:0%
us that that is what their priority is
 
05:12:29.448 --> 05:12:29.458 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
05:12:33.288 --> 05:12:33.298 align:start position:0%
thank you this is from another customer
 
05:12:37.970 --> 05:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
um wants to know if um you if you or you
 
05:12:39.530 --> 05:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
and all the utilities if anybody gives
 
05:12:41.390 --> 05:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
to the education tax credit scholarship
 
05:12:41.400 --> 05:12:44.990 align:start position:0%
to the education tax credit scholarship
program

05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know the answer to
 
05:12:49.010 --> 05:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
that but I can follow up I know that New
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Cooperative does have
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
a number of scholarship programs that we
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
have ourselves that we run but I don't I
 
05:12:56.330 --> 05:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that and I'll
 
05:12:59.650 --> 05:12:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.910 --> 05:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I'm
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
intrigued by these smart meters and that
 
05:13:08.570 --> 05:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
you you say that 100 of your customers
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
have them do you credit them as one of
 
05:13:14.590 --> 05:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
the reasons for your prices being so low
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
no so I would say it gives us more data
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
to use from an engineering standpoint on
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
planning perspective it really helps us
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
prepare our system for the future so
 
05:13:26.090 --> 05:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
when we look at things like hey is our
 
05:13:27.170 --> 05:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
system going to be ready for electric
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles or what percentage of our
 
05:13:31.610 --> 05:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
membership is starting to adopt electric
 
05:13:34.208 --> 05:13:34.218 align:start position:0%
vehicles it helps provide data for that
 
05:13:37.850 --> 05:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
but it it doesn't give us too much extra
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
data to help us prepare for power
 
05:13:42.050 --> 05:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
procurement uh it just gives us more
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:51.530 --> 05:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question yep
 
05:13:54.110 --> 05:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up on where you left off and
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
just ask I know there's a lot of
 
05:13:57.230 --> 05:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
discussion now and a couple of bills in
 
05:13:59.208 --> 05:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
the Senate regarding transactive energy
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming that one of the
 
05:14:03.288 --> 05:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
benefits of having infrastructure that
 
05:14:03.298 --> 05:14:04.368 align:start position:0%
benefits of having infrastructure that
includes

05:14:04.368 --> 05:14:04.378 align:start position:0%
includes
 
05:14:08.690 --> 05:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
smart meters is that you can support uh
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Future Energy market in terms of
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
being able to support Peaks and such is
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
is that is that an accurate way of
 
05:14:18.288 --> 05:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
looking at it yeah correct it gives us a
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
lot more flexibility with what we can do
 
05:14:22.970 --> 05:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
at the end user point at the member
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
point because we have that additional
 
05:14:27.050 --> 05:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
visibility and more real-time data it
 
05:14:29.708 --> 05:14:29.718 align:start position:0%
allows us to do more things as far as
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
transactive energy or time of use rates
 
05:14:35.690 --> 05:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
and how we Implement those yeah and I
 
05:14:36.890 --> 05:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
would just follow up that we are in the
 
05:14:38.448 --> 05:14:38.458 align:start position:0%
process of rolling out a transactive
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
energy rate and have been doing a pilot
 
05:14:43.490 --> 05:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
project with Plymouth State University
 
05:14:46.490 --> 05:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
on vehicle to grid projects so I would
 
05:14:47.570 --> 05:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
say that that's something that we're
 
05:14:49.610 --> 05:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
looking forward to rolling out for some
 
05:14:51.650 --> 05:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
further testing and further member use
 
05:14:54.288 --> 05:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
probably q1 or Q2 of this year may I
 
05:14:54.298 --> 05:14:55.368 align:start position:0%
probably q1 or Q2 of this year may I
follow

05:14:55.368 --> 05:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:14:56.930 --> 05:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:14:59.570 --> 05:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so transactive rate can you just tell
 
05:15:01.730 --> 05:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
us what you mean
 
05:15:04.250 --> 05:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
yeah essentially something that uh
 
05:15:06.410 --> 05:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
signals what the market is doing at the
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
time so essentially we have to buy the
 
05:15:11.150 --> 05:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
power from somewhere uh and so whether
 
05:15:12.770 --> 05:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's ISO New England or own membership
 
05:15:15.050 --> 05:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
we would prefer to to do it in a way
 
05:15:16.610 --> 05:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
that helps facilitate it for our members
 
05:15:18.530 --> 05:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
the best so the idea behind the
 
05:15:20.750 --> 05:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
transactive rate is that you know we
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
could provide two-way charging and get
 
05:15:25.730 --> 05:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
our supply from you know either the iso
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever PPA or membership is willing
 
05:15:30.050 --> 05:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
to provide the energy to us at the time
 
05:15:32.930 --> 05:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.050 --> 05:15:35.060 align:start position:0%
representative barasni has a question
 
05:15:37.010 --> 05:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you talk about
 
05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
the price difference between a smart
 
05:15:43.010 --> 05:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
meter and a regular meter and also how
 
05:15:45.770 --> 05:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
did you finance and roll out the how did
 
05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
you make the decision to uh
 
05:15:50.208 --> 05:15:50.218 align:start position:0%
yeah so I guess there's a pretty large
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
range there I mean there are smart
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
meters that have live high technology
 
05:15:54.830 --> 05:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
even built into them which we're not
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
procuring those those could be in the
 
05:15:58.128 --> 05:15:58.138 align:start position:0%
multiple hundreds of dollar range
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
whereas you know your traditional analog
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
meters are actually getting even
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to procure nowadays so there
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
is quite a wide range what I'd say that
 
05:16:08.570 --> 05:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
the typical meter for a utility is
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
probably in the hundred uh 150 range
 
05:16:13.490 --> 05:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
nowadays and as far as you know how we
 
05:16:15.170 --> 05:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
went about procuring them we actually
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
participated in a grant about uh 10
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
years or so ago Grant process which
 
05:16:21.948 --> 05:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
helped share some of the costs for our
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
membership and rolling out the smart
 
05:16:23.280 --> 05:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
membership and rolling out the smart
meters

05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.368 --> 05:16:31.378 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
05:16:32.930 --> 05:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to thank the two of
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
and uh like to thank all the utilities
 
05:16:39.770 --> 05:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
for being here and before I let you all
 
05:16:42.288 --> 05:16:42.298 align:start position:0%
go I just want to offer the committee
 
05:16:45.110 --> 05:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee one more chance to ask a
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
question of a member of any of the four
 
05:16:51.410 --> 05:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
utilities represented here today so
 
05:16:53.990 --> 05:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
Christopher representative munz gets the
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
first shot
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
so eversource guess what
 
05:17:02.690 --> 05:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh just like to know what the percentage
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
of smart meters that you have are so uh
 
05:17:09.770 --> 05:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
eversource uh we have AMR meters which
 
05:17:13.368 --> 05:17:13.378 align:start position:0%
are not quite as smart as Ami meters but
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
we were able to eliminate
 
05:17:17.930 --> 05:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
um you know having the the meter readers
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
go door to door to read those so we can
 
05:17:22.490 --> 05:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
can do the drive-bys and collect the
 
05:17:26.510 --> 05:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
information that way so uh Ami just use
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
the you know broader terms is usually
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
more described as a smart meter as Mr
 
05:17:35.208 --> 05:17:35.218 align:start position:0%
Jennings described AMR would not be
 
05:17:37.910 --> 05:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
described as a smart meter
 
05:17:41.208 --> 05:17:41.218 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up any idea on the
 
05:17:44.570 --> 05:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
percentages so you have is zero okay am
 
05:17:47.868 --> 05:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
I yep okay correct thank you
 
05:17:50.330 --> 05:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative has a question for
 
05:17:52.430 --> 05:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
someone uh thank you chairman my
 
05:17:54.770 --> 05:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
question is uh for Unitil
 
05:17:58.010 --> 05:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
um about the on Bill financing is Unitil
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
the only
 
05:18:01.550 --> 05:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
um utility that offers on Bill financing
 
05:18:02.930 --> 05:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
and can you talk a little bit about that
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
like what things can you finance and uh
 
05:18:07.490 --> 05:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
do you have to have your credit approved
 
05:18:09.530 --> 05:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
or what's the process
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
so each utility is a little different
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that all of the
 
05:18:16.368 --> 05:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
utilities are offering on Bill financing
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a credit check for
 
05:18:24.050 --> 05:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
customers but they do have to be in good
 
05:18:25.730 --> 05:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
standing in terms of their in terms of
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
their payment practices with us so
 
05:18:30.288 --> 05:18:30.298 align:start position:0%
that's the hurdle but I think some of
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
the other companies May impose a credit
 
05:18:36.170 --> 05:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
check before they do on Bill financing
 
05:18:39.410 --> 05:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
for their customers so it's a Statewide
 
05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
program but there are a little bit of
 
05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
differences from company to company but
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
generally it's the same on Bill no fees
 
05:18:48.850 --> 05:18:48.860 align:start position:0%
no interest and
 
05:18:52.430 --> 05:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
parameters for actually qualifying for
 
05:18:53.810 --> 05:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
the loan might be a little different
 
05:18:55.490 --> 05:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
between the companies but for you until
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
I can say we don't do its credit check
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
we simply require customers to be in you
 
05:19:06.050 --> 05:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.770 --> 05:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative brezny so what
 
05:19:11.570 --> 05:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of projects like if you install a
 
05:19:13.730 --> 05:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
bunch of solar panels at a house and
 
05:19:15.230 --> 05:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
then if the person moves and somebody
 
05:19:17.170 --> 05:19:17.180 align:start position:0%
else moves in do they pick do they now
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
is the the cost of those panels now
 
05:19:22.730 --> 05:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
included on the new owners bill or what
 
05:19:25.970 --> 05:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
what's the the process there so we don't
 
05:19:27.830 --> 05:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh actually
 
05:19:29.930 --> 05:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
solar panels are not part of the pro of
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
the programs right so it's Just Energy
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
Efficiency measures so probably a better
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
example would be if you add insulation
 
05:19:37.850 --> 05:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
to your home so we come out we do an
 
05:19:39.410 --> 05:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
assessment you don't there are
 
05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities to add insulation in your
 
05:19:42.650 --> 05:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
attic or your walls and that's going to
 
05:19:44.930 --> 05:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
cost a certain amount of money we would
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
give you an incentive to take that step
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
and do it but you would also have a
 
05:19:50.270 --> 05:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
co-payment for that project that
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
co-payment for that insulation could be
 
05:19:55.250 --> 05:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
financed on your bill over a period of
 
05:19:55.260 --> 05:19:58.010 align:start position:0%
financed on your bill over a period of
time

05:19:58.010 --> 05:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it I'm sorry the rest of your
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
question was does it follow the customer
 
05:20:06.288 --> 05:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
if you sell your home you would have to
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
your final electric bill when you leave
 
05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
that home would include the balance of
 
05:20:13.610 --> 05:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
that loan so it does not transfer to the
 
05:20:15.890 --> 05:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
next customer who owns that has that
 
05:20:18.170 --> 05:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
account or that meter
 
05:20:20.208 --> 05:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:20:22.010 --> 05:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
05:20:23.810 --> 05:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
um actually this is just a request if we
 
05:20:25.490 --> 05:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
could get the contact information for
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
the last two presenters sent to us thank
 
05:20:27.958 --> 05:20:30.830 align:start position:0%
the last two presenters sent to us thank
you

05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions of the utilities
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
this won't be your last chance because
 
05:20:38.510 --> 05:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
they'll all be back to testify on
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
various bills before us but if you have
 
05:20:43.330 --> 05:20:43.340 align:start position:0%
any other general questions
 
05:20:45.890 --> 05:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative bereshny I would just

05:22:40.138 --> 05:22:42.190 align:start position:0%
probably four and there is at the moment
a

05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:22:45.410 --> 05:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
executive sessions scheduled for that
 
05:22:45.420 --> 05:22:47.270 align:start position:0%
executive sessions scheduled for that
afternoon

05:22:47.270 --> 05:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
05:22:49.250 --> 05:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
the reason we're going to start having
 
05:22:51.948 --> 05:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
executive sessions that early is because
 
05:22:54.288 --> 05:22:54.298 align:start position:0%
there's two reasons one we have five
 
05:22:56.990 --> 05:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
early bills that have to be disposed of
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
by February 16th
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the second reason is we want to get
 
05:23:06.650 --> 05:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
builds into the hopper so that they can
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
get to the house floor in a timely
 
05:23:08.760 --> 05:23:09.770 align:start position:0%
get to the house floor in a timely
manner

05:23:09.770 --> 05:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
manner
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have what happened last
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
session happen this session
 
05:23:16.850 --> 05:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
those of you who were here last session
 
05:23:19.010 --> 05:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
will remember that several times we got
 
05:23:21.530 --> 05:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
to the house floor and we had so many
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
stne bills on the calendar that we ended
 
05:23:27.530 --> 05:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
up having to table several bills we
 
05:23:29.208 --> 05:23:29.218 align:start position:0%
couldn't have a floor debate on those
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
bills because we just ran out of time
 
05:23:35.690 --> 05:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
and the speaker requested uh that I
 
05:23:37.550 --> 05:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
table those bills I don't want to have
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
to go through that again I want floor
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
debates on all our bills
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the only way we can make sure that
 
05:23:45.530 --> 05:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
that happens is to get them to the floor
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
in a more timely manner so we're going
 
05:23:51.770 --> 05:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
to be executing executing bills
 
05:23:54.890 --> 05:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later and with with
 
05:23:56.930 --> 05:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
the idea being that we'll get them to
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
the floor so that we can have time to
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
debate them all
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative McGee yes thanks I'd
 
05:24:07.250 --> 05:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
just like to ask if we know which bills
 
05:24:08.690 --> 05:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hearing so we can get
 
05:24:10.010 --> 05:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
a jump on them
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
when will we have the list
 
05:24:14.270 --> 05:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
it'll be published in the calendar
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.288 --> 05:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
okay thanks I've had to make some
 
05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
changes to the list I have the list but
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
I have had to make some changes because
 
05:24:26.628 --> 05:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
I just found out this morning that one
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the bills that we got that I didn't
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
think was an early bill is in fact an
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
early bill so I've got to make some
 
05:24:32.400 --> 05:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
early bill so I've got to make some
changes

05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
