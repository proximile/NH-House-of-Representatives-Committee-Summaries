videos

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody
 
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
um here we are in the uh February the
 
00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
6th it's warmer outside so we can all be
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
favorable but you know unfortunately in
 
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
the other side of the world
 
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 align:start position:0%
um a horrific earthquake occurred
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday in Turkey in the Southeastern
 
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
portion of the country on the Syrian
 
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
border and I I've been in that area and
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
also all through the the uh west coast
 
00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 align:start position:0%
of turkey and
 
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
the area that got hurt hurt was the
 
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
Kurdish area and the area in Syria as
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
well and we're talking earthquake that's
 
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
approaching seven point what six nine
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that neighborhood that
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
those are real shakers I've been in
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
earthquakes up in Alaska a number of
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
times but they only got to the magnitude
 
00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 align:start position:0%
of 5 point plus and that's when the
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
dishes were flying off the the shelves
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
and the whole floor was rolling in our
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
house because we had radiant heat in a
 
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 align:start position:0%
cement slab and house was just like uh
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
like this and so I Penny the people over
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
there because the buildings which they
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
built have not been up to code
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
especially in that area of of the worlds
 
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
and they have well over a thousand that
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
they know are dead right now and well
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
over you know thousands which are
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
injured and and to top it off they're
 
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
going through some of that horrific cold
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
weather right now that we experienced so
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
our thoughts should be with them today
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
the issues which we're going to be
 
00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
dealing with are going to see minor
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
compared to what's going on over there
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
so going on
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to rec recognize those which
 
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
are the substitutes on committee day we
 
00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
have one person can't be here that or it
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
will be here in about 15 minutes traffic
 
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
jam evidently is awful where where's the
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
traffic jam located uh I'm not sure oh
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
she's coming from Bedford so I'm not
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
sure how exactly where okay so I'd like
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%

um I think Larry came on when I came on
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
years ago so
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%

well
 
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have listened huh
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
okay so going on with today's uh a
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
docket uh just a couple announcements uh
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
I've got a good return on the committee
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
reports and I really appreciate that got
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
everything in on the exact sessions for
 
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 align:start position:0%
2-1 February 1. I'm still looking for
 
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
some that came out on February the 3rd
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
however it's we're really getting the
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
job done here I need to have all those
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
that are for the third of February into
 
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
me uh by the closest close of uh I was
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
going to say close the school today but
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
by the close of our our dealing today
 
00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
by the close of our our dealing today
here

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.390 align:start position:0%
here
and

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
um then other announcements we we do
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
have some bills which uh we may jump
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
over today and that will guarantee us uh
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
early bills uh which we need a little
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
bit more discussion one is the funding
 
00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:22.139 align:start position:0%
issue dealing with how we fund education
 
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
um there are there are several policy
 
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be resolved I think
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
we're really getting working this out
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
but chances are we won't act on those
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
until the February 13th and I hate to
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
say if we absolutely need uh February
 
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
15th that's the of course in the 14th
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
you know we have the governor speaking
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
and we do have a session and then the
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
the 15th is the uh last day Wednesday
 
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
that we we can do it through on the 16th
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
but that won't to get early bills out so
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
we may need if we don't do it on the
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
13th there's also by the end of the day
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have some subcommittees
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
together on some of the the bills which
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
we've had 170 168 267 and 654.
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
those bills are ones which we have
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
recessed or indicated that we need
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work before we're going to
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
move forward they are not early bills so
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
we have to March 16th to work on that
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
so are there any other announcements
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee if not
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're just going to wait a little bit
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
until the traffic jam lightens up
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would just update
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
you on the situation over in the mid
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
East there they did experience another
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
almost magnitude 8.0 earthquake about 6
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's very serious and of course turkey
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
as you know has you know issues within
 
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
that country political issues and this
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas of the country which
 
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.430 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas of the country which
is

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
um having difficulty
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
so and the airports have been wiped out
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
in fact they the runways in Istanbul
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
which is that's a huge airport if you've
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
been there flown in there three times
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
and half the runways are out of
 
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
and half the runways are out of
commission

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
alrighty so let's just um we can get in
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
and open up our discussion and start
 
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
moving on some of the bills because we
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
do have a very heavy load today
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so I'm gonna jump over some bills and
 
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
jump down to something which we may be
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
able to you know
 
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
move forward on
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
relative to water bottle filling
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
stations in schools
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
the bill which uh
 
00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
um I I presented that bill earlier it's
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
one where we're trying to uh
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
okay this repeals the need for that
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority to adopt the rules
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this this the needs of this
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
statutory language already States just
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
like we did on the
 
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.410 align:start position:0%
like we did on the
um

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
issues associated with the fourth year
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
we embedded mathematics into the
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum at the at the high school so
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
statutory language expressed exactly how
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
it was done they did not need to make
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
rules they just took the statutory
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
language and made that the rule the same
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
thing right here with the water bottle
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
filling stations they want to make the
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
stat story language the rule so we don't
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
have to go through another six to
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
what eight months of rule making with
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
gel car and that takes a while so
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this before we
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
have a motion to move on that
 
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
if not I'm going to call on repson
 
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.370 align:start position:0%
if not I'm going to call on repson
McDonald

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
McDonald

um I believe that
um

00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill uh properly defines uh the
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
costs and who will be responsible for
 
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.110 align:start position:0%
costs and who will be responsible for
costs

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
um when there is uh a required placement
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
um it outlines that
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services is responsible
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
if the student placed is not special
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
needs or the placement is not due to a
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
special needs situation
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
doe is responsible if it is a special
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
needs student or if the placement is due
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
to special needs so I think that that's
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
needed Clarity in terms of the payment
 
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.350 align:start position:0%
needed Clarity in terms of the payment
responsibilities

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%

according to my notes that this was a
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
doe requested bill is that correct
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
the other others have that in their
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it actually says it on the
 
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.990 align:start position:0%
yeah it actually says it on the
um

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay did we ever get an updated fiscal
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
because you know Finance is going to
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
have to get that then uh if we're we got
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
to get it out of committee
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
um represent Tanner
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
I forget what a means uh in the in the
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
title The FN Dash a could you explain
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
that to me please
 
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
that to me please
probably

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
perhaps rep Heath does
 
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.230 align:start position:0%
perhaps rep Heath does
[Laughter]

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
maybe amended
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
521 fiscal note I thought it was
 
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
521 fiscal note I thought it was
appropriation

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think yeah this makes makes
 
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.529 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think yeah this makes makes
sense

00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:50.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
and where we don't know what the
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation is or needed that's going
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
to be fiscal's responsibility to get on
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
that that's most likely why this is
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
going as an early build
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
they need to get it to the second
 
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.370 align:start position:0%
they need to get it to the second
committee

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden I have a
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
question regarding this bill
 
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.130 align:start position:0%
question regarding this bill
um

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
is it only to pay the educational
 
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.690 align:start position:0%
is it only to pay the educational
component

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
of an episode of treatment
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.650 align:start position:0%
of an episode of treatment
um

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
or is it the full residential cost and
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
treatment and
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
medical and physical and mental
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
well I I think I'll answer that one on
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
page three where you'll see the
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
highlighted language it says any caught
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
on lines two three four five yep any
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
cost of special education or special
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
education related Services related to an
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment and determination
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
of placement by the Department of Health
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
and Human Services shall be covered in
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
full for students with disabilities by
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education I.E so
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're talking about education or
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
special education which is academics you
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
know we've gone through this with
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools okay
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
um where HHS was involved with that and
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
is involved that's where the money flows
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
through so by the wording of that I see
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
that yes doe will be responsible for
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
paying the education the academic stuff
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
in the IEP
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.789 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
um

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just wiped it out
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
so does this Trump VIP team
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
meeting or decision
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
or does it just reference the state will
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
pay for the educational component of any
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
student inclusive of special ed student
 
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:46.730 align:start position:0%
in that treatment facility
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.350 align:start position:0%
in that treatment facility
[Applause]

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
and is it educational
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
component or
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know my experiences that usually
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
the schools and the parents work in
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
Tandem and a parent who doesn't want to
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
know doesn't want anybody involved
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
usually takes care of it with their
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
insurance or however they do DHHS so I'm
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
just trying to get clarity on that
 
00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:11.390 align:start position:0%
just trying to get clarity on that
um

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
it says the doe is going to pay
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:21.230 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
uh it's not clear to me is it when a
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
student goes to an episode
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
and a parent places them say at
 
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.850 align:start position:0%
and a parent places them say at
Hampstead

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
Hampstead
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
the school is a technical question uh
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
Becky you're you've been a director of
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
picking on you
 
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
just going by experience sorry well I've
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
been there too and yeah IEP we've had
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
kids go up to the hospital for a
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
neurological correct you know and we
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
ended up carrying that Freight too but
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
that was years ago right thanks good
 
00:22:57.649 --> 00:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
morning for the record uh Becky Wilson
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire school boards
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
Association but previously served as a
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
special ed director here for about 20
 
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.090 align:start position:0%
special ed director here for about 20
years

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know representative if you want
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
to repeat the question I'll try to
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.049 align:start position:0%
answer the question
um

00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
so the amendment includes any cost of
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
special ed or related Services related
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
to an episode of treatment in the
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
determination of placement by the
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
shall be covered in full for students
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
with disabilities by the department of
 
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
with disabilities by the department of
Ed

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
Ed
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
is that in reference of students who are
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
not in public school
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
because it's my understanding that the
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
educational component
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
and special ed services usually a
 
00:23:42.659 --> 00:23:43.730 align:start position:0%
and special ed services usually a
district

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
tries to make sure that they either pay
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
for those to occur or provide them
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure who this is addressing
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned does this address the
 
00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:57.539 align:start position:0%
IEP team because I mean it's I can't
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
imagine that if a parent has to
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know bring a child to Hampstead
 
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.649 align:start position:0%
you know bring a child to Hampstead
Hospital

00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
and whether they're identified or not
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
that a school team immediately meets
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
and to get Services maybe that child is
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
immediately identified OHI
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
or already has a disability
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
so just trying to get some some detail
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
on what the intent is here and who does
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
it cover that is not already covered
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question does that
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
make sense I think so so I'll try to
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
give a brief synopsis of I think where
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to address
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
there there are students who for
 
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
whatever reason are placed outside of
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
the IEP team process to your point
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's challenges outside of
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
school the child needs immediate
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
placement somewhere or DHHS is involved
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
and they are the placing agency not the
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
school district those placements
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
occasionally and more often recently
 
00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
have been happening at a higher rate and
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
the IEP team is not part of those
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
decisions so the student might be in
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
school one day the next overnight
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
something happens the student is placed
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
either by the parent or by DHHS the
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
challenge is exactly what you're saying
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
which is that the IEP team has not is
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
not making that placement they're not
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
saying at school the child requires a
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
residential placement somewhere the
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
student is successful or at least able
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
to be addressed at school again they're
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
getting their faith at school but
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
because the child is placed Now by an
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
agency outside of the IEP team what has
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
been happening is that the school
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
district is on the hook so to speak for
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
the educational placement cost even
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
though they had no
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
part in making that decision and it
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter whether the team agrees
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
with or not I mean for the people are
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
making the decision that's right for the
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
student in that moment but it's not
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
really School related
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is just saying that above the
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
three times the amount the school
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
district is still paying for the
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
educational placement up to the three
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
times the per pupil cost it's only above
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
the three times just like the special ed
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
Aid that the Department of Education is
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
going to pay the difference because
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
what's been happening I believe to this
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
point and you would get a different
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
answer potentially or at least a more
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
concise answer from maybe somebody at
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
NHA sea is that the the district is
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
housing all the cost regardless of once
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
it hits sort of the cadied cap the
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
district has been on the hook regardless
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
because they don't have any control of
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
that placement but it's not necessarily
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
something that they've budgeted for so
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
this just says that
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
beyond the three times the per people
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
cost the department of Ed is going to
 
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
pay the difference regardless of how far
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
out that goes and it's I don't believe
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's at 80 I believe it's at a full 100
 
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.090 align:start position:0%
it's at 80 I believe it's at a full 100
percent

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to make sure that
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
follow sorry yeah so follow-up that yeah
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
the last part kind of got me a little
 
00:26:57.779 --> 00:26:58.490 align:start position:0%
the last part kind of got me a little
bit

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
when you said that once we get beyond
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
the three and a half
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
the the locals on the hook for 20 and 80
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
percent the state you were just saying
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
that the local would not be on the hook
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
for this that now with this language
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.630 align:start position:0%
right here
um

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it would be by the Department
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
of Education is that wiping out the
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the way that
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
I read this if you start on line 34 on
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
it says you know any cost beyond the
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
three times Etc shall be the liability
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Ed and then as you
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
go on to page three it says any cost of
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
the special ed or special ed and related
 
00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:43.970 align:start position:0%
the special ed or special ed and related
services

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:46.340 align:start position:0%
part of the episode of treatment
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
shall be covered in full for students
 
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
with disabilities by the Department of
 
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.909 align:start position:0%
with disabilities by the Department of
Education

00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:57.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you if you go just a little
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
further on page three line six through
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
eight it says the Department of Health
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is liable for all
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
court ordered and episode of treatment
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
costs other than special ed or special
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
ed and regulated services
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
so I read that to clarify what Dr Garden
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
represented was asking about
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
um and in the original discussion
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
I believe it was Rebecca Fredette who
 
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.789 align:start position:0%
I believe it was Rebecca Fredette who
said

00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
that the intent is to get these students
 
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
into the treatment they need avoiding
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
the lengthy process of court-ordered
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
placement which would be paid for but
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
is there a further discussion from the
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee represent Myler yeah my notes
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
indicate that all of this outside the
 
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.590 align:start position:0%
indicate that all of this outside the
idea

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
um that and it's beyond the IEP so it
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that this would be uh
 
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:01.220 align:start position:0%
clearly issues
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
around Behavior suicide potential
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
Etc that that's what this is really
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
really addressing not the inside
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
educational piece of it
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay does the is the committee at the
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
point where we're ready to act on this
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
bill no further discussion needed
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that representative thank you realize
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
the question that
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking back at uh Becky Curtis
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
dialogue so just so I'm clear on this
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
currently if a student is placed in a
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
non-ip placement emergency instead of
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
cancer hospital at Dr Scott brought up
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the school district is responsible
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
for only the Special Egg costs and DHHS
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
picks up the other costs associated with
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
the placement
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
and how is this going to change that I
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
didn't see the I hear what Becky said
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
about 100 I don't see that I do see what
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're talking about the 678 so I'm
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
really I'm just a little bit uh unclear
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
on the distribution or responsibility of
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
funding uh beyond the iee placement IEP
 
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.490 align:start position:0%
funding uh beyond the iee placement IEP
placement

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I wasn't here for that
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
hearing I was out okay in another area
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
so I I wasn't able to act you know
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
answer that is there anybody here that
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
could help out with that
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I quite understand the
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:30:48.899 --> 00:30:51.289 align:start position:0%
the question
um

00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm just trying to figure out how
 
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
this differs in terms of distribution of
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
funding uh with the bill change than it
 
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.529 align:start position:0%
funding uh with the bill change than it
does

00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:02.810 align:start position:0%
does
currently

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
spec is somebody out there yes
 
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
could you introduce yourself please for
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Rebecca Ross I'm
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
the director of children's Behavioral
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
Health at the Department of Health and
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
Human Services good help us I am happy
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
to help answer any questions although I
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
was not part of putting this bill
 
00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:37.010 align:start position:0%
was not part of putting this bill
together

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.669 align:start position:0%
together
um

00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
by the way brief history prior to a
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
couple years ago in order for a child to
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
access residential treatment and not
 
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital acute psychiatric
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
care but residential behavioral health
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
treatment they could only access that
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
through either the juvenile justice
 
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:55.460 align:start position:0%
system or the child protection system
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
which required a court order for
 
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.430 align:start position:0%
which required a court order for
placement

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
placement
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
previously this statute was amended
 
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.289 align:start position:0%
previously this statute was amended
um

00:32:05.289 --> 00:32:05.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
to provide for the payment of the
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
educational services for those children
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
who were court-ordered into placement
 
00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:15.299 align:start position:0%
through Child Protection or Juvenile
 
00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:16.430 align:start position:0%
through Child Protection or Juvenile
Justice

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
through part of the system of care and
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
the residential transformation we've
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
worked within the department to create
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
Pathways to access the behavioral health
 
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:28.700 align:start position:0%
treatment that children and youth need
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
without the trauma and need for court to
 
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
allow families to get the services that
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
they need earlier with shorter lengths
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
of stay to return home to the community
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
and to their schools faster without that
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
Court involvement so over the last
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
couple years we have started providing
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
that access to Residential Treatment
 
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
following a clinical assessment directly
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
through the behavior The Bureau for
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health these are
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
the cases that we're talking about the
 
00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:03.419 align:start position:0%
intent of this provision my
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
understanding was to match that of what
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
already existed for child protection and
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
JJ cases where
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the school would cover the cost of
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
the education for the child that needed
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
that placement and was unable to stay in
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
their their home
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
um while HHS picked up both the clinical
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
costs for the the mental health and
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services as well as
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
The Boarding care during that period of
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
time and this would just be matching
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
that otherwise we're going to be moving
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
in a backward Direction where children
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
and families are forced to go to court
 
00:33:41.649 --> 00:33:41.659 align:start position:0%
to access those Services
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
rather than getting them directly when
 
00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:45.350 align:start position:0%
rather than getting them directly when
needed

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:48.380 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any other questions
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you for being
 
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
here and clarifying this so what you're
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
really saying is that what this bill
 
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
does it really matches the practice
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's taking place currently correct
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
yeah yes and I think it provides some
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
clarity that when it's a voluntary
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
placement through the department so
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
we've vetted the clinical need for it we
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
have vetted that it's the appropriate
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
placement it's going through one of our
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
certified providers and we've approved
 
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.849 align:start position:0%
certified providers and we've approved
funding

00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
um then it matches what already happens
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
for those court involved cases this is
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
not if parents are choosing to remove
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
their children and go to an alternative
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
school or a boarding school this is for
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
those clinical Residential Treatment
 
00:34:30.419 --> 00:34:32.629 align:start position:0%
those clinical Residential Treatment
episodes

00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
episodes
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
um but that no longer require Court
 
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:39.050 align:start position:0%
um but that no longer require Court
approval

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
everybody got it represent cascaden
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
um just to be sure they would St talking
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
about non-special ed kids in a
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
residential treatment school district
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
will continue to provide the educational
 
00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
will continue to provide the educational
component

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
without going it through the systems of
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
care are fast I think that
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
can happen a lot of different ways I
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
think that's still something that we
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
need to work to problem solve through
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
um how how that's happening and and how
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
those decisions are made jointly
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
certainly the intent of the system of
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
care is that those decisions are made
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
through an entire team that supports
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
that decision but I think that there are
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
differences throughout the state how
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
that that's the confusing part for me
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
that uh for example there is a student
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I've given this example before that
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
resides in Plymouth New Hampshire
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
and has been placed in the correctional
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
facility in Haverhill New Hampshire
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
and was sent there via doing something
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
wrong in Hanover
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
and has now also receiving treatment
 
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
like this at Cottage Hospital in
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
Haverhill so the true student had that
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
person has an IEP
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that the
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
academic portion
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
that that student's going to receive
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
while at Cottage Hospital
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
for this episode of treatment is the
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
the resident District
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
so this is far beyond me once you start
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
to engage the correctional system
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
um they are no longer my clients I'm no
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
longer the Attorney General's office I I
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that because that's
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
lately we have somebody standing up in
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
even responsible for organizing how
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
those services are going to be delivered
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
to that studio under the hospital
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
setting hospitals offer all different
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
kinds of programming depending on what
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
hospital you are at and what the
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
purposes of your hospitalization the
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
district that's responsible for the IEP
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
will be responsible for figuring out
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
that perils exactly what I was saying
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's okay are there further questions
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk would you please call the
 
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.150 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk would you please call the

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%

spoke to that at the beginning of the
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
day we are not going to be dealing with
 
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
this today
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
um this is going to be taken up and put
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
on the on the calendar for uh a date to
 
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:23.540 align:start position:0%
be following here uh most likely on the

13th of uh
 
00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:30.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
437 relative to reading assessment and
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
Intervention Program this is also an
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
early Bill Rick yes
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
um since you just talked about 529 did
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah just in the same sort of package
 
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.030 align:start position:0%
yeah just in the same sort of package
idea

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
well 27272 is a bill it's not on the
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
agenda for today oh I thought it was
 
00:39:00.609 --> 00:39:00.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
there it is at the bottom yes so we're
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to hold off on that too right
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
and just to explain the 272 to it for
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh this this is a bill that
 
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.010 align:start position:0%
uh this this is a bill that
um

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.090 align:start position:0%
puts together
 
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.010 align:start position:0%
puts together
[Music]

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
the the different weighted uh notes you
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the Charter Public Schools
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
right yeah that's correct and this is
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
the per pupil cost of the Charter Public
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
Schools and uh whether this be part of
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's associated with what we're
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
discussing here with for 529 and there
 
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
is a relationship so we are going to be
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
putting that discussion together with uh
 
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.050 align:start position:0%
putting that discussion together with uh
529

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
529
 
00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh when we
 
00:39:55.859 --> 00:39:56.569 align:start position:0%
uh when we
um

00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
break here there will be some work on
 
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
that done
 
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.170 align:start position:0%
that done
um

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:02.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
administrative work on that uh to this
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
date has not been completed so both
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
bills would be not taken up today 529
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
and 272 if there are those there waiting
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
to hear those today we're not going to
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
be dealing with 272 either
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
so going on to 437 relative to a reading
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
assessment and Intervention Program
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh 437
 
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.390 align:start position:0%
uh 437
uh

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
look to represent codali for a motion uh
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would like to
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
move on to pass and I will uh offer an
 
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:46.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
437 it representative made that motion
 
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:56.540 align:start position:0%
so represent cordelli you're recognized
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr chairman
 
00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:01.069 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr chairman
um

00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
um literacy in uh New Hampshire
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:13.220 align:start position:0%
it does a number of things
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
it requires screening
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
um grades K through three
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
currently screening is done for dyslexia
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
this expands it to uh reading literacy
 
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:29.780 align:start position:0%
um it provides for Intervention
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
when there are deficiencies found in the
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
screening process
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.730 align:start position:0%
it goes
into

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:39.740 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
involvement uh both with parents getting
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
parents involved when there was a
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
deficiency I think it's required that
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
parents need to be involved and be given
 
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
the tools that they can use to help with
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
the situation with reading at home
 
00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.150 align:start position:0%
the situation with reading at home
um

00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
intervention will be based on the
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
science of reading and research over
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
decades as to how best to Children teach
 
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:14.780 align:start position:0%
children how to read
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
the community should be involved with
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
and a major shift also it does away with
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for third grade
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
reading deficiencies which now goes only
 
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
to students who do not qualify for one
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
of the other differentiated Aid
 
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
categories of special needs English
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
language learner or free introduced
 
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
luncheon so there's only about 2 200
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
students who qualify for the
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for third grade
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
reading and replaces it with a reading
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement grant that would be
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
available to
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
fund assistance in the district for all
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
those students who have a reading
 
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.710 align:start position:0%
those students who have a reading
deficiency

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
deficiency
 
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:09.260 align:start position:0%
um the original bill
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
has the median Improvement grade for
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
third grade the amendment expands it to
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
both second and third grades
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah right I will yeah
 
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
yeah right I will yeah
um

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh so I think those are some of the
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
major components of what we're trying to
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
do in this
 
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.630 align:start position:0%
do in this
um

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and um I don't know if the sector
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
wants to make any comments Mr chair but
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%

chair

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
the uh 377 Bill related to uh dyslexia
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
screening and that's on page four
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
starting line 16.
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay due to the fact I think some people
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
are seeing this for the first time would
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
you just take us uh walk us through the
 
00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
the amendment from A to Z
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
in other words first phase through
 
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.089 align:start position:0%
in other words first phase through
sure

00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:50.099 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:51.770 align:start position:0%
sure
um

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
on the first page of the amendment
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
um starting with uh section one starting
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
line seven
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
it basically uh provides for a universal
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
screener for
 
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
um reading and dyslexia
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
if we are going to be
 
00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.230 align:start position:0%
if we are going to be
having

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:20.099 align:start position:0%
funding these reading Improvement Grants
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
based on deficiency
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
believe that there has to be a common
 
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
product just like there is with the
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
state assessment that is used currently
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
for reading deficiencies
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh the department would be required to
 
00:46:40.809 --> 00:46:40.819 align:start position:0%
contract for such a screener
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
there is an appropriation for them
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
um and I I know in talking with the
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
Melissa white of the department they
 
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
Melissa white of the department they
have

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
already had conversations with uh
 
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.710 align:start position:0%
already had conversations with uh
several

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
going down further into the changes
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
there was a comment earlier about uh
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
um deficiency and we've made both
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
references to the efficiencies to be
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
substantial deficiency so it's
 
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:22.940 align:start position:0%
covered in both areas
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
we've included chartered public schools
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
in several locations you'll see in line
 
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
27 and 33 on page two so it's every
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
District School Board and chartered
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
Public School shall report annually
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
shall engage stakeholders
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
to discuss the importance of reading I
 
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.970 align:start position:0%
to discuss the importance of reading I
think

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
we want this not to be a school
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
classroom effort but a community effort
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
also to improve literacy in New
 
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.150 align:start position:0%
also to improve literacy in New
Hampshire

00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.319 --> 00:48:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.250 align:start position:0%
then
um

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
on page four where I mentioned the
 
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:21.740 align:start position:0%
edition of 377 the
 
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:24.020 align:start position:0%
dyslexia screening
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
is incorporated there and at the bottom
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
of page four is the appropriation for
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
the Department to acquire the universal
 
00:48:34.319 --> 00:48:36.130 align:start position:0%
the Department to acquire the universal
screener

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:36.140 align:start position:0%
screener
 
00:48:40.329 --> 00:48:40.339 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
Universal screeners I know the parent
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
company of uh Dibble has a product that
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
also incorporates
 
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.309 align:start position:0%
also incorporates
um

00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
recommended interventions when it
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
deficiency is is highlighted in the
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
screening and also has a parent portal
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
available because one of their sections
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
of these uh the bill also requires a
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
notification of parents as to what is
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
going on with the reading progress that
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
the child is is hopefully making so you
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
know there is the possibility for a
 
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
screener to Encompass a number of
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
functions that are called for in the
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative cordelli
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
maybe on on that on this represent miler
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh I noticed that on page four the line
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
18 you do uh make reference to Dibbles
 
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
and my concern
 
00:49:53.819 --> 00:49:55.870 align:start position:0%
and my concern
is

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
identifying a particular product
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
in a bill we've had problems with that
 
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
in the past so I I I'm I'm not I'm not
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
questioning the need for this kind of a
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
screening but I am concerned about
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
identifying a particular product in the
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill so uh why would we why would we do
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that's um that's thank you for the
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
question that's in current statute
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and it was also in House Bill 377 so
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
I just carry it forward and um meant to
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
um change that when I added the
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
department to acquire Universal
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
screening tool
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
um but it slipped by me
 
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.309 align:start position:0%
um but it slipped by me
foreign

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
to any great extent um in this
 
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.390 align:start position:0%
to any great extent um in this
um

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
in the sentence
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
um because it says Dibbles or an
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
equivalent and on page one it does call
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the uh
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh Department to acquire a universal
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
screener for both functions thank you
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
represent party all
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat similar in line eight
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
in reference to the science of reading
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
lower case
 
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.069 align:start position:0%
lower case
however

00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:17.750 align:start position:0%
however
um

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
I was trying to find out more
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
information about this uh as I was
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
looking over the spell the science of
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
reading and I and I Googled it and the
 
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
first result that came up was actually
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't identified as an ad so
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
someone might go there thinking it was
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
objective information about this
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
lowercase science of reading but it went
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
to a company's website amplify so my
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
concern is sort of some other I'm even
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
wondering if this phrase the science of
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
reading which reflects
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
needs to even be there I'm all for I'm
 
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
all for the the other items phone you
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
make awareness phonics reading fluency
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
all this stuff online's 10 and 11. my
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
concern is someone uh in a school local
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
school district might might similarly be
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
looking for information in Google
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
science of reading and be led to this
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
website which um had a certain agenda
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
which you know if it was very specific
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay yes go ahead
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh the science of reading
 
00:52:19.859 --> 00:52:21.109 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh the science of reading
is

00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
um a generic term that was
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
um coined to cover all the research as
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
you heard in testimony from Melissa
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
um as you've seen in the handouts that I
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
gave you I can quote you
 
00:52:40.619 --> 00:52:41.630 align:start position:0%
gave you I can quote you
um

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
um that the science of reading is a body
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
of research over decades it is not a
 
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.190 align:start position:0%
of research over decades it is not a
product

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
um if you uh I Googled the science of
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
reading also and got over 5.7 million
 
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.069 align:start position:0%
reading also and got over 5.7 million
hits

00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
hits
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
so to take a look at one article one
 
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.210 align:start position:0%
so to take a look at one article one
reference

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
reference
 
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.530 align:start position:0%
reference
um

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
um I I think is not uh valid for this it
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not a product no one recognizes it as
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
a product there might I don't know I
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at all the products
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
available someone might have named their
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
product the science of reading I don't
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
know but the science of reading in the
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
context of this bill and all other
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
legislation that is passed around the
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
country is that it is based on a body of
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
research and it in the bill talks about
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
the components of um what is to be
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
covered uh not just phonics but fluency
 
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
covered uh not just phonics but fluency
comprehension

00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
comprehension
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
Etc is all part of the science of
 
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.089 align:start position:0%
Etc is all part of the science of
reading

00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.099 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:53:50.099 --> 00:53:51.349 align:start position:0%
reading
um

00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:52.970 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
Arkansas for example passed legislation
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
two or three years ago to uh
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
they basically mandate
 
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.250 align:start position:0%
they basically mandate
curriculum

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
um and they passed legislation for the
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
science of reading to be required but
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
then went further and I think it's five
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
or six pages that I looked looked at
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
provided all the approved curriculum
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
related to science of reading and
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
Literacy for their schools to choose
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
from for K through 12. it goes on for
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
five or six pages by grade level so it
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
is not any one particular product it is
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
a body of research and
 
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.790 align:start position:0%
a body of research and
um

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
we talked about Dibbles they recognize
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
science of reading as a body of research
 
00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:47.099 align:start position:0%
and not any particular product as do I
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
think most all the screeners
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
that I have seen
 
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.309 align:start position:0%
that I have seen
um

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
for further discussion representative
 
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.650 align:start position:0%
for further discussion representative

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to also
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
take a closer look at the phrase science
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
of reading and just get into what I've
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to discover
 
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
um around this term because obviously in
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
having quotation marks around it it
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
signaled something to me that it may not
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
be generic so I looked into it there was
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
also when it was introduced a pamphlet
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
or paper from the company amplify
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and I noted the company amplify when
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
they were using the phrase science of
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
reading they capitalized the S and the r
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
which suggested something else to me as
 
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
well so I went down various rabbit holes
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
and indeed I don't disagree that science
 
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
of reading is not strictly a product
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
that that isn't what I I discovered
 
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.930 align:start position:0%
that that isn't what I I discovered
however

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
what it does appear to me is that there
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
was a coalition formed I believe I
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
actually had a name uh maybe the
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
defining movement coalition
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
um they they got together with uh his
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
various companies various organizations
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
such as amplify
 
00:56:05.819 --> 00:56:06.589 align:start position:0%
such as amplify
um

00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
and they formed something called the
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
reading league if I'm not mistaken
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
they went on to
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
um put out various products that are
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
utilizing what they call the science of
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
reading and this is not limited to any
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
particular company as far as I can tell
 
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of companies that
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
offer things that are based in what they
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
call the science of reading however
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
the science of reading from what I am
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
able to gather appears to act as
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
something akin to a cartel that is
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
designed to legitimize a certain set of
 
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.470 align:start position:0%
designed to legitimize a certain set of
science

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that was quite good I went
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
down I listened to
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's a company amplify puts
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
out a podcast called science of reading
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
the podcast I listen to I listened to
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
most of about half a dozen episodes and
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
they a lot of it was quite good
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
however there was some stuff I found in
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
there that they seem to be legitimating
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
under the term the science of reading
 
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
that I found highly objectionable these
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
things include a need for
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
socio-political activism within the
 
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.569 align:start position:0%
socio-political activism within the
classroom

00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
there was an entire episode that was
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
unadulterated critical race Theory there
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
is all kinds of other stuff being done
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell under the banner of
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
Science of reading
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
so my concern is if we're
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
if we're using that language
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
that and we're not trying to point to
 
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
any particular set of
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
set of information that might be linked
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
to any particular company or anything
 
00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:46.670 align:start position:0%
to any particular company or anything
else

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
I would love to see just a very minor
 
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:50.089 align:start position:0%
I would love to see just a very minor
Amendment

00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
to change the language science of
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
reading to something that makes it very
 
00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:57.500 align:start position:0%
clear that we're looking for a
 
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.210 align:start position:0%
clear that we're looking for a
evidence-based

00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
set of research
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
in general as opposed to something that
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be as I said something
 
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
that came to a cartel to legitimate a
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
certain subset of science that includes
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
things that I don't think are
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
needing to be in the classroom
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent miler
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh president cordelli
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
is it your intent
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
that this amendment of 437
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
would take the place of HB 377 and and
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
Mr chair before we voted this we'd like
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
the caucus to talk about this once we
 
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead that's a question yes
 
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.049 align:start position:0%
go ahead that's a question yes
um

00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:54.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
I wanted to try and incorporate 377 so
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
that we had one consistent piece of
 
00:59:00.059 --> 00:59:01.609 align:start position:0%
that we had one consistent piece of
legislation

00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
um whether 377 could go forward
 
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.530 align:start position:0%
um whether 377 could go forward
separately

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
separately
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I I would see it possibly being
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
retained as a backup
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
um because who knows what will happen
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
with this Bill thank you
 
00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:17.579 align:start position:0%
ref Santana then representative Cascade
 
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
and we'll just float around that side
 
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.089 align:start position:0%
and we'll just float around that side
yeah

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
um as working on 377
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
and trying to you know everything's
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
going on trying to to see the screening
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
and interventions for dyslexia that one
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
where you say 377 is incorporated and
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
I see some uh differences from what we
 
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.670 align:start position:0%
I see some uh differences from what we
had

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.510 align:start position:0%
had
um

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the in our bill
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
um one of them was that they didn't just
 
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
do one testing they did
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
um you have the testing shall be
 
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
administered during the second half of
 
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and during the first 60
 
00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.069 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and during the first 60
days

00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
for first and second grades and
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
evidently not third the screening shall
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
be appropriate at times thereafter and
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
we've asked for at least two screenings
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
for dyslexia I think during the time
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the big ones I the
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
the two intense of 377 was one to have
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
more screening for dyslexia than
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
currently it happens and the other one
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
was that when a child is determined to
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
have substantial issues or dyslexia that
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
intervention starts immediately rather
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
than wait
 
01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure that
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
that those two issues that were key to
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
377 are included in here
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about the the financial
 
01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.270 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about the the financial
note

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
um there's there's no
 
01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.609 align:start position:0%
um there's there's no
um

01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.329 --> 01:00:55.339 align:start position:0%
I think the financial uh part of it
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
changes a little bit with your Amendment
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh how it's well the amendment I don't
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
think has a financial mess with it does
 
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.490 align:start position:0%
think has a financial mess with it does
it

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:01:09.849 --> 01:01:09.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes and in the financial note that says
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
it will use
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
if you look on the Amendment analysis it
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
has on the on the last page
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
the flip over page
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
um that it establishes procedures for
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
screening and using Dibbles so that has
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
to be changed if that's not your intent
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
you're right I did not have any control
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
over the analysis uh I'm not sure who
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
put that in there
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I guarantee you it wasn't me okay and
 
01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if the the
 
01:01:46.329 --> 01:01:46.339 align:start position:0%
financial part of it uh where you have
 
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
in part on line 30 on
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
um page four where you go for the
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
Appropriations there yep
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
um different than what is currently in
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
the appropriation was
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
um to provide funds for the Department
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
of Education to acquire that Universal
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
screening that would do both the reading
 
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
because it would be offered as a
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide statement excuse me Statewide
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
tool since we're going to use that as a
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
measure for the reading Improvement
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
Grants I felt there had to be a common
 
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.190 align:start position:0%
Grants I felt there had to be a common
base

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
base
 
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:39.140 align:start position:0%
just um the repeal of RSA 198 48
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
relatively Grant amounts for
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
non-proficient people reading is
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
repealed does that mean that there will
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
no longer be a grant that that is for
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
the differentiated Aid that would now be
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
replaced by the reading Improvement
 
01:02:53.339 --> 01:02:54.349 align:start position:0%
replaced by the reading Improvement
Grant

01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
the differentiated aid grant is just for
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
a subset of students at I think it's 740
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
dollars per student
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
um the reading Improvement Grant goes up
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
to a thousand dollars per student and
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
will would cover all those with a
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
deficiency okay so that's that's still
 
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.930 align:start position:0%
deficiency okay so that's that's still
yes

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
um could I address well let's go around
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
and then do a little summary after
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you um I still need this question
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
answered as to why we need 437 and 377.
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
and I asked that question
 
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.770 align:start position:0%
and I asked that question
um

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
because I've been able to
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
come up with some facts on some
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
practical experience that for some
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
reason it just doesn't make sense to me
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
but if if it should pass then I want to
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
know why
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
just to give you a little bit of history
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
and some clarity of course I've been
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
trained in re teaching reading taught
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
reading of supervised reading I've
 
01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:57.020 align:start position:0%
evaluated reading Specialists
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
in historically the national reading
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
panel in 2005 came out with the science
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
of the evidence-based components that
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
are required to teach reading and those
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
are the same that are documented in your
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
bill it's phonics phonemic awareness
 
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:19.140 align:start position:0%
fluency vocabulary and comprehension
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
and after 2005 then there was a big
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
National push in 2006 seven
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
to train teachers
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
to do Universal screeners for our
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
looking at dyslexic characteristics or
 
01:04:34.559 --> 01:04:36.230 align:start position:0%
looking at dyslexic characteristics or
indicators

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
indicators
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
because another fact is dyslexia is only
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as a specific learning
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
disability if there is a discrepancy
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
between the academic testing and the IQ
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
which is usually a risk and if there is
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
a high and a low then the team would
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
identify specific learning disability is
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
dyslexia but what we wanted to do after
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
2005 is not wait for that point but to
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
be able to screen in kindergarten first
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
and second grade at least three times a
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
year and then provide direct
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
intervention to the student if they were
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
showing some of those signs and it's not
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
just one test you got to think of how to
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
measure all five components
 
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
so Dibbles was an early
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
tool that now if there are people still
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
using the old Dibbles they should know
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
that it's not as highly or strongly
 
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.970 align:start position:0%
that it's not as highly or strongly
correlated

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
correlated
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
with measuring those
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
characteristic of someone who may be
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
dyslexic and again it's never really
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
clear until interventions have been
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
provided in K and one and two either in
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
small in whole group small group or
 
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.910 align:start position:0%
small in whole group small group or
individual

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
and if there's documentation Say by mid
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
second grade that all this has been
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
provided and this child is still not say
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
passing Iran which is the rabbit uh the
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
rapid not the rabbit but the rapid
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
automated naming which is one of the
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
very first ones you know it's just rapid
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
naming because it's Norm by age so
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
they're wrapping naming uh letters and
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
then it progresses to numbers and then
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
it progresses to colors
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
the Kilpatrick phonological awareness is
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
another piece of that screening because
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's measuring phonemes do kids know
 
01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:26.339 align:start position:0%
that b is going to say
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
um can they put back together by
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
connecting the phonemes bat
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
so that's another screener and then some
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
um are using star which measures all
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
five pieces or aims web which measures
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
all different pieces or they have five
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
subsets or the new Dibbles now is a
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
Cadence which is being used and so I
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
talked to a lot of people in the North
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
country in this why do we need that
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing that
 
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:01.460 align:start position:0%
so I went back to the 200 I would say
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
259 uh colon 59 that was the screening
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
the first uh law and the first line says
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
school districts shell screen all public
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
school students
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking well it's here
 
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:21.140 align:start position:0%
but then I go to the reading specialist
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
pursue it to that the doe will secure a
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
contract Service of a reading specialist
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
to enable
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
to gather the data on schools to support
 
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.170 align:start position:0%
to gather the data on schools to support
schools

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
and so that's when we asked for the
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
report that is done
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
and in that report
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
their names a reading specialist that
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
was contracted to develop this wonderful
 
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.150 align:start position:0%
was contracted to develop this wonderful
tool

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
tool
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
that has all kinds of information it is
 
01:07:50.039 --> 01:07:51.770 align:start position:0%
that has all kinds of information it is
helpful

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
but the person named in the
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner's report is not in the
 
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment page
 
01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to pursue that and the
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
contract the person who led this charge
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
is a different person so I don't know if
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
what's identified in the report to
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
develop this guide if that person or
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
contracted service was part of this
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
but people on this committee
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
tell me it was somebody different
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
and from what I understand I wish it was
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
a doe person here
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
um there's a language arts teacher
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
a great resource
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
but it's like having your family doctor
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
as a practitioner and then a reading
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
specialist being the equivalent of a
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
cardiologist a specialist
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
so again there isn't that clear-cut
 
01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
specialized support yet
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
and I think I mentioned to
 
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli the other day it
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
seems like we should be pushing for a
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
full-time doe person who is a
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
experienced reading specialist
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
this law is trying to correct a problem
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
of some districts
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
that are not screening for dyslexia
 
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
shame on them but is it because their
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
budgets don't allow them to engage in
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
purchasing these materials and the
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
software license that is pretty costly
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
for the Analytics
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
and then can they purchase the
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
intervention tools
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
and I would want somebody first of all
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
to get an inventory of that because we
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
might be talking of only a handful of
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
districts and what's the reason I mean
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
shame on leadership if they're not
 
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
moving in that direction and selecting
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
other programs in their budget over
 
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:40.100 align:start position:0%
screening and reading interventions
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
parents need to be a part of this and
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
the way they need to be a part of it is
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
preschool skills
 
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
parents need to be working with nursery
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
rhymes for kids it's as simple as that
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
and when they don't have that once they
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
come to kindergarten they're learning
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
rhyming and sounding from scratch
 
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:03.860 align:start position:0%
so there is a Continuum of service here
 
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
and again I would definitely like to see
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
the RSA on the books enforced because
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's so necessary
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
the data right now I think is too early
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
to say yes the scores are much lower but
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
we only had one year Beyond covet I
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
think I don't think it's a fair enough
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
assessment but if all schools in New
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were doing these screenings
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
had the materials they select the
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
screening whether it's Ames webstar ran
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
for name you know the path whatever it
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
is if it does the measuring then they
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
should be able to know how to decide as
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
a team what intervention and some
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
interventions are pretty expensive and
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
they require training I mean letters
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
training that's being offered
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
currently by the department of Ed has
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
gotten an overwhelming response thank
 
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
gotten an overwhelming response thank
goodness

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
goodness
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
our staffs trained in it in 2007 as well
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
as myself
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
so yes it took what 15 years for it to
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
catch up
 
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know but it's the right thing to
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
do for sure and a Wilson program is more
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
on a one-on-one
 
01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:07.669 align:start position:0%
on a one-on-one
um

01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
intervention but there are several and
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
people have to be careful because like
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher said I mean
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
marketing certain companies and products
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that they have the
 
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.450 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that they have the
answers

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
answers
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
but you have to be Savvy about that in
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
the 2000s a lot of school districts went
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
to whole language and they dropped
 
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
phonics but we never dropped phonics
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
because we were old school but guess
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
what as representative Ladd said that
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
pendulum went right back and guess what
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
we need specific phonics direct
 
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
instruction and so hey we never left
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
that bandwagon but a lot of districts
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
did but I'd want to know who needs help
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the for enforcing this law and
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have a hundred
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
percent full-time Personnel that can
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
take that inventory and support training
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
in schools money always thank you thank
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
you very much uh that's that's
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
informative and it kind of Echoes what I
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
experienced as a school principal
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I'd have I recall one IEP meeting
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
which we had and we had a student that
 
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:15.140 align:start position:0%
was in our uh
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
it was very very bright boy
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
but he had difficulty in this area of
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
reading and identifying the various
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
aspects these skills and influencing all
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
that when we gave him the Wexler
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
the score was 139
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
and in our school give or take a couple
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
points around 130 they were admitted
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
into the gifted program
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
and and then when you had a room full of
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
10 of these gifted students it's like
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
you walked onto the moon the type of
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
discussion you were hearing and where we
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
where they were going
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
but you know in this particular case
 
01:12:57.610 --> 01:12:57.620 align:start position:0%
this student did have dyslexia
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
significantly and it was verified
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
through that difference that learning
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
disability between the IQ score and the
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
what was being performed
 
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
and so there's there's a lot to there's
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of different ways to assessing
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
that as well so um thank you very much
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
for your going through your what you're
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
doing the school
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative cardelli
 
01:13:20.159 --> 01:13:21.709 align:start position:0%
yes representative cardelli
um

01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
a few things I'm not quite sure where to
 
01:13:24.239 --> 01:13:25.669 align:start position:0%
a few things I'm not quite sure where to
start

01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I take great exception
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
to people who
 
01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
um got together to try and put together
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
some of this research and call them a
 
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.430 align:start position:0%
some of this research and call them a
cartel

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
cartel
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
that is inflammatory and out of line I
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
think for to call professionals who are
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
trying to improve literacy in this
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
country a cartel
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I take great exception to that to
 
01:13:58.570 --> 01:13:58.580 align:start position:0%
um say that something is not
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based research or a program
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
because it has a capital S instead of a
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
small S I have no clue as to why we're
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
going in that direction
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
equate this with critical race Theory
 
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:18.500 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about here you know
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
I I'm just flabbergasted
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
um uh the bill says on page two line
 
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.729 align:start position:0%
um uh the bill says on page two line
eight

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:27.739 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading instructional
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
programming that the teacher will use to
 
01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.490 align:start position:0%
programming that the teacher will use to
provide

01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about that's
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about we're not
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
talking about critical race Theory we're
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
talking about improving literacy
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
seeing

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
one word
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
in one of 5.7 million articles
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
is not going to change the purpose of
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here to improve
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
literacy we want to make sure that
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
everybody is using a screener that is
 
01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.510 align:start position:0%
everybody is using a screener that is
evidence-based

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.850 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
um

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:09.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
and as you said representative cascadden
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what screeners are all
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
being used but we're trying to put in
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
place here and provide funding for a
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
universal screening that does just that
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
determining deficiencies
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
and providing recommendations for how to
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
get around those deficiencies or how to
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
provide interventions to correct those
 
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.689 align:start position:0%
provide interventions to correct those
deficiencies

01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:39.370 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
um

01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:39.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
and in terms of reading specialist there
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
was a separate bill to deal with reading
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
Specialists because in statute now as
 
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
you pointed out is just a contract
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
Service and we want to make sure that um
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
that is not the only option for the
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
Department to have
 
01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.490 align:start position:0%
Department to have
um

01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it there for now further
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes represent Balboni
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
um this is kind of just a simple
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
question really
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
um do you have down that the screening
 
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
device will be chosen by January 1st
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
2024 and I would think with any
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
screening device that's been chosen
 
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
there will have to be teacher training
 
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:21.020 align:start position:0%
on how to use if
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a specific one that's
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to be used Statewide and yet at
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
the end it says the bill will take
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passage so I'm a
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
little confused with your timing and
 
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
making sure that if you do go this route
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
with a universal screener that there's
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
adequate time for their teacher training
 
01:16:39.659 --> 01:16:41.149 align:start position:0%
adequate time for their teacher training
right

01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think that
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the the effective date was
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
um a start that
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
um the department had to get moving on
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh the process of selecting the screener
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
and start the whole process not that
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
um uh everyone had to be up and running
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
within 60 days with a new screener
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
president miler
 
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I would I would
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
concur with uh representative cordell's
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
comments about
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
but he just said
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
the question I guess that I'm raising is
 
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
I don't hear any disagreement within the
 
01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
I don't hear any disagreement within the
committee

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
around the con the the concept of the
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
need here
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
what I what I am concerned about is
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
much of what the representative
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
cascadden said is that we don't really
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
have the data
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
on who's doing what and uh how it's
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
currently taking place out into the
 
01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.850 align:start position:0%
currently taking place out into the
field

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering Mr chair
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
whether or not again this might be a
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
bill that we might want to retain
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
and really have I mean we've had a we
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
had serious work on special ed issues
 
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
when they came before us
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
and does this fall into the same kind of
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
category where we can get further data I
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not I'm not negating the need
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
here at all
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm concerned about
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
making sure we understand what the
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
current state of the art is
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
within school districts
 
01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:19.850 align:start position:0%
within school districts
and

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
um again what representative cascadden
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
was saying to really look at that and to
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
see what the incident rate is what
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
issues are being what are the variety of
 
01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
options for screening Etc are being used
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
out there because obviously school
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
districts have the authority to select
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
how they want to address this particular
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
issue and I just feel like I don't have
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
enough information
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
to really move on this at this point in
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
time although I totally recognize the
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
need for this and so that I guess it's a
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
question to you Mr chair about whether
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
or not it would be appropriate to retain
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
this bill and really do some a further
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
look at this thing and bring it back
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
before this committee once we have more
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
data I hear what you're saying
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Miler
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
um it kind of Echoes a little bit of
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
what we had a discussion with remember
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
we were we recommended that there be a d
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
o e analyst
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
and the purpose for this analyst was to
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
get down and do that really look at the
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
Deep dive into our Statewide assessment
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
and determine where we what we're doing
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
and to assist the schools in our their
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
better understanding how they might try
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
to see Improvement in some of these
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
subjects I.E reading and Mathematics and
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
language arts the other components of
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
language arts
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
um we don't have that information and
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
when we look at this right here
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
in the 2018
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
formula a funding committee which we had
 
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
to study the education funding and the
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
cost for an opportunity for an adequate
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
education I'm going to read you one line
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
right now and this the bill we have in
 
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
front of you representative cordelli is
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
addressing exactly what was stated there
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
in that bill the dollars that were set
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
aside for children who are in third
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
grade and reading below proficient level
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
has not proven to be a way to improve
 
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.229 align:start position:0%
has not proven to be a way to improve
proficiency

01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
so that that task force back then saw
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
that those reading dollars really aren't
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
achieving what we need to achieve and
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
then also support representative
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
cascadden and saying shame on those
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
districts which are not doing this
 
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.850 align:start position:0%
districts which are not doing this
um

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
I can't believe that there's some
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
districts that wouldn't be doing this
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
right now it's just unbelievable to me
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
that that there might be supervisors in
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
a building or principals allowing that
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
to happen and sitting there on top of uh
 
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
non-profition students and not really
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
doing that deep dive
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have the staff to do it
 
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have the expertise to
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
do it but there are students being
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
shoved through the cracks so I I agree
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
in many aspects of that I don't want to
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
get too specific in something like this
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
we know that we have the issues of
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
a fluency fluency vocabulary phonemic
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
patterns phonics comprehension
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I won't go through with that litany
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
again that all that but
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
I see it and there are a lot of
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
different ways of addressing this I
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
would say uh however uh some districts
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
apparently must need that help but we
 
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
don't know which ones those are other
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
than until we get that deep dive into
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
the analytics on it and also have the
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
absolute Specialists that are going to
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
be able to go beyond and and get into
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
the real understandings of what it's
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
going to take to improve these
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
youngsters be better readers our
 
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
students so
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
where we are with that question whether
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's better to retain right now
 
01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
it's better to retain right now
um

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
um or to try to do something quickly
 
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.990 align:start position:0%
um or to try to do something quickly
here

01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm always fearful of trying to do
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
some quickly
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
even though we have a lot of there's so
 
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
much good meat in this
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
however there are also those issues
 
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
which brought up today so I guess you
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
know I I'd let your caucus figure that
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
one out where you go on this and and uh
 
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
um even on page one I'm looking at
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
letter naming fluency phonetic awareness
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
decoding fluency word reading fluency
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
oral reading fluency and reading
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
comprehension and vocabulary
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
vocabulous not mentioned
 
01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:51.430 align:start position:0%
vocabulous not mentioned
um

01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
yeah and I know you can respond that
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
because if you go to the other Pages it
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
is it is
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah very much so you just go to page
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
three at the top uh Romans 6 as
 
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh so
 
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.070 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh so
um

01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm alone between this one
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
myself but I I think if I had to come
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
right down on it now if we weren't going
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
to do it I think we need to do something
 
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
I really do and this might be the
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
vehicle to do it and there's lots of
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
room to change things as we go on the
 
01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:23.420 align:start position:0%
process eruption
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick comment you know on the
 
01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
department of Ed website where this
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
guide is there are there's some there's
 
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
some FAQs
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
um and it asks if the law requires
 
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
school districts to identify students
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
who have dyslexia and the answer is no
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
because again those screeners and those
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
all those
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
screeners pre-third grade are not to
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
identify their to rule out
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
characteristics and look for risk
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
factors and it says the law requires
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
school districts to screen for potential
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
risk factors of Dyslexia and Related
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
Disorders and identify students who will
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
receive interventions based on those
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
risk factors period
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that that's any different
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
than the than the bill but I'm still
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
looking for that clarity
 
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock
 
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
um just a question uh some of the stuff
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
that comes up in review of the reading
 
01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:23.219 align:start position:0%
the science of reading I was talking to
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
the National Council of teacher quality
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
stuff it's talking about the obviously
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
the five pillars of the critical pieces
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're saying that only 51 uh at least in
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
2020 of teacher prep programs are using
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
the science of reading as the base for
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the teaching of reading so I was curious
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
two things one for uh Dr Chris cadden uh
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
and one generally for our upper level
 
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:50.780 align:start position:0%
the first one was in our New Hampshire
 
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
teacher prep programs are we currently
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
are they currently teaching the science
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
of reading uh my first question uh my
 
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
second pot is if uh half of the teacher
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
prepped across the country on it are we
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and then secondly that
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
was sort of to you who's the council the
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
second to Dr cascadden when
 
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:18.260 align:start position:0%
superintendents do uh interviews uh for
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
elementary people is it traditional to
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
have ask uh specific question generated
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
towards their reading expertise and
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
diagnostic expertise it's not a two-part
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
one for one for the two leads here
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
you and Dr kestan do you know what we're
 
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:35.300 align:start position:0%
doing in the college over here
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
I can address the issue uh uh as working
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
with higher education post-secondary
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
education right we've had when we've had
 
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education in for a number
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
of topics uh uh one we're seeing a
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of teachers coming
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
out of the education institutions in our
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
state for various reasons we see the
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage the the question you're
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
asking though what is being done in the
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
area of teaching reading in the most
 
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
secondary level right I can't answer
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
that but you know what we discussed the
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
other day on the oversight committee for
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
improvement and assessment is that we
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to see you know a look into
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
social studies mathematics I don't think
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
we mentioned reading at a time but it is
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
it's just looking into what we're doing
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
K-12 but also K through 16. yeah and
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to be looking I do
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
not know what's going on in the
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the down the
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
dean was at our last meeting from UNH uh
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
that this question wasn't asked perhaps
 
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's a good question for us to ask and
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
try to find out what do they have in
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
these syllabus is that they're teaching
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
over there right now
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and how are they doing it and I don't
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
have that answer it's something we need
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
to find out the second part of Dr
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
cascaden could answer that for me in
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
terms of typical if you would uh
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh thinking or
 
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
interviewing questionnaires for
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
youngsters the teacher qualities at that
 
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
time helmetic pieces Mr chair I all set
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
to answer him yes okay uh yes absolutely
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I was principal of three schools at
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
the same time with no assistant and yes
 
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
um reading and really drilling down on
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
how much practical experience I've had
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
in that field but looking at higher ed
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
okay to six teachers who are
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
studying to be an elementary teacher
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
have to take foundations of reading
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
but then as they go through their
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
program after a semester two they're
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
required to take a basic reading math
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
standardized test call the Praxis one
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
then before they graduate if they don't
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
pass that they can't go on in the
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
program then they have to take a after
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
semester seven they have to take a
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
standardized test on science social
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
studies math and reading
 
01:27:59.810 --> 01:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
and if they don't pass that they can't
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
go on in the program
 
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
and then to get licensed and certified
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
they must take a standardized test
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
called foundations of reading very
 
01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.970 align:start position:0%
called foundations of reading very
specialized

01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
specialized
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
um PSU they have to have 600 hours of
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
classroom observation 70 days of an
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
internship what we know of student
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
teaching UNH has a five-year program
 
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
where a student teacher potentially
 
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
works with a teacher for a full year and
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
graduates with a master's so their
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
teachers are trained and licensed to
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
teach children how to read and provide
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
intervention plans when necessary what's
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
concerning again is
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
the law says they need to do it why
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
aren't they doing it
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you both
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative it's a fair to say that
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
the instruction that they're receiving
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
at the post-secondary level is that
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
there's there are a number of methods
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
used in the teaching of reading uh a
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
number of ways to do it we kind of you
 
01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
know as Educators have gone with that
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
pendulum all over the board we seem to
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
think that when it goes over here that's
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
the best way to do whatever task we're
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing and we forget about
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
some of the proven ways that have been
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
effective in the past uh is that sort of
 
01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
what might be happening is that you know
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
as we've gone with other subjects like
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
mathematics and the sciences and all
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
we've gone over there and we've dropped
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
that is that what's going on in Reading
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
two at this time
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
well again when I go back to 2005 that's
 
01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
what 15 years ago
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's why none of this is new to me so
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
what people have done in between say
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
from 2000 and 11 12 to now in the last
 
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
10 years I you know I don't know because
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
I still interviewed
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
um candidates right up until 2019 and I
 
01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
those pieces have to be in there yeah
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
thank you and represent Tanner
 
01:29:54.179 --> 01:29:54.830 align:start position:0%
thank you and represent Tanner
um

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh I believe at one point there was talk
 
01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
of a an RFP to to examine what was going
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
on in higher ed teacher instruction I'm
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
not sure what the status of that is
 
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.530 align:start position:0%
not sure what the status of that is
um but

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
um this all is a follow-on to an
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
initiative from the Department
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
um from April of 2022 the Leaning into
 
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.290 align:start position:0%
um from April of 2022 the Leaning into
literacy

01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
literacy
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
program that was started by the
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
um by the department and they contracted
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
um with these letters
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and I think you mentioned it um
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative to train 9 000 people
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
in the basically the science of reading
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
and this new
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
um idea or this resurrected idea from
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
research on how to teach children how to
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
read so
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
01:30:54.169 --> 01:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
been going on and I know people who've
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
signed up to read a former member of
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
this committee signed up to take the
 
01:30:59.330 --> 01:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
letters training
 
01:31:02.209 --> 01:31:02.219 align:start position:0%
um just because she was interested
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
um so this is an outgrowth of that and a
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
continuation of that building upon that
 
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.550 align:start position:0%
continuation of that building upon that
initiative

01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.149 align:start position:0%
initiative
um

01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
and I hope we can continue building to
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Belcher
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
um first I I would certainly promote
 
01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
every every member of this committee to
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
fully do whatever research on whatever
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
bill that comes across us necessary to
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
fully understand what it is we're
 
01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
passing on this particular bill
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how many hours I spent
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
delving into specifics it was quite a
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
few I've read hundreds of pages from
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
multiple organizations and multiple
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
companies I've listened to hours upon
 
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
hours of podcasts a particular podcast
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
not just any podcast it's a podcast
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
podcast called the science of reading
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
the podcast that is produced by the
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
reading league and amplify amplify was
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
the company whose handout was provided
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
to all of us when this bill was
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
introduced so there is a Nexus here it's
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
not it's not just Somewhere Out In The
 
01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.810 align:start position:0%
not it's not just Somewhere Out In The
Ether

01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
Ether
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
um now I would certainly not Levy any
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
accusations that anybody on this
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
community is trying to do anything wrong
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
with this I don't think they are I think
 
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
we all want to help kids read I want I
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
think we want it put in place what is
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
necessary to do that
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I would note podcast season two
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
episode four that is where you will find
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
an entire episode that is uh around
 
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
um season two episode three is where
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
they describe how this science of
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
reading was formulated in the first in
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
the first place these various
 
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
organizations that come together to
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
create this body of research now I am a
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
hundred percent behind using good
 
01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:54.590 align:start position:0%
hundred percent behind using good
science

01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
to inform our teaching methods to help
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
children learn to read better
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
we've heard that there is no particular
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
program called the science of reading
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
if we're not trying to direct our
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
schools to anything in particular
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't see why it would be a
 
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
problem whatsoever if we just changed
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
science of reading to what it actually
 
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do which is
 
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
something akin to
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
evidence based or researched Based
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
Teaching methodologies or pedagogical
 
01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.649 align:start position:0%
Teaching methodologies or pedagogical
methods

01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
methods
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
um it seems like an easy fix here for me
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
effective representative Tanner
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you I just would like to not
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
forget the dyslexia part of this and
 
01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.709 align:start position:0%
forget the dyslexia part of this and
dyslexia

01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
dyslexia
 
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I believe was after 2005 that that
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
the real push came
 
01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
um to to measure to to test kids for
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and realize that as the reading
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
specialist told us that dyslexic kids
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
can can are so smart that they can cover
 
01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
the fact that they can't read and that
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
it it may take a couple of testing uh
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
trials and also testing ways
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
to discover their disability and then
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
when it's discovered it needs immediate
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
intervention and that's what 377 is all
 
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
about that's why it's developed and and
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the fact that it's been
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
tried to to put in 377 and into this
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
bill but I think it should be Standalone
 
01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:37.850 align:start position:0%
bill but I think it should be Standalone
and

01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
um I think we we need the extra testing
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
and we need the the intervention
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
um immediate so that would be my thought
 
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
on this representative cordelli thank
 
01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:50.209 align:start position:0%
on this representative cordelli thank
you

01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:50.219 --> 01:34:51.669 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh I reject the straw man argument of
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
the science of reading it's a straw man
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
come on
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
um you know it's you know if
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
if you're going to use
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
the term as a reason for voting against
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
this bill be honest about it say you
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
um in terms of um
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
incorporating 377 in here all the
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
intervention is part of it it's not
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to be intervention just for
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
reading but dyslexia also it's it's all
 
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
part of the intervention and the
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the parents everybody's
 
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
got to be involved for any kind of
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
reading deficiencies I think and that's
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's why I I tried to merge it in here
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:35:46.679 --> 01:35:48.890 align:start position:0%
as well
um

01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're getting pretty close
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the end of our you know we're kind of
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
starting to repeat a little bit so what
 
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
we need to do is we need to take a break
 
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%
and have a caucus from both sides on
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
um one thing I do want us to note that
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
we did get into the discussion
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock you're inquiring
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
about post-secondary education and
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
what's going on there and represent
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
cascadden did respond to that but on
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
page three of the amendment under Roman
 
01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.350 align:start position:0%
page three of the amendment under Roman
8

01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
8
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
item D there is reference to the annual
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
report that comes in from the Department
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire teacher preparation
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
programs implementation of reading
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
instructional programs so it does
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
reference to we should be getting
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
information back from post-secondary
 
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
education as well so that's a real
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
positive Point within this bill yep
 
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
so what we will do is we will take a
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
caucus here and um
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come back how much time
 
01:36:51.169 --> 01:36:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
to about uh 11 30 11 30. yeah
 
01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:58.250 align:start position:0%
to about uh 11 30 11 30. yeah
yeah

01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so we will caucus
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a separate bill so that's that
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
there has to be it has discussion on yes
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
because it is a bill we have in New
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay we are now back in in session
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at HB 437
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment to 437
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
and we just broke our caucus
 
01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.850 align:start position:0%
and we just broke our caucus
um

01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we got to assess
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether we're ready to move forward as a
 
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
total committee on this or for whether
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
the other option is representative Milo
 
01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
you so you're at the position would you
 
01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.209 --> 01:59:14.219 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:59:14.219 --> 01:59:15.709 align:start position:0%
so with that
um

01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
I think that rather than going down this
 
01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
a vote at this point in time can we uh
 
01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
form a
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
a small group
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
um we have the option retaining it or is
 
01:59:40.609 --> 01:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
feeling amongst your group that it might
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
be able to be written in a way that it
 
01:59:48.649 --> 01:59:48.659 align:start position:0%
could move forward so
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
we believe more information needs to be
 
01:59:52.970 --> 01:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
gathered on okay so you're absolutely on
 
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay so I I guess where we're going to
 
02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
go is we're just going to follow this
 
02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
through then with taking action today on
 
02:00:05.219 --> 02:00:06.709 align:start position:0%
through then with taking action today on
this

02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
so we have an amendment on the floor
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh is there any further discussion on
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:18.900 align:start position:0%

the statute that is being repealed
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
um was not changed to remove the words
 
02:07:22.129 --> 02:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian and is is really not
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
needed since it is covered in 193.3
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%

have to add that extra year of age 21 do
 
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
we know what the cost is going to be for

what we heard from doe testimony this is
 
02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
already in practice uh so I don't think
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
it would result in any increase
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
we we did get those exact figures given
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
to us last year and it was really
 
02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
to us last year and it was really
minimal

02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%

02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.250 --> 02:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.330 --> 02:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
well even we just eliminate two right
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
and then you can leave the rest yeah
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's housekeeping we can do that as
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
well but then this 189 1A still has
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian types going there
 
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
it just you you just don't touch section
 
02:14:15.770 --> 02:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
section two just goes
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
right but but the purpose of the you
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
know was to remove that because it's
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
right because non-sectarian private
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%

03:20:16.990 --> 03:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:23.330 --> 03:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to go ahead with this
 
03:20:26.570 --> 03:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
afternoon's exact sessions here and the
 
03:20:29.290 --> 03:20:29.300 align:start position:0%
first bill that we have up here is
 
03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
hb102 require high school students to
 
03:20:32.279 --> 03:20:33.290 align:start position:0%
hb102 require high school students to
include

03:20:33.290 --> 03:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:20:36.410 --> 03:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh to include instruction on the nature
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:43.790 --> 03:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at one zero two and I'd
 
03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
like to recommend represent cordelli
 
03:20:48.290 --> 03:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
recognize representative cordelli for
 
03:20:48.300 --> 03:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
recognize representative cordelli for
emotion

03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.889 --> 03:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
I would move not to pass
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher says yes second
 
03:21:02.450 --> 03:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
Madam cleric you got that it's cordelli
 
03:21:02.460 --> 03:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
Madam cleric you got that it's cordelli
Belcher

03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
03:21:07.849 --> 03:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:11.450 --> 03:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
um yes I I think that uh
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
um probably the original bill
 
03:21:17.710 --> 03:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
um takes a little bit different tact
 
03:21:22.610 --> 03:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
than than I would have um uh written and
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
I think that there is an amendment to be
 
03:21:24.720 --> 03:21:29.690 align:start position:0%
I think that there is an amendment to be
offered

03:21:29.690 --> 03:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative electus or Belcher you
 
03:21:34.910 --> 03:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr chair I would like to
 
03:21:38.590 --> 03:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
introduce Amendment
 
03:21:42.050 --> 03:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
2023-0312h on this bill I believe
 
03:21:43.550 --> 03:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
everyone should have a copy in front of
 
03:21:44.690 --> 03:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
them this bill
 
03:21:48.610 --> 03:21:48.620 align:start position:0%
um everybody have a copy in front of you
 
03:21:51.349 --> 03:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay so this amendment radically changes
 
03:21:52.730 --> 03:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
the language of the build actually
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
completely removes all existing language
 
03:21:56.809 --> 03:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it takes existing
 
03:21:56.819 --> 03:21:58.070 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it takes existing
law

03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:22:03.290 --> 03:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
as to how we are educating about certain
 
03:22:04.969 --> 03:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
um issues such as intolerance and
 
03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
bigotry and other things that can cause
 
03:22:10.370 --> 03:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
hatred and it adds just one single word
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
the word class because historically we
 
03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
have seen targeting of certain
 
03:22:17.030 --> 03:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
populations based on class Dynamics as
 
03:22:20.090 --> 03:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
opposed to other things and I believe
 
03:22:24.170 --> 03:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
that that achieves perhaps something of
 
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
the original intent of the nature of the
 
03:22:29.150 --> 03:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
bill while making it I think far more
 
03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:36.889 --> 03:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
further just so I
 
03:22:40.370 --> 03:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
you're putting forward the amendment
 
03:22:45.170 --> 03:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:48.410 --> 03:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
yes yes is there a second
 
03:22:48.420 --> 03:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
yes yes is there a second
representative

03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:49.920 --> 03:22:51.230 align:start position:0%
representative
okay

03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking out zero three one two H
 
03:23:00.530 --> 03:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment for one zero two
 
03:23:04.010 --> 03:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's put forth by represent Belcher and
 
03:23:06.290 --> 03:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
second by representative Lucas because
 
03:23:07.610 --> 03:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
the other the first motion though
 
03:23:09.889 --> 03:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't get reported the first motion
 
03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
was octopass for the bill
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
and who made represent cardelli made
 
03:23:19.490 --> 03:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
that and was second by represent Belcher
 
03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
we got into discussion and the
 
03:23:24.290 --> 03:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
discussions brought up this amendment
 
03:23:26.809 --> 03:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
and now we're at on the amendment right
 
03:23:30.410 --> 03:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
here we're discussing the amended
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
version of 102.
 
03:23:37.010 --> 03:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
03:23:39.349 --> 03:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion on one on the
 
03:23:40.550 --> 03:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
amendment for one zero two
 
03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:45.410 align:start position:0%
amendment for one zero two
representative

03:23:45.410 --> 03:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:45.420 --> 03:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.889 --> 03:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
really trying to do is lessen or
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
preferably eliminate some of these
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
hatred discrimination
 
03:24:03.050 --> 03:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
genocide Mass violence Etc
 
03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
so teaching about the causes can be very
 
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
important and one
 
03:24:13.610 --> 03:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
we notice that one cause is missing that
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
has come up throughout history going way
 
03:24:18.889 --> 03:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
back and that's class
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
so adding that in because that is still
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
across the world an issue in certain
 
03:24:27.610 --> 03:24:27.620 align:start position:0%
places so we added that so
 
03:24:31.490 --> 03:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher added that in
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:43.370 --> 03:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
we have a caucus request we will break
 
03:24:50.050 --> 03:24:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:58.849 --> 03:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.370 --> 03:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go ahead and and continue with
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
this executive session on one zero two
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh we have an amendment on the floor the
 
03:39:08.690 --> 03:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh motion on the floor for the amount
 
03:39:10.610 --> 03:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
was ought to pass is there a discussion
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Miler yes uh
 
03:39:13.560 --> 03:39:15.710 align:start position:0%
representative Miler yes uh
representative

03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher could you define
 
03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:25.010 --> 03:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
sure I'm glad you actually give the
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do this because I meant
 
03:39:28.729 --> 03:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
to do it earlier so a class I'll give
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
you a perfect example of what class
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
would mean for instance during during
 
03:39:33.410 --> 03:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
World War II
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
um the ukrainians were targeted as a
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
class being called kulux the certain
 
03:39:41.650 --> 03:39:41.660 align:start position:0%
class involved was the peasant farmers
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
and they were starved to the tune of
 
03:39:44.399 --> 03:39:45.710 align:start position:0%
and they were starved to the tune of
millions

03:39:45.710 --> 03:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
millions
 
03:39:47.389 --> 03:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
um in this incident so class can be
 
03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
broken down generally as it's generally
 
03:39:52.130 --> 03:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
considered based on
 
03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
um wealth or ownership but not
 
03:39:58.250 --> 03:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.250 --> 03:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
well if I may yes one of the one of the
 
03:40:09.950 --> 03:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
concerns we have is that obviously the
 
03:40:13.010 --> 03:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
current language that's in the India law
 
03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
was developed uh with the
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
input of a social science teachers Etc
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
and so we have some concern as it
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
relates to uh the current
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
review of the 306 rules dealing with
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum and we know that that's going
 
03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
through right now I mean we kind of had
 
03:40:39.050 --> 03:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
that when we talked about cursive
 
03:40:41.090 --> 03:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
writing as another in mathematics we
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
talked about that a little bit too so we
 
03:40:45.370 --> 03:40:45.380 align:start position:0%
have some concern about
 
03:40:49.729 --> 03:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
preempting uh a review by those who are
 
03:40:51.530 --> 03:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
actually involved of teaching this
 
03:40:53.210 --> 03:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
particular subject so that's those
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's that some of those are the two
 
03:40:56.090 --> 03:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
concerns that I think that we basically
 
03:40:58.190 --> 03:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
came up with
 
03:41:00.290 --> 03:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
03:41:02.330 --> 03:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
Belcher if I may just speak to that real
 
03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
quick I I do understand
 
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
um the the point you're making I I would
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
only further point out that
 
03:41:11.210 --> 03:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
um just just from the point of whether
 
03:41:13.010 --> 03:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
or not we should and can be doing
 
03:41:16.010 --> 03:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
something on this nature
 
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
um if it's something that can be done at
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
the state level at the executive branch
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
um then it's something that we can do
 
03:41:25.610 --> 03:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
also and whether or not a a certain
 
03:41:27.769 --> 03:41:27.779 align:start position:0%
teacher or expert based on social
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
science in the schools would agree with
 
03:41:32.929 --> 03:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
the matter or not
 
03:41:32.939 --> 03:41:33.650 align:start position:0%
the matter or not
um

03:41:33.650 --> 03:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
it may influence our opinion on it but
 
03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't say anything
 
03:41:38.690 --> 03:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
regarding whether or not we have the The
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
discussion Jefferson Cornell
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
I just still I always have a problem
 
03:41:49.010 --> 03:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
with dictating to local districts what
 
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
their curriculum should be and and I I
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
believe in local control for local
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
districts so I I have a hard time
 
03:41:58.190 --> 03:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
telling them how and what they should be
 
03:41:58.200 --> 03:41:59.389 align:start position:0%
telling them how and what they should be
teaching

03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:06.769 --> 03:42:06.779 align:start position:0%
uh could you explain to me a little bit
 
03:42:09.110 --> 03:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
more what you mean by that because I I
 
03:42:10.849 --> 03:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
don't see the word communism in this at
 
03:42:10.859 --> 03:42:12.050 align:start position:0%
don't see the word communism in this at
all

03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
um I only see genocide and Holocaust and
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
such as
 
03:42:18.050 --> 03:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
and that's that's involved this is all
 
03:42:21.769 --> 03:42:21.779 align:start position:0%
in law so the amendment replaces the
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
communism bill is at yes okay so it's
 
03:42:26.450 --> 03:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
not so the only new word is the word
 
03:42:30.290 --> 03:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
class okay thank you you're welcome
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
not yes representative Tanner so
 
03:42:40.250 --> 03:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:42:43.190 --> 03:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
designation local on this one which is
 
03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
usually just an L I think but it wrote
 
03:42:47.929 --> 03:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
it out as local that means that the that
 
03:42:49.729 --> 03:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
they assume that the local is going to
 
03:42:51.530 --> 03:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
have to uh
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
spend some money
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
is that where local is there the the
 
03:42:58.010 --> 03:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
previous that the bill as it's
 
03:43:00.889 --> 03:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
introduced has a requirement that you're
 
03:43:02.889 --> 03:43:02.899 align:start position:0%
going to have one hour of instruction
 
03:43:05.570 --> 03:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay I believe that's where they're
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
coming up with the the local thank you
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
with that torn out of the bill
 
03:43:12.410 --> 03:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe there would be any
 
03:43:13.849 --> 03:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
cost on this
 
03:43:17.690 --> 03:43:17.700 align:start position:0%

that this was um actually uh
 
03:49:17.760 --> 03:49:18.830 align:start position:0%
that this was um actually uh
um

03:49:18.830 --> 03:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:21.849 --> 03:49:21.859 align:start position:0%
a request from the department
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
and help them by eliminating the
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
proration and adding the CPI which I
 
03:49:31.729 --> 03:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
think we probably all favor
 
03:49:34.729 --> 03:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%

03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
of federal programs within the state and
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
I believe tying the cost of inflation is
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
is necessary given what we've seen
 
03:49:57.120 --> 03:49:58.429 align:start position:0%
is necessary given what we've seen
lately

03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
lately
 
03:50:02.269 --> 03:50:02.279 align:start position:0%

03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
a representative cordelli
 
03:52:06.889 --> 03:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
03:52:10.370 --> 03:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that um
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
and worked on with the Department of
 
03:52:15.550 --> 03:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
Education and that
 
03:52:17.650 --> 03:52:17.660 align:start position:0%
over time
 
03:52:20.170 --> 03:52:20.180 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
payments put into statute for various
 
03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:25.729 align:start position:0%
payments put into statute for various
purposes

03:52:25.729 --> 03:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
um including School infrastructure
 
03:52:29.410 --> 03:52:29.420 align:start position:0%
grants Etc
 
03:52:32.450 --> 03:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
to come from the education trust fund
 
03:52:34.969 --> 03:52:34.979 align:start position:0%
but the
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
section of Statute related to the
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund was not updated for
 
03:52:45.969 --> 03:52:45.979 align:start position:0%
those uses so this bill
 
03:52:51.550 --> 03:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
adds those into this statute
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
they are referenced in other places in
 
03:52:55.690 --> 03:52:55.700 align:start position:0%
the rsas
 
03:53:00.769 --> 03:53:00.779 align:start position:0%
in addition it adds one new provision
 
03:53:04.610 --> 03:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
which is the lease Aid which is I think
 
03:53:06.610 --> 03:53:06.620 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars a year
 
03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
that is in the budget so if that does
 
03:53:13.389 --> 03:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
not pass in the budget there will be no
 
03:53:13.399 --> 03:53:15.490 align:start position:0%
not pass in the budget there will be no
impact

03:53:15.490 --> 03:53:15.500 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:53:20.690 --> 03:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
so this is uh really uh anticipating the
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:27.410 --> 03:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I think that's uh pretty much the
 
03:53:27.420 --> 03:53:28.250 align:start position:0%
um I think that's uh pretty much the
bill

03:53:28.250 --> 03:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:53:31.070 --> 03:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
03:53:33.889 --> 03:53:33.899 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
03:53:37.190 --> 03:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know I think this is a serious bill
 
03:53:41.090 --> 03:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh not that all of our bills
 
03:53:43.010 --> 03:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
but this um
 
03:53:46.010 --> 03:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
this deals with the efas and the trust
 
03:53:46.020 --> 03:53:48.170 align:start position:0%
this deals with the efas and the trust
fund

03:53:48.170 --> 03:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:53:48.180 --> 03:53:49.130 align:start position:0%
fund
um

03:53:49.130 --> 03:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:51.410 --> 03:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
when the trust fund when the efas were
 
03:53:51.420 --> 03:53:52.910 align:start position:0%
when the trust fund when the efas were
created

03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:53:55.130 --> 03:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
there was a little conversation about
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
how it was going to be paid
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's clearly way over what was the
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
projected budget
 
03:54:04.610 --> 03:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
there's currently a lawsuit
 
03:54:08.090 --> 03:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
I do not believe this is a housekeeping
 
03:54:10.319 --> 03:54:11.630 align:start position:0%
I do not believe this is a housekeeping
bill

03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
this is a serious bill that will change
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
how it is funded
 
03:54:17.929 --> 03:54:17.939 align:start position:0%
there are several of us who feel that if
 
03:54:19.729 --> 03:54:19.739 align:start position:0%
you're going to have an EFA program that
 
03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
it ought to be dealt with with a special
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
account dealing specifically with efas
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
so that it does not interfere with other
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
funding that comes out of the trust fund
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting against this bill
 
03:54:38.090 --> 03:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
because I think it is goes Way Beyond
 
03:54:40.490 --> 03:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
just uh what the department feels that
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be just a housekeeping
 
03:54:45.050 --> 03:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
Bill and further as I said before
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's currently a legal count a legal
 
03:54:50.090 --> 03:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
challenges to this in fact the
 
03:54:51.530 --> 03:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Education could not
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
respond to it appropriately because of
 
03:54:57.650 --> 03:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
the pending legal case before thank you
 
03:55:01.610 --> 03:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
chair I would just note that um on the
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
basis of legal challenges anybody can
 
03:55:09.769 --> 03:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
work in a lawsuit at any time for any
 
03:55:09.779 --> 03:55:10.969 align:start position:0%
work in a lawsuit at any time for any
reason

03:55:10.969 --> 03:55:10.979 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
um and while we may be restrained by uh
 
03:55:14.689 --> 03:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
Court decisions we are certainly not
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
restrained by pending
 
03:55:20.530 --> 03:55:20.540 align:start position:0%
um Court action on anything that we do
 
03:55:23.330 --> 03:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
03:55:25.490 --> 03:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
responding to representative Belcher the
 
03:55:27.650 --> 03:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
issue is the doe couldn't respond to our
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions because of the lawsuit so
 
03:55:31.849 --> 03:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
we're not informed
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
03:55:33.359 --> 03:55:34.610 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
cordelli

03:55:34.610 --> 03:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh 194 f11 in the education
 
03:55:43.490 --> 03:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts chapter it states the
 
03:55:45.650 --> 03:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
amount necessary to fund any grants or
 
03:55:48.050 --> 03:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
transfers of funds authorized under this
 
03:55:50.570 --> 03:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
chapter is hereby appropriated to the
 
03:55:53.330 --> 03:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
department from the education trust fund
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
created under 198.39
 
03:55:58.929 --> 03:55:58.939 align:start position:0%
we are just adding that to
 
03:56:03.469 --> 03:56:03.479 align:start position:0%
198.39 but the requirement that the
 
03:56:06.650 --> 03:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
education trust fund funds come from the
 
03:56:10.969 --> 03:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
education trust fund are it's already in
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
statute that this is the place for those
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
funds to be taken from
 
03:56:19.010 --> 03:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:56:22.610 --> 03:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you
 
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
if the
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
efas are relegated
 
03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
to come from education trust fund to the
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education why therefore
 
03:56:37.130 --> 03:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't the Department of Education be
 
03:56:39.229 --> 03:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:56:42.530 --> 03:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
giving out those grants
 
03:56:44.809 --> 03:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
if it's set up this way it would seem to
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
me that it's legislating that it is to
 
03:56:49.969 --> 03:56:49.979 align:start position:0%
be dispersed by the Department of
 
03:56:49.979 --> 03:56:53.929 align:start position:0%
be dispersed by the Department of
Education

03:56:53.929 --> 03:56:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's for anybody in the committee
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli
 
03:57:01.689 --> 03:57:01.699 align:start position:0%
um it is uh in statute that
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
disbursements are made by the department
 
03:57:06.290 --> 03:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
but it's also in statute
 
03:57:07.750 --> 03:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
um from
 
03:57:11.769 --> 03:57:11.779 align:start position:0%
one uh the EFA chapter 194
 
03:57:17.210 --> 03:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
F that the process for
 
03:57:17.220 --> 03:57:17.889 align:start position:0%
F that the process for
um

03:57:17.889 --> 03:57:17.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:22.490 --> 03:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
the uh funds transfer
 
03:57:24.650 --> 03:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
03:57:27.170 --> 03:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh initiation from the children's
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund as the current
 
03:57:32.570 --> 03:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
Management program
 
03:57:37.010 --> 03:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
um so I don't see the
 
03:57:39.410 --> 03:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
um the tie between
 
03:57:40.750 --> 03:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
um any
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
challenge to the Department of Education
 
03:57:47.090 --> 03:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
Distributing the funds that's the way it
 
03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
is established in law currently
 
03:57:54.170 --> 03:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Luna
 
03:57:57.290 --> 03:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so if this
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
were to pass wouldn't we then have a
 
03:58:02.210 --> 03:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
situation particularly with the um with
 
03:58:05.290 --> 03:58:05.300 align:start position:0%
the voucher program with the with the
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
education a freedom account program that
 
03:58:12.769 --> 03:58:12.779 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
03:58:15.170 --> 03:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
where some of those payments are going
 
03:58:19.090 --> 03:58:19.100 align:start position:0%
like Amazon and to
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
religious schools that that they
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
certainly have administrative costs so
 
03:58:27.650 --> 03:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's that that comes out and then on
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
top of that the
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
03:58:33.130 --> 03:58:33.140 align:start position:0%
contractor who administers the program
 
03:58:37.610 --> 03:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
takes another 10 so now we're at sort of
 
03:58:41.450 --> 03:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 percent at the at the profit
 
03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
level School administration level
 
03:58:47.090 --> 03:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
another 10 percent at the um the
 
03:58:49.130 --> 03:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
contractor the education Freedom account
 
03:58:52.969 --> 03:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
contractor level and now this adds one
 
03:58:56.150 --> 03:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
percent to the to the Department of
 
03:58:59.150 --> 03:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
Education so that's another 11 million
 
03:58:59.160 --> 03:59:00.290 align:start position:0%
Education so that's another 11 million
dollars

03:59:00.290 --> 03:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:59:04.130 --> 03:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
um so uh so now now at least as far as
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
the sort of Education Freedom accounts
 
03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
are concerned
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
um you've got what what looks to be
 
03:59:14.570 --> 03:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
coming to about 30 percent of those
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
funds being used to um to administer the
 
03:59:19.729 --> 03:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
program isn't this sort of really sloppy
 
03:59:19.739 --> 03:59:25.729 align:start position:0%
program isn't this sort of really sloppy
management

03:59:25.729 --> 03:59:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
did anybody gonna respond
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
love to hear from the Department
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:44.330 --> 03:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
the total amount last year was 9.8
 
03:59:44.340 --> 03:59:45.590 align:start position:0%
the total amount last year was 9.8
percent

03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:59:47.090 --> 03:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know where you get all these
 
03:59:49.490 --> 03:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
numbers from and how you
 
03:59:52.250 --> 03:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
pull them up and come up with these 10
 
03:59:54.170 --> 03:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
millions and all these other Millions
 
03:59:56.689 --> 03:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
just like the 9 millions that you kept
 
03:59:59.210 --> 03:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
repeating I have no idea how 9 million
 
04:00:04.250 --> 04:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
is 10 of next year's budget so I don't
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
know where all this is coming from but
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
9.8 percent was the total cost of the
 
04:00:12.050 --> 04:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
program last term it should be even less
 
04:00:14.689 --> 04:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
coming up because some of that startup
 
04:00:19.450 --> 04:00:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:23.689 --> 04:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
represent Myler well just to respond to
 
04:00:26.530 --> 04:00:26.540 align:start position:0%
representative link is you know if it's
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
9.8 percent
 
04:00:33.530 --> 04:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's pretty close to 10 percent
 
04:00:36.170 --> 04:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to round up
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I think and I think as we've talked
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
about this program for a couple of years
 
04:00:41.040 --> 04:00:41.929 align:start position:0%
about this program for a couple of years
now

04:00:41.929 --> 04:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
even representatives from the children's
 
04:00:48.590 --> 04:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has indicated it's a 10
 
04:00:48.600 --> 04:00:50.090 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has indicated it's a 10
so

04:00:50.090 --> 04:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:52.969 --> 04:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
I'll give you the credit of 0.2 percent
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:04.729 --> 04:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
you keep arguing that the education
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
money that's in the trust fund should go
 
04:01:11.090 --> 04:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
to public schools and to cost to
 
04:01:13.490 --> 04:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
administer the public schools on average
 
04:01:15.650 --> 04:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
is 10 percent
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:22.490 --> 04:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
just to go off of the the numbers
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
assuming that they're that they're
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
roughly correct what we're talking about
 
04:01:32.450 --> 04:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
is a scholarship program ultimately that
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
is a is a bureaucratic leader that
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
administers funds so students can have
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
education choice they can go where they
 
04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
want where their families want them to
 
04:01:43.610 --> 04:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
go now
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
I hear the argument that we're doubling
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy because we have bureaucracy
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
at the level of the school possibly
 
04:01:52.610 --> 04:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
unless they're homeschooling and we have
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy at the level of the
 
04:01:56.570 --> 04:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
scholarship program the trouble is I
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't hear any argument that actually
 
04:02:01.490 --> 04:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
takes away that second layer of
 
04:02:03.170 --> 04:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy because if we did move this
 
04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
program to the Department of Education
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
all we're really doing is eliminating a
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
private scholarship fund that is
 
04:02:10.849 --> 04:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
currently administering it at a rate
 
04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
that appears competitive from everything
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
that I've seen to a government
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy that we don't know because
 
04:02:18.170 --> 04:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
we weren't provided with the numbers
 
04:02:19.729 --> 04:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
what it's going to look like to run it
 
04:02:23.530 --> 04:02:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I just I I think
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
maybe we're straying a little bit from
 
04:02:35.469 --> 04:02:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about the one percent
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the total fund here representative
 
04:02:41.399 --> 04:02:43.070 align:start position:0%
of the total fund here representative
cascadden

04:02:43.070 --> 04:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
cascadden
 
04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
I agree with uh representative Heath on
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
on the running of the program and
 
04:02:50.570 --> 04:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
providing doe one percent if they're not
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
going to run the program but the bottom
 
04:02:54.410 --> 04:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
line on all of this right now with the
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
04:02:59.689 --> 04:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
comes from our local property taxpayers
 
04:03:02.990 --> 04:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
and so I do can't agree
 
04:03:05.469 --> 04:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
on a poor community
 
04:03:08.030 --> 04:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
providing additional funds for
 
04:03:08.040 --> 04:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
providing additional funds for
management

04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
management
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
just can't
 
04:03:16.610 --> 04:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:19.070 --> 04:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
notice there are a whole lot of programs
 
04:03:22.090 --> 04:03:22.100 align:start position:0%
through the years that have been added
 
04:03:25.090 --> 04:03:25.100 align:start position:0%
kindergarten grants to municipalities
 
04:03:27.889 --> 04:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
all kinds of
 
04:03:27.899 --> 04:03:28.969 align:start position:0%
all kinds of
um

04:03:28.969 --> 04:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income homeowners
 
04:03:34.610 --> 04:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
property tax relief it's a huge number
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
of programs that we have added since the
 
04:03:39.950 --> 04:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund was first put into
 
04:03:43.490 --> 04:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
place and so all of those programs
 
04:03:45.070 --> 04:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
end up
 
04:03:48.650 --> 04:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
taking a lot of time and effort from at
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
the doe and so they're not asking for
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
that one percent for the efas they're
 
04:03:56.809 --> 04:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
asking for that one percent to run all
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
of these and it's a huge list of
 
04:04:03.170 --> 04:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
programs that we have passed and so no
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislature can hold a future
 
04:04:04.800 --> 04:04:08.389 align:start position:0%
legislature can hold a future
legislature

04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:08.399 --> 04:04:09.889 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:04:09.889 --> 04:04:09.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know to what they've decided and
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so the beginning when the education
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
trust fund was set up it was just for
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
that very narrow bit but since then year
 
04:04:27.170 --> 04:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
after year term after term the
 
04:04:30.530 --> 04:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
legislature has added all these other
 
04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
programs so to pick one program out and
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
say oh we can't add to it well what
 
04:04:38.330 --> 04:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
about all these other programs we've
 
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
added all these years it's it's so we've
 
04:04:43.610 --> 04:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
already shown that yes we're willing to
 
04:04:45.769 --> 04:04:45.779 align:start position:0%
take money out of the education trust
 
04:04:47.929 --> 04:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
fund for all kinds of things because
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:55.250 --> 04:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr gier
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education goes through
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
a budget process just like every other
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
agency in the state they bring forward
 
04:05:08.929 --> 04:05:08.939 align:start position:0%
their the needs that they have
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
um the number of employees that they
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
need to have for whatever purpose they
 
04:05:13.680 --> 04:05:14.570 align:start position:0%
need to have for whatever purpose they
need

04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
I would think that if they want one
 
04:05:20.570 --> 04:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
percent of the education trust fund
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
for management purposes that should be a
 
04:05:26.090 --> 04:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
conversation that would come up
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
during the financial conversation around
 
04:05:31.370 --> 04:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
I just this
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
I have not seen this before
 
04:05:38.889 --> 04:05:38.899 align:start position:0%
during the budget process that an agency
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
would charge
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
a percentage for
 
04:05:46.670 --> 04:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
administering a program for which
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually they're getting paid to
 
04:05:48.000 --> 04:05:49.429 align:start position:0%
actually they're getting paid to
administer

04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
administer
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further discussion
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%

a motion
 
04:07:07.370 --> 04:07:07.380 align:start position:0%

04:07:13.080 --> 04:07:15.889 align:start position:0%
is there a second represent Belcher
discussion

04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:20.050 --> 04:07:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:23.330 --> 04:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead thank you all right if we
 
04:07:28.130 --> 04:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
retain this bill the the uh fill text is
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
not going to change correct
 
04:07:32.450 --> 04:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
so the paying of the EFA out of that and
 
04:07:35.809 --> 04:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
the the one percent to the to the uh doe
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
to do the programs they're already
 
04:07:39.290 --> 04:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
getting money to do anyhow
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering there's no in
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of retaining a bill
 
04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
is it like a study that we can bring
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
back a new text just my clarification I
 
04:07:48.650 --> 04:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
was going to just come back again to be
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
rediscussed yes there is I think there
 
04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
is uh the last sentence in this bill is
 
04:07:54.170 --> 04:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
the one that I've heard the most
 
04:07:57.410 --> 04:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding correct and with
 
04:07:57.420 --> 04:07:58.429 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding correct and with
that

04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
um there are the other components up
 
04:08:02.210 --> 04:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
there which that's where we are getting
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations out of that trust
 
04:08:06.650 --> 04:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
fund to fund those areas correct I think
 
04:08:09.290 --> 04:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
that's commonly understood
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
um however the one percent to me
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
um that that's a lot of money
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
and and uh so maybe there is room force
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I think there should be some room
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
for this to be retained and for us to
 
04:08:23.809 --> 04:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
have future discussions with the
 
04:08:26.570 --> 04:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
Department as why what generated this
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
request for one percent I myself am
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.969 --> 04:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
I also wonder if this procedurally
 
04:08:41.689 --> 04:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
procedurally if if we allow a doe to add
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
one percent extra into their budget
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
after the budget process what about fish
 
04:08:48.650 --> 04:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
and game what about conservation what
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
about all the other departments now will
 
04:08:52.910 --> 04:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
you circumvent it and add in a bill a
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
one percent for us to keep an EXO I
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a really bad precedent I
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
think something's inside pretty bad as
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
well but I think that's a really bad
 
04:09:00.359 --> 04:09:01.849 align:start position:0%
well but I think that's a really bad
precedent

04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
precedent
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is where I think the
 
04:09:06.050 --> 04:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
by retaining and working with the
 
04:09:07.370 --> 04:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
Department we can find some of the
 
04:09:08.650 --> 04:09:08.660 align:start position:0%
questions out
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
answers for why this is in this bill
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
we've had so many bills come at us so
 
04:09:16.490 --> 04:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
fast we have not had the time to really
 
04:09:17.929 --> 04:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
um address
 
04:09:19.800 --> 04:09:20.570 align:start position:0%
um address
um

04:09:20.570 --> 04:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:23.389 --> 04:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
bills thoroughly the way we have in the
 
04:09:26.090 --> 04:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
past or tried to in the past last year I
 
04:09:29.530 --> 04:09:29.540 align:start position:0%
know we had 139 bills but yes
 
04:09:34.010 --> 04:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
so this bill is IPL versus retained that
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
the dialogue the issue of discontent
 
04:09:37.309 --> 04:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
would not be need to be addressed is
 
04:09:40.150 --> 04:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:42.530 --> 04:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that I don't know what
 
04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
the one percent may be used for or you
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
know I mean just the bill but the bill
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
is IPL the whole thing is off the table
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
that that is correct thank you
 
04:09:54.110 --> 04:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you um if
 
04:09:56.090 --> 04:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education wanted this
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
one percent they could have come to the
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
hearing and explained to us why they
 
04:10:02.450 --> 04:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
needed the one percent to go through
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than it going through
 
04:10:06.769 --> 04:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
the budget process like every other
 
04:10:08.210 --> 04:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
department just because I don't think
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
repeat any other department puts money
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
into bills asking for money so if the
 
04:10:17.150 --> 04:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
department had really wanted this and
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
they could have come and explained to us
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
what that one percent was going to pay
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
for I've just been informed that Caitlyn
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
was here she did not explain that she
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
she said she couldn't talk about she was
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
here so I want to make that clear that
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
she was here but they were but they
 
04:10:37.130 --> 04:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
wouldn't talk about it no no
 
04:10:40.870 --> 04:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about the EFA right
 
04:10:43.370 --> 04:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
I don't recall hearing the question
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
about that one percent right but my
 
04:10:47.929 --> 04:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
point was if they wanted if they asked
 
04:10:50.809 --> 04:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
for this bill and they did the the
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
amount and they wanted that one percent
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
I I think it's upon them to explain to
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
us why they need the one percent here
 
04:11:03.290 --> 04:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.300 --> 04:11:05.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:11:07.849 --> 04:11:07.859 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent luno so
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks very much Mr chair and and
 
04:11:12.349 --> 04:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a question but also a
 
04:11:12.359 --> 04:11:13.490 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a question but also a
comment

04:11:13.490 --> 04:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
um uh just to make sure that history
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't repeat itself but um if this
 
04:11:21.290 --> 04:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
bill were retained it could then be um
 
04:11:24.170 --> 04:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
be inserted into the budget
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
um as other bills uh that were retained
 
04:11:28.969 --> 04:11:28.979 align:start position:0%
like House Bill 20 which established the
 
04:11:30.889 --> 04:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
voucher program was jammed into the
 
04:11:35.330 --> 04:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
budget so um so uh so I I think
 
04:11:37.849 --> 04:11:37.859 align:start position:0%
um you know cautionary tale for people
 
04:11:40.969 --> 04:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
who don't want things just jammed into
 
04:11:42.530 --> 04:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
the budget that did not receive an
 
04:11:45.469 --> 04:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote a dispositive vote of
 
04:11:48.769 --> 04:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
of itl would in fact prevent this from
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
getting jammed into the um well I
 
04:11:53.530 --> 04:11:53.540 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say that it would certainly
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
discourage it from being jammed into the
 
04:11:59.090 --> 04:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
budget but but retaining it um Anything
 
04:12:01.330 --> 04:12:01.340 align:start position:0%
Could Happen you use the same word again
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh jammed
 
04:12:03.960 --> 04:12:05.389 align:start position:0%
uh jammed
um

04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
the jamming something into the budget I
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
think that the there's another
 
04:12:14.090 --> 04:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
part of the legislative process that's
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
more characteristic of xenia's Omnibus
 
04:12:20.150 --> 04:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
bills and creating
 
04:12:22.910 --> 04:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 with all kinds of policy that maybe
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the walls here you
 
04:12:27.889 --> 04:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
know so
 
04:12:32.689 --> 04:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
um it you don't have to so but that's
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
exactly right I think we've all tried
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
say no more but it keeps going on
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
so at any rate it's just because uh you
 
04:12:43.849 --> 04:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
know you may itl doesn't mean you're not
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
going to see that again this year uh you
 
04:12:48.969 --> 04:12:48.979 align:start position:0%
may you know from a different angle
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um are we sure that the department did
 
04:12:55.610 --> 04:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
not include that one percent in the
 
04:12:55.620 --> 04:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
not include that one percent in the
budget

04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%

and I'll be quick with this because
 
04:17:35.929 --> 04:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
we've we've talked about this uh several
 
04:17:39.170 --> 04:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
times earlier uh in during the uh
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
hearing process uh this bill deals with
 
04:17:45.769 --> 04:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula the components of
 
04:17:47.630 --> 04:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid in those four
 
04:17:49.849 --> 04:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
categories this being one
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
one of the recommendations that's come
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
out of the various uh recent two studies
 
04:17:58.969 --> 04:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
of Education being the commission study
 
04:18:02.689 --> 04:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
a year ago if time serves me right maybe
 
04:18:04.450 --> 04:18:04.460 align:start position:0%
it's a year and a half ago
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then out of the task force which met
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
04:18:13.370 --> 04:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
the recommendation was that the the
 
04:18:15.889 --> 04:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
costs of looking at
 
04:18:18.110 --> 04:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
um a special education support through
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid We're funding all
 
04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
students to have an IEP at the same rate
 
04:18:25.969 --> 04:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
now knowing that there are certain
 
04:18:30.170 --> 04:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
categories of IEPs which require a lot
 
04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
more service time and expense associated
 
04:18:37.090 --> 04:18:37.100 align:start position:0%
with it this bill addresses the uh
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
costing out of the IEP differentiated
 
04:18:42.530 --> 04:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
aid for special education and a weighted
 
04:18:44.929 --> 04:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
value format with three categories
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
category a category B and category C
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
category a is approximately
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
um uh it talks about funding at the
 
04:18:56.410 --> 04:18:56.420 align:start position:0%
current level of
 
04:18:56.420 --> 04:18:58.030 align:start position:0%
current level of
2079.89

04:18:58.030 --> 04:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
2079.89
 
04:19:01.210 --> 04:19:01.220 align:start position:0%
category B
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
4729.78 and category C uh six thousand
 
04:19:07.130 --> 04:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
two hundred thirty nine dollars and
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
sixty seven cents
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
this is based upon reports that are
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
available uh that the department does
 
04:19:18.889 --> 04:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
collect they collect reports identifying
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
those students which require more than
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the time those are less
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
that and those which are in hospital
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
placements or residential placements of
 
04:19:30.650 --> 04:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
course that is category C we found out
 
04:19:32.929 --> 04:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
through testimony that the initial
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
request for categories a b and c was
 
04:19:38.090 --> 04:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
estimated at seventy three thousand
 
04:19:39.729 --> 04:19:39.739 align:start position:0%
seventy three million
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
73.4 million according to what we've
 
04:19:45.290 --> 04:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
received from the Department the actual
 
04:19:48.889 --> 04:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
cost would be 83.7 million and the
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
number of students participating in that
 
04:19:53.150 --> 04:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
program category a the bulk of our IEP
 
04:19:55.610 --> 04:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
students is 23 000 kids
 
04:19:58.130 --> 04:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
in category B approximately nine percent
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
or seven seven thousand and in the
 
04:20:05.809 --> 04:20:05.819 align:start position:0%
category C 600 kids so it does um put
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
more funds into the area differentiated
 
04:20:11.090 --> 04:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
Aid and this has been requested and
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
needed for years and I believe it's time
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
04:20:17.689 --> 04:20:17.699 align:start position:0%

04:23:58.729 --> 04:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
and 14 of the third section
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:24:14.090 --> 04:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
the shall provide the applicants the
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
option to participate in the direct
 
04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
certification program
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
the program itself Medicaid is uh opt-in
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'll get to another reason in a
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
moment uh secondly the information that
 
04:24:32.090 --> 04:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
will be used
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
for matching between Department of
 
04:24:37.729 --> 04:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
Education and Department of Health and
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
Human Services I believe should be
 
04:24:44.769 --> 04:24:44.779 align:start position:0%
identified and made available to the
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
person registering when they are
 
04:24:52.250 --> 04:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
deciding whether to opt in or not
 
04:24:52.260 --> 04:24:53.570 align:start position:0%
deciding whether to opt in or not
the

04:24:53.570 --> 04:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:57.309 --> 04:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
bottom section section four
 
04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
I think it's important
 
04:25:02.090 --> 04:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners of both
 
04:25:02.100 --> 04:25:04.090 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners of both
departments

04:25:04.090 --> 04:25:04.100 align:start position:0%
departments
 
04:25:04.100 --> 04:25:05.870 align:start position:0%
departments
certify

04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
certify
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
that the process complies with all
 
04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:18.110 --> 04:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
and copies made available as as outlined
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
but I think it's
 
04:25:24.790 --> 04:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot program I think it's
 
04:25:29.530 --> 04:25:29.540 align:start position:0%
wise to put this requirement into law
 
04:25:33.290 --> 04:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
and I think there is a section in our
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
state law that needs to be looked at in
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
this regard
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
and that in um 189 65 which is the
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
student and teacher information
 
04:25:48.410 --> 04:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
protection and privacy statute
 
04:25:52.130 --> 04:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
it defines disclosure as permitting
 
04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
access to revealing releasing
 
04:25:56.050 --> 04:25:56.060 align:start position:0%
transferring or otherwise communicating
 
04:25:59.750 --> 04:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
04:26:02.290 --> 04:26:02.300 align:start position:0%
in from the Student Records
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
the next section 66
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 says that the department and
 
04:26:14.030 --> 04:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
each local agency agency shall make
 
04:26:17.389 --> 04:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
publicly available parents rights
 
04:26:17.399 --> 04:26:19.130 align:start position:0%
publicly available parents rights
Etc

04:26:19.130 --> 04:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
um an applicable state law including
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
number c says the right to provide
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
written consent before school discloses
 
04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information from
 
04:26:33.290 --> 04:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
the Student Records
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
provided in applicable state and federal
 
04:26:40.130 --> 04:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
law so I think that it would be wise to
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
have someone look at these sections of
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
Law and make sure that the process that
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
we would be following as part of hb601
 
04:26:52.929 --> 04:26:52.939 align:start position:0%
in the direct certification program
 
04:26:56.689 --> 04:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
comply with those sections of state law
 
04:26:59.330 --> 04:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
and the federal computer matching
 
04:27:03.969 --> 04:27:03.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.370 --> 04:27:06.380 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I just said
 
04:27:13.370 --> 04:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
um being the sponsor of this bill along
 
04:27:16.250 --> 04:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
with representative luno I just a little
 
04:27:18.649 --> 04:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
bit concerned about prior to the stat of
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
a pilot direct certification program
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
39 currently 39 states are in fact doing
 
04:27:29.330 --> 04:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
the direct certification and there's a
 
04:27:32.450 --> 04:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
strong possibility that this will become
 
04:27:34.389 --> 04:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
national course of action
 
04:27:39.070 --> 04:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
um from the Department of Agriculture
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
with this my it's really a question
 
04:27:44.929 --> 04:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
would this inhibit that if that were to
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
be the case
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
because it would no longer be a pilot
 
04:27:54.410 --> 04:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
I could yes go ahead
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the first part of the
 
04:28:01.389 --> 04:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
bill states that the department
 
04:28:04.250 --> 04:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
departments shall seek
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
um participation in the pilot program so
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how this would prohibit
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
anything and it's sometimes um
 
04:28:16.849 --> 04:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
mysterious how pilot programs just go on
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
and on and on forever
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
so I think it's wise to uh put this in
 
04:28:28.370 --> 04:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden
 
04:28:33.170 --> 04:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you just a question it would be
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
ideal if this committee made a decision
 
04:28:38.330 --> 04:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
on the best interest of kids and not
 
04:28:38.340 --> 04:28:40.849 align:start position:0%
on the best interest of kids and not
adults

04:28:40.849 --> 04:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.530 --> 04:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
04:28:44.689 --> 04:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair actually
 
04:28:48.110 --> 04:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I agree with what um with what
 
04:28:50.450 --> 04:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden just suggested
 
04:28:53.330 --> 04:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
but actually a bill
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
like House Bill 601 is introduced
 
04:28:58.969 --> 04:28:58.979 align:start position:0%
um is in the best interest of both kids
 
04:29:01.849 --> 04:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
and adults and and you know pretty
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
simple explanation why I think as far as
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
members of the education committee go
 
04:29:10.670 --> 04:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
but um you know our basically our our
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
roles of students that participate in
 
04:29:18.769 --> 04:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
the USDA free and reduced price meals
 
04:29:22.370 --> 04:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
program not only helps those students
 
04:29:25.729 --> 04:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
and their parents their families
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
um have uh have have their students get
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price meals but it also
 
04:29:33.050 --> 04:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
helps the taxpayers in those communities
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
because they get additional funding from
 
04:29:37.130 --> 04:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
um for um uh uh you know for the
 
04:29:43.130 --> 04:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
percentages of um of students who are
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
eligible students not our eligible to
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
participate in the free and reduced
 
04:29:50.570 --> 04:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
price meal uh program so that helps
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
everybody in New Hampshire helps all of
 
04:29:55.130 --> 04:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
our Tech taxpayers helps all of our
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
students and to the extent the amendment
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
is really seeking to to significantly
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
restrict that I think flies in the face
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
of um of of you know the the the you
 
04:30:12.290 --> 04:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing in our adequacy
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
funding formula to provide
 
04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
um some Equitable funding for school
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
districts that that uh that have higher
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
incidences of instances of poverty in
 
04:30:25.610 --> 04:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
those communities as sort of predicted
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
or represented by uh by a student a
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
number of students or the percentage of
 
04:30:32.689 --> 04:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
students who participate in the free and
 
04:30:36.889 --> 04:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch program
 
04:30:36.899 --> 04:30:37.790 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch program
um

04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:37.800 --> 04:30:40.929 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:30:40.929 --> 04:30:40.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know and it and it's sort of it it
 
04:30:46.729 --> 04:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
occurs to me that the um that the
 
04:30:46.739 --> 04:30:47.929 align:start position:0%
occurs to me that the um that the
amendment

04:30:47.929 --> 04:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and all of the additional conditions
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
that uh that it imposes really flies in
 
04:30:58.010 --> 04:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
direct contradiction to I think a bipart
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
very strongly bipartisan letter that was
 
04:31:03.290 --> 04:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
sent uh from our state senate to the
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
governor's office essentially pleading
 
04:31:07.250 --> 04:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
with him pleading with the governor
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
let's participate in this program let's
 
04:31:13.490 --> 04:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
get on this because it's important for
 
04:31:15.530 --> 04:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
our kids and it's important for our
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayers across the state and and you
 
04:31:21.530 --> 04:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
know as we you know as we're looking at
 
04:31:23.330 --> 04:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
this and and that's what the that's
 
04:31:25.849 --> 04:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
essentially what the bill has has
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
introduced does
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
um the amendment I think really
 
04:31:34.250 --> 04:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
eviscerates that and um and you know and
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I hope this committee
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
will um will will find its way to vote
 
04:31:45.769 --> 04:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
down the amendment vote up on the bill
 
04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
and do what the governor asked us to do
 
04:31:49.199 --> 04:31:52.010 align:start position:0%
and do what the governor asked us to do
last

04:31:52.010 --> 04:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:31:55.010 --> 04:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
spring or fall whenever whenever we did
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
it which is to get me a bill that's uh
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
that that directs us directs his
 
04:32:03.530 --> 04:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
Department the governor's Department of
 
04:32:06.530 --> 04:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
Education to participate in the Medicaid
 
04:32:08.570 --> 04:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
direct certification program and that's
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
all that's just what the bill does so
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping this committee will will find
 
04:32:16.250 --> 04:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
itself in a position to vote no on the
 
04:32:18.649 --> 04:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
amendment and yes on the bill
 
04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
I have a race number of responses to
 
04:32:28.490 --> 04:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
that but that's the bill as opposed to
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment should I wait
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about the amendment
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
right now please wait
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
where the representative some DHHS and
 
04:32:43.729 --> 04:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education were here we
 
04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
asked them
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
um about the sharing of info and they
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
said they would ask people if they
 
04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
wanted their info shared with the
 
04:32:52.729 --> 04:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and they would
 
04:32:55.490 --> 04:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
only share it if they said yes so I
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any question of any
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
information being shared without people
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
being asked if they do want that
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
information shared and they've said it's
 
04:33:06.529 --> 04:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
already been very successful with that
 
04:33:08.570 --> 04:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
information with SNAP and TANF and there
 
04:33:10.490 --> 04:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
haven't been problems so I think we're
 
04:33:12.410 --> 04:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
just this amendment just adds
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary steps to something that's
 
04:33:17.689 --> 04:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
already working and that the people from
 
04:33:20.090 --> 04:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
the Departments have told us they can do
 
04:33:23.890 --> 04:33:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:26.769 --> 04:33:26.779 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
04:33:30.109 --> 04:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to remark
 
04:33:32.929 --> 04:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
um I I totally did owe everything Patty
 
04:33:32.939 --> 04:33:33.910 align:start position:0%
um I I totally did owe everything Patty
said

04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
but in section two where it says such
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
information shall be limited to the
 
04:33:41.570 --> 04:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
student's full name date of birth gender
 
04:33:44.090 --> 04:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
and residence
 
04:33:46.849 --> 04:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
um are we sure that those are the only
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
things that the that these two agencies
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
need to exchange
 
04:33:54.051 --> 04:33:54.061 align:start position:0%
um and I'm
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know it doesn't even have like
 
04:33:57.890 --> 04:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
parents names in there
 
04:34:00.289 --> 04:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
um so it seems to me we should find out
 
04:34:02.929 --> 04:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
from HHS and from doe what information
 
04:34:05.330 --> 04:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
they really need rather than limiting
 
04:34:08.689 --> 04:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
them right now before we even uh get the
 
04:34:10.609 --> 04:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
program underway
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Myler
 
04:34:16.131 --> 04:34:16.141 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair I've got a
 
04:34:18.529 --> 04:34:18.539 align:start position:0%
question here on line 14 of the
 
04:34:18.539 --> 04:34:19.730 align:start position:0%
question here on line 14 of the
amendment

04:34:19.730 --> 04:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
the SEC to elect to participant in the
 
04:34:25.490 --> 04:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
direct certification program
 
04:34:27.890 --> 04:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
my notes indicate that there needed to
 
04:34:30.529 --> 04:34:30.539 align:start position:0%
be an amendment for them to opt out
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:38.330 --> 04:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
I mean my sense is is that if you go
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
through the forms Etc you're already in
 
04:34:44.449 --> 04:34:44.459 align:start position:0%
so why would I have to elect to be in
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
if I've initiated participation in it so
 
04:34:51.289 --> 04:34:51.299 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm confused on the issue of the
 
04:34:54.170 --> 04:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
participate to elect to participate in
 
04:34:57.230 --> 04:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
the direct certification vis-a-vis but
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
my notes say here that there needed to
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
be amendment to opt out
 
04:35:05.230 --> 04:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
and somebody clarify that for me please
 
04:35:08.090 --> 04:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that
 
04:35:08.100 --> 04:35:08.750 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that
um

04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
there was discussion of opting out of
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
the program
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that there would be
 
04:35:17.631 --> 04:35:17.641 align:start position:0%
um something along the lines of a check
 
04:35:21.410 --> 04:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
box or a drop down to either say I want
 
04:35:23.150 --> 04:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
to participate or I don't want to
 
04:35:23.160 --> 04:35:24.769 align:start position:0%
to participate or I don't want to
participate

04:35:24.769 --> 04:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
participate
 
04:35:26.929 --> 04:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
um basically the amendment says that
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.529 --> 04:35:32.539 align:start position:0%
consciously say yes I do want to
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
participate they're not going to
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
automatically be part of the program if
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
they don't check a box or something they
 
04:35:42.769 --> 04:35:42.779 align:start position:0%
have to check the box and said yeah put
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%

woodcock
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
video channel LED um
 
04:35:54.769 --> 04:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
my concern is this
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment is a handicapped
 
04:36:01.730 --> 04:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
providing an additional set of meals to
 
04:36:04.010 --> 04:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
youngsters they told us that right now
 
04:36:07.849 --> 04:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
there are 38 000 youngsters in schools
 
04:36:11.209 --> 04:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
receiving pre-induced lunches that would
 
04:36:14.269 --> 04:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
expand to 46
 
04:36:16.849 --> 04:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
000 additional youngsters if we use
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
direct certification not not any other
 
04:36:22.131 --> 04:36:22.141 align:start position:0%
type of information at all the data was
 
04:36:24.289 --> 04:36:24.299 align:start position:0%
safe the author was there all this is
 
04:36:27.890 --> 04:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
saying listen we know we have 8 000 kids
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
as parents for some reason are not able
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
to success access the program this is
 
04:36:36.051 --> 04:36:36.061 align:start position:0%
providing opportunity to see kids for
 
04:36:38.510 --> 04:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
doing nothing additional hard work it's
 
04:36:42.109 --> 04:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
a data safe doe says status say DHA set
 
04:36:44.029 --> 04:36:44.039 align:start position:0%
a status safe and all we're going to do
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
is capture those kids that are missing
 
04:36:49.369 --> 04:36:49.379 align:start position:0%
now this is pretty simple
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:36:54.849 --> 04:36:54.859 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli I've seen many
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
companies Home Depot Banks Etc that said
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
at data safe but then we hear reports
 
04:37:04.369 --> 04:37:04.379 align:start position:0%
about data breaches and all sorts of
 
04:37:05.929 --> 04:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
things so
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
um uh I also point out that we have a
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
number half dozen
 
04:37:16.369 --> 04:37:16.379 align:start position:0%
statutes in our law specifically related
 
04:37:19.609 --> 04:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
to students privacy and teacher privacy
 
04:37:22.250 --> 04:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
of information it's it's an important
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
area as well as federal law uh FERPA
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
which says
 
04:37:30.890 --> 04:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
FERPA allows schools to disclose those
 
04:37:33.289 --> 04:37:33.299 align:start position:0%
records without consent to the following
 
04:37:35.689 --> 04:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
parties under following conditions I'm
 
04:37:38.209 --> 04:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
not sure that this is one of those nine
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
or ten conditions that's why I think
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's important to have someone say yes
 
04:37:46.131 --> 04:37:46.141 align:start position:0%
we've looked at this and this is fine in
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
relation to state and federal law I
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a safeguard for us and for
 
04:37:54.349 --> 04:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
everyone participating in the program
 
04:37:57.650 --> 04:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Damon
 
04:37:59.869 --> 04:37:59.879 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair two things
 
04:38:02.929 --> 04:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
it seems improbable to me that 39 states
 
04:38:04.730 --> 04:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
that are already implementing this
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
program are violating FERPA and nobody's
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
noticed so clearly it can be done
 
04:38:12.650 --> 04:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
independent of that on the New Hampshire
 
04:38:14.810 --> 04:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions fact sheet presented at
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
I noted that state administrative costs
 
04:38:18.420 --> 04:38:20.330 align:start position:0%
I noted that state administrative costs
decreased

04:38:20.330 --> 04:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
after the pilot project to less than one
 
04:38:25.490 --> 04:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
cent per student in 80 of those States
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
this program costs nothing essentially
 
04:38:31.490 --> 04:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
to feed children and improve education
 
04:38:33.650 --> 04:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
funding I don't know what we're waiting
 
04:38:33.660 --> 04:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
funding I don't know what we're waiting
for

04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%

front of us ought to pass on 601
 
04:41:02.208 --> 04:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
put that Amendment aside
 
04:41:05.570 --> 04:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I will speak a little bit to this
 
04:41:05.580 --> 04:41:06.590 align:start position:0%
and I will speak a little bit to this
bill

04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:41:06.600 --> 04:41:07.490 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:41:07.490 --> 04:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor on this bill and I
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely support direct Medicaid and I
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
will vote in favor of the bill as it is
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
right now we have worked with HHS and we
 
04:41:20.570 --> 04:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
have worked with Des we've had Mr
 
04:41:23.690 --> 04:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
lippman in here we've had uh doe in here
 
04:41:25.970 --> 04:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
and we've heard how we had to have a
 
04:41:28.610 --> 04:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
workaround in terms of permission from
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
the parent to have their Medicaid
 
04:41:35.288 --> 04:41:35.298 align:start position:0%
Eligibility used to assist us in the
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
national food service program the meal
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
program and then simply a check off for
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
a pull down box however they want to set
 
04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
that up but there is agreement between
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
HHS and and doe that that will occur
 
04:41:51.890 --> 04:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
that that we've heard
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
we have also a number of students and
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about these students
 
04:41:57.770 --> 04:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:42:00.410 --> 04:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
in the high school we are losing out on
 
04:42:00.420 --> 04:42:01.550 align:start position:0%
in the high school we are losing out on
count

04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
count
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
and due to that we are losing out on
 
04:42:05.280 --> 04:42:06.530 align:start position:0%
and due to that we are losing out on
funding

04:42:06.530 --> 04:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
and we also are having students which
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
are just you know nutritionally you know
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
there's nutritionists here so I'm not
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to get in that domain I I love ice
 
04:42:15.840 --> 04:42:17.150 align:start position:0%
going to get in that domain I I love ice
cream

04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
cream
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
um okay so but at any rate there this is
 
04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
a program I feel that it's a it's a
 
04:42:25.250 --> 04:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
workaround which we've been able to
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
resolve in previous years we hadn't
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
gotten there this is the same bill that
 
04:42:35.330 --> 04:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh came out of this joint subcommittee
 
04:42:40.010 --> 04:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
which we had was it last year last year
 
04:42:42.890 --> 04:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
of which we recognized
 
04:42:46.128 --> 04:42:46.138 align:start position:0%
and we move forward and we even passed
 
04:42:47.448 --> 04:42:47.458 align:start position:0%
the darn bill
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
but then there's all this acrimony after
 
04:42:49.560 --> 04:42:50.930 align:start position:0%
but then there's all this acrimony after
that

04:42:50.930 --> 04:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:54.288 --> 04:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
um and I I feel at this point in time if
 
04:42:56.330 --> 04:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
you look at those 39 states are involved
 
04:42:58.250 --> 04:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
with that you have red and blue States
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
no question
 
04:43:02.690 --> 04:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think this is really a
 
04:43:04.670 --> 04:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
politics issue this is an issue dealing
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
with uh in our revenues you know we talk
 
04:43:08.750 --> 04:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
about we haven't talked about that I'll
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
let Finance talk about that whether it's
 
04:43:13.250 --> 04:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
20 or 40 million dollars but it there
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
there are some significant factors here
 
04:43:18.288 --> 04:43:18.298 align:start position:0%
with this I see more bang for the buck
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
believe it or not in this program than I
 
04:43:23.570 --> 04:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
do even in school building 8. School
 
04:43:26.690 --> 04:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
building Aid affects one two maybe three
 
04:43:29.930 --> 04:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
schools a year that's great for them but
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide it doesn't reach this program
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
reaches every district and so that will
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
be the impact for direct Medicaid and so
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
with that I will support this bill it's
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a timely measure and
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
we need to move forward and and get
 
04:43:54.410 --> 04:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
involved with this program thank you
 
04:43:58.010 --> 04:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:44:02.090 --> 04:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear and examine
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
what we're actually talking about doing
 
04:44:06.410 --> 04:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
here which is it's entering a new
 
04:44:10.610 --> 04:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
federal pilot program put on by the USDA
 
04:44:13.010 --> 04:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
and it's looking to expand our access to
 
04:44:16.250 --> 04:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
the uh an existing Federal program
 
04:44:16.260 --> 04:44:17.208 align:start position:0%
the uh an existing Federal program
um

04:44:17.208 --> 04:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:20.330 --> 04:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
now let's talk about what's going on
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
some of the problems we're dealing with
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
in the schools we've talked we've seen
 
04:44:26.330 --> 04:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
lately we're going to hold a hearing in
 
04:44:27.770 --> 04:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
this room pretty soon we'll hear from
 
04:44:30.050 --> 04:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
people about some of the inappropriate
 
04:44:31.610 --> 04:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
books that have made their way into some
 
04:44:33.288 --> 04:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
School classrooms and into some
 
04:44:35.330 --> 04:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
libraries how do you think someone got
 
04:44:35.340 --> 04:44:36.410 align:start position:0%
libraries how do you think someone got
there

04:44:36.410 --> 04:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:44:38.930 --> 04:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
Federal mandates from federal programs
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
where you think Common Core comes from
 
04:44:44.650 --> 04:44:44.660 align:start position:0%
federal mandates and federal programs
 
04:44:47.270 --> 04:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard people say that the cost to
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
us is nothing to enter into this
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
I disagree the cost to us to enter into
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
these Federal programs is State
 
04:44:54.060 --> 04:44:55.310 align:start position:0%
these Federal programs is State
sovereignty

04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
we seed the powers do this body as
 
04:44:59.570 --> 04:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:45:02.208 --> 04:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
Constitution and we give those powers to
 
04:45:04.010 --> 04:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
the federal government to hold us
 
04:45:06.170 --> 04:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
basically at at harm
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
in order to get Federal funding from
 
04:45:07.920 --> 04:45:08.750 align:start position:0%
in order to get Federal funding from
them

04:45:08.750 --> 04:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:45:10.970 --> 04:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
I believe that's a process that across
 
04:45:13.128 --> 04:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
the board needs to be reversed that is
 
04:45:15.170 --> 04:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
why I will not be supporting this
 
04:45:15.180 --> 04:45:19.490 align:start position:0%
why I will not be supporting this
representative

04:45:19.490 --> 04:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.770 --> 04:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
I have a whole lot of questions about
 
04:45:23.448 --> 04:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
and an alternate alternative solution
 
04:45:29.810 --> 04:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
I spent some time talking to our numbers
 
04:45:32.690 --> 04:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
people who were here
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues I have is
 
04:45:38.448 --> 04:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
supposedly they will be
 
04:45:38.458 --> 04:45:40.610 align:start position:0%
supposedly they will be
directly

04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
directly
 
04:45:40.620 --> 04:45:42.010 align:start position:0%
directly
um

04:45:42.010 --> 04:45:42.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
okaying the food program and yet we are
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
not sending any of our information also
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
supposedly to the federal government
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
we're only sending numbers well if we're
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
only sending numbers how are we getting
 
04:46:00.170 --> 04:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
those lists
 
04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
either we're sending more than either
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're sending more than just numbers or
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
all they're doing is giving us
 
04:46:09.410 --> 04:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
permission to use our own data
 
04:46:12.170 --> 04:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
to do data matching and why do we have
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
to go to the federal government to do
 
04:46:16.128 --> 04:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
that well because they put those strings
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
on it
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
and we can't even use our own data
 
04:46:20.638 --> 04:46:21.890 align:start position:0%
and we can't even use our own data
um

04:46:21.890 --> 04:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
as far as funding goes and using those
 
04:46:27.170 --> 04:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
numbers for funding
 
04:46:30.050 --> 04:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
we can get those numbers currently
 
04:46:34.570 --> 04:46:34.580 align:start position:0%
according to the USDA and everything
 
04:46:39.650 --> 04:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
that our own Medicaid has permission to
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
share the numbers of people on Medicaid
 
04:46:45.770 --> 04:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
Town by town so we don't have to enter
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
another Federal program with Federal
 
04:46:51.770 --> 04:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
strings who may not let us opt out like
 
04:46:54.650 --> 04:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
they were talking about he may not let
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
us do anything and once we are in that
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
program they hold all of our free and
 
04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch students hostage all of
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
that money hostage should we again it
 
04:47:08.570 --> 04:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
says right in the application if we
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
apply for the program we promise we will
 
04:47:13.490 --> 04:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
follow through and they have the right
 
04:47:15.730 --> 04:47:15.740 align:start position:0%
to change the qualification
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
qualifications and everything else at
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
any time so at any time they can require
 
04:47:23.930 --> 04:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
anything else they want and if we don't
 
04:47:27.050 --> 04:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
and if we disagree like we say no we
 
04:47:29.330 --> 04:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
want our parents to be able to opt out
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
oh all they can sell they have full
 
04:47:35.448 --> 04:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
right to say fine you cannot do that but
 
04:47:37.550 --> 04:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to give you any free and
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
reduced luncheon money anymore
 
04:47:42.410 --> 04:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
and they I mean we've seen that in just
 
04:47:44.690 --> 04:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
the last few years fine we're going to
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
withhold your Medicaid money fine we're
 
04:47:48.288 --> 04:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
going to withhold your Medicare money if
 
04:47:50.208 --> 04:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
I you know if you don't do what we say
 
04:47:53.208 --> 04:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
and so why should we entangle ourselves
 
04:47:56.208 --> 04:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
further with the federal government when
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
we have a method right now that we could
 
04:48:01.368 --> 04:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
use and this was suggested by the many
 
04:48:03.948 --> 04:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
people who came and talked to us that
 
04:48:06.530 --> 04:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
they can right now release
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
to us per town the number of students or
 
04:48:12.410 --> 04:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
the number of people in any town on
 
04:48:15.650 --> 04:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
Medicaid which completely eliminates the
 
04:48:15.660 --> 04:48:16.570 align:start position:0%
Medicaid which completely eliminates the
the

04:48:16.570 --> 04:48:16.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:19.128 --> 04:48:19.138 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
04:48:21.770 --> 04:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
older kids not wanting to be on free and
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
04:48:25.610 --> 04:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
you know and therefore our numbers are
 
04:48:28.190 --> 04:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
low we still get their numbers
 
04:48:30.410 --> 04:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
they don't have to take home a piece of
 
04:48:33.230 --> 04:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
paper and apply when they don't want to
 
04:48:36.890 --> 04:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
we still get their numbers it also the
 
04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
whole thing with
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
tax evaluations as we talked about
 
04:48:49.850 --> 04:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's a measure of wealth and not a
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
measure of income which you then have
 
04:48:55.250 --> 04:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
towns who yes their property values went
 
04:48:56.930 --> 04:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
up but no they didn't get any more money
 
04:48:58.850 --> 04:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
they won't unless they sell their
 
04:49:01.970 --> 04:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
property it gets rid of all of that we
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
can it is a different way of coming up
 
04:49:07.788 --> 04:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
with funding that we have at our access
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
at our fingertips right now
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
that we can use and that's the Medicaid
 
04:49:16.490 --> 04:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
numbers so many per town and we can use
 
04:49:19.190 --> 04:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
that to come up with a you know to with
 
04:49:21.288 --> 04:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
our own funding formula where we don't
 
04:49:23.208 --> 04:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
have to rely on free and reduced lunch
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to rely on on
 
04:49:26.638 --> 04:49:28.970 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to rely on on
um

04:49:28.970 --> 04:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
um evaluation that can that can unfairly
 
04:49:35.090 --> 04:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
Target towns that have
 
04:49:35.100 --> 04:49:36.530 align:start position:0%
Target towns that have
uh

04:49:36.530 --> 04:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:39.470 --> 04:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
great increase in
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
in uh desirability while because they
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
have low
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
availability and therefore you know the
 
04:49:50.448 --> 04:49:50.458 align:start position:0%
most recent thing buildings that sold
 
04:49:52.010 --> 04:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
sold High
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's fair within a community because
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
everybody gets taxed the same within
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
that Community but when you're comparing
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
communities if we're in community
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
suddenly becomes popular
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean those people who live
 
04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
there have any more money but now
 
04:50:10.368 --> 04:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
suddenly they're getting less money for
 
04:50:12.890 --> 04:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
to educate their students because the
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
last few buildings that sold
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
were sold for a lot of money thank you
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
that at any rate
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock do you have a
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
represent Alice oh thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:50:26.330 --> 04:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
frankly my head is spinning we're
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
getting into local real estate uh the
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
cost of houses the cost of doing a
 
04:50:33.788 --> 04:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
number of things
 
04:50:36.050 --> 04:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
entangling ourselves with the federal
 
04:50:38.930 --> 04:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
government this bill if it's passed is
 
04:50:41.208 --> 04:50:41.218 align:start position:0%
going to feed 9 000 more New Hampshire
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
kids and I will vote for any bill that
 
04:50:47.570 --> 04:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
increases funding for feeding kids
 
04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
I think the important part is it
 
04:50:52.850 --> 04:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
increases eligibility well okay for our
 
04:50:56.570 --> 04:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
program and that's that's I know that's
 
04:50:58.030 --> 04:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
what you meant
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'll take six thousand how's that we're
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
getting wild up here it certainly is
 
04:51:03.240 --> 04:51:05.208 align:start position:0%
getting wild up here it certainly is
representative

04:51:05.208 --> 04:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:08.628 --> 04:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
cascadden thank you Mr chair
 
04:51:10.730 --> 04:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I want to speak for the people who
 
04:51:12.650 --> 04:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
cannot have a voice at this table and
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's all of our kids
 
04:51:17.330 --> 04:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I will definitely support 601
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
because I went on record
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
um that I am doing my part whatever I
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
can do to decrease food insecurity in
 
04:51:28.368 --> 04:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:38.090 --> 04:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I see uh a larger problem here in
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we have data matching already going
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
on Direct certification for snap and
 
04:51:43.200 --> 04:51:44.208 align:start position:0%
on Direct certification for snap and
TANF

04:51:44.208 --> 04:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
TANF
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's nowhere in statute
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere in rules as we heard
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
it was done agreement between a couple
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
of executive departments and the FEDS no
 
04:51:57.170 --> 04:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
legislative input
 
04:51:59.330 --> 04:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
I think that's a huge problem we heard
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
testimony that they had an opt-out
 
04:52:01.798 --> 04:52:03.530 align:start position:0%
testimony that they had an opt-out
provision

04:52:03.530 --> 04:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:52:06.530 --> 04:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I think it was for SNAP but somehow
 
04:52:09.050 --> 04:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
it went away in the quote last
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
Administration and they're looking at
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
bringing it back now
 
04:52:16.368 --> 04:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
but there's no no nothing in statute we
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any input hands off now
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
but yet
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
this the opt-out went away from that
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
program who's to say it's not going to
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
go away from this program and tell me
 
04:52:31.550 --> 04:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
where does this go in statute it is not
 
04:52:33.770 --> 04:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
going in statute anywhere there is no
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
RSA identified here it's going to be the
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
same type thing as with the snap and tan
 
04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
of programs it's not in statute it's an
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
act it's they're just going to make the
 
04:52:50.208 --> 04:52:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.128 --> 04:52:55.138 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent paternal
 
04:52:56.930 --> 04:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm on the U.S well I have a handout
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
that I printed from the USDA food and
 
04:53:05.090 --> 04:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
nutrition service and this from
 
04:53:07.490 --> 04:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
September 10 2021 but it says direct
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
certification has the potential to
 
04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
improve student access to school meals
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative burden for schools
 
04:53:18.250 --> 04:53:18.260 align:start position:0%
and families and improve certification
 
04:53:20.448 --> 04:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
accuracy but cannot be used to
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
negatively impact any child
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there's 39 States
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
involved in this already do we have any
 
04:53:30.530 --> 04:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
information that shows that they've
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
improved their ability to
 
04:53:36.770 --> 04:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
feed students
 
04:53:39.288 --> 04:53:39.298 align:start position:0%
but use by using this program
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
um the state that I know the most about
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
is Massachusetts and the school
 
04:53:48.530 --> 04:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
districts have been very pleased with
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
this they don't have to send home the
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
frame reduced lunch forms anymore the
 
04:54:00.170 --> 04:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
overall amount of federal funds being
 
04:54:03.410 --> 04:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
sent to a school district is driven by
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
those counts and this makes it more
 
04:54:07.490 --> 04:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
accurate as I said
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
um previously when I was here the other
 
04:54:12.530 --> 04:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
day that it's so important to have good
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
accurate numbers about the children who
 
04:54:17.208 --> 04:54:17.218 align:start position:0%
are living in disadvantaged households
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
and um in terms of the the Department of
 
04:54:23.090 --> 04:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
Agriculture when they developed this
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
program the direct certification program
 
04:54:27.490 --> 04:54:27.500 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
the other programs were in existence and
 
04:54:33.890 --> 04:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
it was in federal legislation so the
 
04:54:36.890 --> 04:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
states just adopted those practices in
 
04:54:40.190 --> 04:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
the case of Medicaid that had not been
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
put into statute yet and that's why it's
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
a new program to this process
 
04:54:50.090 --> 04:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
in actuality what this bill really does
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
is simply it directs Health and Human
 
04:54:55.750 --> 04:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
Services and the Department of Education
 
04:54:58.910 --> 04:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
to enroll the state in this direct
 
04:55:02.570 --> 04:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
certification program the winner of all
 
04:55:04.610 --> 04:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
of this of the children
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
and their their it will decrease the
 
04:55:10.910 --> 04:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
overall number of Portugal not poor
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
children children being hungry so I mean
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win for schools the
 
04:55:17.090 --> 04:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
Manchester school district has made this
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
a priority they asked me to submit this
 
04:55:20.040 --> 04:55:21.050 align:start position:0%
a priority they asked me to submit this
bill

04:55:21.050 --> 04:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:55:23.090 --> 04:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and those of us who represent the
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester they asked us to make
 
04:55:29.690 --> 04:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
this a priority so um they felt it was
 
04:55:32.810 --> 04:55:32.820 align:start position:0%
very important it will increase the
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
number of children that are eligible it
 
04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
will decrease the amount of
 
04:55:40.190 --> 04:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
administrative paperwork in the states
 
04:55:42.190 --> 04:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
as we've seen in Massachusetts
 
04:55:44.090 --> 04:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
superintendents love it because they
 
04:55:46.368 --> 04:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
don't have to chase a lot of paperwork
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting those papers home to parents and
 
04:55:49.440 --> 04:55:51.170 align:start position:0%
getting those papers home to parents and
back

04:55:51.170 --> 04:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
people don't always do it they don't
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
always find the way home
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
um kids forget about it in their
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
backpack they get washed any number of
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
things happen to them and this
 
04:56:02.570 --> 04:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
alleviates all that
 
04:56:04.670 --> 04:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
and it's just all the way around it's
 
04:56:06.288 --> 04:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
better it's better for our food
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
nutrition program at the department of
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
Ed they have better numbers so I really
 
04:56:12.530 --> 04:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
and truly hope you'll support this bill
 
04:56:14.990 --> 04:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
it is it is a good thing and it will do
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
good things I just really can't see
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
anything negative about it
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
um there are some pieces of legislation
 
04:56:25.788 --> 04:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
in our doe that may have to be tweaked a
 
04:56:27.650 --> 04:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
little bit I don't know but the
 
04:56:30.890 --> 04:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
information that's being asked I believe
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
um right now
 
04:56:34.850 --> 04:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
um it's very possible the way it stands
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
now and the way the department and
 
04:56:38.930 --> 04:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services described it
 
04:56:41.930 --> 04:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
when they were here made it absolutely
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
positive that if a parent did not want
 
04:56:47.570 --> 04:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
their information shared they did not
 
04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
want their child to participate then
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
they do have an opt-out option there so
 
04:56:55.250 --> 04:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
I hope you consider this it's really
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win for US state thank you
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%

04:57:03.170 --> 04:57:03.180 align:start position:0%

question Texas has been doing Medicaid
 
04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
direct certification for seven years
 
04:57:14.330 --> 04:57:14.340 align:start position:0%

04:57:16.970 --> 04:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
certified for School meals
 
04:57:18.830 --> 04:57:18.840 align:start position:0%

certification for snap and tana for 16
 
04:57:22.730 --> 04:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
years so
 
04:57:24.890 --> 04:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
we're extending something that is not
 
04:57:27.050 --> 04:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
really new in the way information is
 
04:57:27.060 --> 04:57:28.310 align:start position:0%

05:11:55.010 --> 05:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:57.170 --> 05:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:11:57.180 --> 05:12:00.410 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
and

05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.420 --> 05:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:12:07.490 --> 05:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
and many of these are children for whom
 
05:12:07.500 --> 05:12:09.470 align:start position:0%
and many of these are children for whom
um

05:12:09.470 --> 05:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:11.448 --> 05:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
whether they're moving around between
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
one school and another if they were in
 
05:12:15.948 --> 05:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
the public school or whether they were
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the public school and had problems
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
with bullying and other issues
 
05:12:22.910 --> 05:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:12:26.930 --> 05:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
um reasonable for them to be not in the
 
05:12:29.410 --> 05:12:29.420 align:start position:0%
public school and this provides funding
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
for those students
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
still to be able to get an adequate
 
05:12:37.970 --> 05:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
education using
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
adequate education funds
 
05:12:44.510 --> 05:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much money their
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
parents make and a lot of these they
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
those who are placed in in foster care
 
05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
and whatever we don't even know
 
05:12:56.690 --> 05:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
necessarily how much their parents make
 
05:12:58.610 --> 05:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
and the foster care people that's
 
05:12:58.620 --> 05:12:59.810 align:start position:0%
and the foster care people that's
irrelevant

05:12:59.810 --> 05:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
irrelevant
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
so at any rate I would ask that you pass
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
this please
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
05:13:11.690 --> 05:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I would just um
 
05:13:14.270 --> 05:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
second that and elaborate that this bill
 
05:13:16.010 --> 05:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
really looks at students with special
 
05:13:19.610 --> 05:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances students who are who may
 
05:13:22.368 --> 05:13:22.378 align:start position:0%
be um children of our soldiers who have
 
05:13:24.770 --> 05:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
to move around a lot children who have
 
05:13:27.410 --> 05:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
been bullied repeatedly at their schools
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
and just because their parents are are
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
middle class not even wealthy middle
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
class doesn't mean they should be
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited from using the EFA program to
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
move their child to a safer environment
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and that that's the nature of this
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill it shouldn't be it shouldn't be
 
05:13:44.208 --> 05:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
particularly objectionable it probably
 
05:13:47.390 --> 05:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect a ton of students
 
05:13:51.708 --> 05:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you for the discussion
 
05:13:54.410 --> 05:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
this thing I was like
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I understand the intent of the bill
 
05:14:03.288 --> 05:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
um it clearly securely opens uh the
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility for uh certain uh uh groups
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
of students uh
 
05:14:12.410 --> 05:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that the bullying is listed
 
05:14:13.970 --> 05:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
in here is one of the categories but
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
probably is I guess persistent
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
persistently but you know how you
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
measure that but that's not my issue my
 
05:14:21.410 --> 05:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
issue is the same one not the same one
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
one of the same ones that have
 
05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly representative ads since this
 
05:14:29.570 --> 05:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
bill uh came to uh B and that is once
 
05:14:31.368 --> 05:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
the initial threshold of Eligibility is
 
05:14:33.770 --> 05:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
established it should be in my mind like
 
05:14:36.350 --> 05:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
any other eligibility program that you
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
recertify on a regular basis uh and not
 
05:14:40.670 --> 05:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
that you come in once and then you
 
05:14:43.610 --> 05:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
whatever your income level is it that
 
05:14:46.010 --> 05:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
you're there forever the intent of
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
Eligibility programs is exactly that to
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
keep those that are eligible within that
 
05:14:51.840 --> 05:14:52.970 align:start position:0%
keep those that are eligible within that
guideline

05:14:52.970 --> 05:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
guideline
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
um or certain in this particular case as
 
05:14:57.288 --> 05:14:57.298 align:start position:0%
an income domain and in the larger
 
05:14:59.628 --> 05:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
program which is the part of it's not
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
there you qualify one year and you
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
qualify forever and just seeing it
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to make any sense to me you
 
05:15:08.690 --> 05:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
make 57 000 as a family of four and
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
Conway you're eligible for these major
 
05:15:14.030 --> 05:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for poverty you make 250 000
 
05:15:15.470 --> 05:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
that's not what this says year two year
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
three just keeps going up so uh just for
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
that part alone I think I think it's a
 
05:15:25.368 --> 05:15:25.378 align:start position:0%
very uh poorly presented bill in terms
 
05:15:29.410 --> 05:15:29.420 align:start position:0%
of that requisite thank you
 
05:15:33.890 --> 05:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
yes I will remind you that when this
 
05:15:36.780 --> 05:15:38.868 align:start position:0%
yes I will remind you that when this
this

05:15:38.868 --> 05:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
idea of efas was originally introduced
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
there was no cap it was never intended
 
05:15:47.570 --> 05:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
to be only for poor people but
 
05:15:50.810 --> 05:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
um the reason for only having them
 
05:15:53.868 --> 05:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
qualify the first year was so you don't
 
05:15:57.410 --> 05:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
keep yanking a kid around depending upon
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
how much how much money their parents
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
make that year they have a good year so
 
05:16:03.530 --> 05:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
now we've got to take them out of the
 
05:16:06.890 --> 05:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
EFA and now they can't afford to go
 
05:16:08.570 --> 05:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
wherever they were going and were happy
 
05:16:10.250 --> 05:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
and so they end up back in the public
 
05:16:12.170 --> 05:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
school but then the next year their
 
05:16:14.090 --> 05:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
parents have a worse year and now we
 
05:16:16.368 --> 05:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
yank them out you know the whole idea
 
05:16:16.378 --> 05:16:17.570 align:start position:0%
yank them out you know the whole idea
was

05:16:17.570 --> 05:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:16:20.930 --> 05:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
find a place that works for the kid and
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
leave them there and not keep yanking
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
them around depending upon how much
 
05:16:27.770 --> 05:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
money a parent makes that year compared
 
05:16:31.128 --> 05:16:31.138 align:start position:0%
to the next year further discussion
 
05:16:33.350 --> 05:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Luna yeah thank you very
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair so it so if um if a parent
 
05:16:40.430 --> 05:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
goes from uh or family goes from
 
05:16:43.310 --> 05:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
qualifying for an EFA in one year and
 
05:16:46.128 --> 05:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
then maybe another a year later they
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
they do really well uh financially
 
05:16:49.920 --> 05:16:51.170 align:start position:0%
they do really well uh financially
um

05:16:51.170 --> 05:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
under current law I believe they have to
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
they they can stay in the uh the EFA
 
05:16:59.090 --> 05:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
because there's no annual thing but if
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
there were an annual
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
um thing I think is what you were
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh would there be a requirement when the
 
05:17:08.628 --> 05:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
parents are doing Financial well for the
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
student to leave the private school that
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
they're going to I'm not quite sure I
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
followed what you're saying
 
05:17:16.670 --> 05:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
that was the whole point because just
 
05:17:19.490 --> 05:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
because they make that little bit more
 
05:17:21.890 --> 05:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they can still they can
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
afford to send their kid to that private
 
05:17:25.970 --> 05:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
school and so now they have to remove
 
05:17:27.770 --> 05:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
them from the private school for that
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
year and then the next year maybe the
 
05:17:31.730 --> 05:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
parents do worse and then they can put
 
05:17:34.850 --> 05:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
them back in the private school and as I
 
05:17:37.128 --> 05:17:37.138 align:start position:0%
said originally it was never intended to
 
05:17:41.330 --> 05:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
be income based but even as it was it
 
05:17:43.010 --> 05:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
was written in that they didn't have to
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
re-qualify because we didn't want to be
 
05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
moving kids around if they found
 
05:17:50.090 --> 05:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
something that worked we wanted to make
 
05:17:52.610 --> 05:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
sure they could stay regardless of the
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
fluctuations of their parents income
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
just because a parent makes 300 and 54
 
05:18:01.850 --> 05:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
instead of 300 percent doesn't mean they
 
05:18:04.610 --> 05:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
can pay for that
 
05:18:07.368 --> 05:18:07.378 align:start position:0%
um private school
 
05:18:08.990 --> 05:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
05:18:10.970 --> 05:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
05:18:16.368 --> 05:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
thank you I I find it ironic I well
 
05:18:17.930 --> 05:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
first of all I think this bill is more
 
05:18:17.940 --> 05:18:19.368 align:start position:0%
first of all I think this bill is more
about

05:18:19.368 --> 05:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um categories rather than money uh
 
05:18:24.490 --> 05:18:24.500 align:start position:0%
income levels which you've been debating
 
05:18:26.990 --> 05:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it's ironic that the public
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
school one of the one of the best things
 
05:18:33.050 --> 05:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
about it is it's a safety net for kids
 
05:18:36.050 --> 05:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
and it's a safety net almost for kids in
 
05:18:38.090 --> 05:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
all these different categories
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
some of whose parents are neglectful
 
05:18:43.310 --> 05:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
some whose parents are
 
05:18:46.670 --> 05:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
just not there some whose parents can't
 
05:18:48.410 --> 05:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
support their child for one reason
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
another mental illness or income level
 
05:18:54.530 --> 05:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
or whatever the situation is
 
05:18:57.170 --> 05:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
and I just uh and the school has the
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
public school has
 
05:19:02.208 --> 05:19:02.218 align:start position:0%
set up and bent over backwards in my
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
estimation to meet the needs of kids in
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
each one of these categories and there's
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
outs for them in each one of these
 
05:19:11.990 --> 05:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
categories that manifest hardship that
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
we talked about before for a very few
 
05:19:15.060 --> 05:19:16.368 align:start position:0%
we talked about before for a very few
kids

05:19:16.368 --> 05:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:19:18.170 --> 05:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know qualify for that and um
 
05:19:23.570 --> 05:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
therefore I can't vote for this
 
05:19:25.310 --> 05:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
um or I won't vote for this I'll vote no
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
for this I guess
 
05:19:28.970 --> 05:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
um against the OTP because I think this
 
05:19:31.250 --> 05:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
is what what
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
the for me is one of the main reasons
 
05:19:36.410 --> 05:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
Public Schools exist as a safety after
 
05:19:36.420 --> 05:19:37.368 align:start position:0%
Public Schools exist as a safety after
kids

05:19:37.368 --> 05:19:37.378 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:19:38.690 --> 05:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:41.330 --> 05:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you
 
05:19:44.520 --> 05:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you
um

05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:50.090 --> 05:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
but as we've heard in radio ads from Nea
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
every child is unique and learns
 
05:19:52.320 --> 05:19:53.330 align:start position:0%
every child is unique and learns
differently

05:19:53.330 --> 05:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
differently
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
and every child might not have the
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
perfect match in their local public
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
school that is mandated to them by their
 
05:20:02.878 --> 05:20:04.788 align:start position:0%
school that is mandated to them by their
address

05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:20:07.670 --> 05:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
um these children in particular that
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in these situations
 
05:20:12.650 --> 05:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
where they've
 
05:20:14.690 --> 05:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
been granted a manifest education
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
hardship by the local school district or
 
05:20:19.128 --> 05:20:19.138 align:start position:0%
superintendent because
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
they're not fitting in due to any number
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
of circumstances I know of a case where
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
the child was persistently bullied
 
05:20:30.590 --> 05:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's another one of the categories
 
05:20:32.930 --> 05:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
here that child was granted a manifest
 
05:20:35.448 --> 05:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
education hardship but was denied
 
05:20:38.510 --> 05:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
admittance to the school next School in
 
05:20:40.730 --> 05:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
the next District
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
um I I think that these children were
 
05:20:45.650 --> 05:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here and and
 
05:20:48.770 --> 05:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's about the children
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
um these children
 
05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
um might need
 
05:20:55.190 --> 05:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
um uh situations other than their local
 
05:21:00.190 --> 05:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
public school and because of um income
 
05:21:02.930 --> 05:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
that might fluctuate any number of
 
05:21:02.940 --> 05:21:05.090 align:start position:0%
that might fluctuate any number of
circumstances

05:21:05.090 --> 05:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
um divorce Etc
 
05:21:08.990 --> 05:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think that they shouldn't be shut
 
05:21:11.810 --> 05:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
out of getting the opportunity for the
 
05:21:15.830 --> 05:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.770 --> 05:21:20.780 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative uh
 
05:21:24.110 --> 05:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
and then represent Belcher
 
05:21:25.910 --> 05:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to respond to this idea of
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
public school as a safety net
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
um just pointing out because I can't I
 
05:21:32.030 --> 05:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
can't help it is that persistently
 
05:21:33.890 --> 05:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
bullied students and persistently
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
students in a persistently dangerous
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
school have obviously not not found that
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we failed them there so that's just
 
05:21:43.250 --> 05:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
two I just want to speak up for those
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
two groups just put that out there
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
05:21:49.550 --> 05:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
chair I just I just wanted to make the
 
05:21:51.310 --> 05:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
very brief point that
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about spending this
 
05:21:55.550 --> 05:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
money on on these students it's not like
 
05:21:57.470 --> 05:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're sending this money overseas or
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
something like that we are talking about
 
05:22:01.490 --> 05:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents New Hampshire
 
05:22:04.010 --> 05:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who have paid into this system
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
just like they paid in the Social
 
05:22:07.970 --> 05:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
Security their entire lives and all
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're looking for is to be able to
 
05:22:12.050 --> 05:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
utilize that promise that we made to
 
05:22:12.060 --> 05:22:13.010 align:start position:0%
utilize that promise that we made to
them

05:22:13.010 --> 05:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
for education
 
05:22:17.930 --> 05:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you represent McDonald thank you
 
05:22:19.540 --> 05:22:19.550 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:22:19.550 --> 05:22:21.890 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
[Laughter]

05:22:21.890 --> 05:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:22:25.208 --> 05:22:25.218 align:start position:0%
I guess you're done you're welcome
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
so what you do it's just shopping with
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
I would like to say that on this
 
05:22:44.810 --> 05:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
committee we are responsible for
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
students and for children and no student
 
05:22:49.730 --> 05:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
should suffer because of their parents
 
05:22:51.890 --> 05:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
inability to pay and just as we were
 
05:22:53.690 --> 05:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
talking about moments ago relating to
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
feeding children a student shouldn't go
 
05:22:57.050 --> 05:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
hungry because of their parents
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
inability to pay for a meal and in the
 
05:23:01.490 --> 05:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
same way these students who are equally
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
as vulnerable in other ways such as
 
05:23:05.208 --> 05:23:05.218 align:start position:0%
persistently bullied we had someone
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
testify about the safety concerns of her
 
05:23:10.010 --> 05:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
son and she moved her child to a
 
05:23:11.930 --> 05:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
different model from the traditional
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
Public School model and she found it was
 
05:23:16.250 --> 05:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
safer and should that student suffer
 
05:23:19.128 --> 05:23:19.138 align:start position:0%
because of her his parents on ability to
 
05:23:21.288 --> 05:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
pay and just as we were talking moments
 
05:23:23.448 --> 05:23:23.458 align:start position:0%
ago I see it similarly to feeding
 
05:23:25.310 --> 05:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
students no student really should suffer
 
05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
and that's why I support this program
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly thank you thank you
 
05:23:34.010 --> 05:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Tanner yeah
 
05:23:35.930 --> 05:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
I just uh would like to point out that
 
05:23:37.970 --> 05:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about guard rails
 
05:23:40.670 --> 05:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
for the program and and safe safety net
 
05:23:43.128 --> 05:23:43.138 align:start position:0%
is the is the guard rails for for public
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
education and also that
 
05:23:45.840 --> 05:23:46.788 align:start position:0%
education and also that
that

05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:49.550 --> 05:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I I remember that uh the woman that
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
came with the with the child that was
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
bullied and got a manifest hardship and
 
05:23:55.330 --> 05:23:55.340 align:start position:0%
she was
 
05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
appalled actually well I'd take that
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
back she was extremely upset because she
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
could not find another school that would
 
05:24:05.690 --> 05:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
take her child whether it was a school
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
close to her or whatever and I just want
 
05:24:10.610 --> 05:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
to point out how school choice is really
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
with the schools not with the parents
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that if the if a parent wanted their
 
05:24:18.170 --> 05:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
child to go to say Phillips Exeter
 
05:24:18.180 --> 05:24:19.670 align:start position:0%
child to go to say Phillips Exeter
Academy

05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
05:24:21.948 --> 05:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
um Phillips Exeter Academy still screens
 
05:24:24.288 --> 05:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
that child to decide whether they want
 
05:24:26.628 --> 05:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
that child or not so
 
05:24:30.650 --> 05:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:33.170 --> 05:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
represent Ellison oh thank you Mr chair
 
05:24:35.448 --> 05:24:35.458 align:start position:0%
one of the categories in the bill is is
 
05:24:37.090 --> 05:24:37.100 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
05:24:41.208 --> 05:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility because the the students
 
05:24:44.868 --> 05:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a I guess persistently
 
05:24:48.170 --> 05:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
dangerous school you know and it cites
 
05:24:48.180 --> 05:24:49.570 align:start position:0%
dangerous school you know and it cites
RSA

05:24:49.570 --> 05:24:49.580 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
193-g dot one is there anyone that knows
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
how many persistently dangerous schools
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
have been identified by the Department
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:02.628 --> 05:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
person Damon you know
 
05:25:04.730 --> 05:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
that question was asked after the
 
05:25:07.610 --> 05:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
hearing and I was told that there have
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
not been any in New Hampshire for the 12
 
05:25:13.730 --> 05:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:16.550 --> 05:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
05:25:16.560 --> 05:25:19.190 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
committee

05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh Madam clerk we have a

um I I think that um
 
05:26:42.590 --> 05:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the public school system is the
 
05:26:46.610 --> 05:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
safety net and uh covers a lot of these
 
05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:48.298 align:start position:0%
areas and
 
05:26:50.330 --> 05:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I we need guard rails for this
 
05:26:52.560 --> 05:26:53.810 align:start position:0%
I'm I we need guard rails for this
program

05:26:53.810 --> 05:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:26:57.530 --> 05:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:58.850 --> 05:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:27:01.550 --> 05:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
Cornell and I just like I checked the
 
05:27:01.560 --> 05:27:02.510 align:start position:0%
Cornell and I just like I checked the
online

05:27:02.510 --> 05:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:27:04.970 --> 05:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
um support and opposition to this and I
 
05:27:07.250 --> 05:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
just like to bring up the um 300 people
 
05:27:11.510 --> 05:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill and 27 supported it
 
05:27:13.310 --> 05:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
um which I know sometimes doesn't matter
 
05:27:14.930 --> 05:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
because the last time we discussed this
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
4 000 people opposed it and I think
 
05:27:18.770 --> 05:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
there were only 300 that supported it
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
but the the people that signed in online
 
05:27:26.448 --> 05:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against this bill and
 
05:27:33.288 --> 05:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
any other bills to expand the EFA
 
05:27:36.170 --> 05:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
program until we have an accountability
 
05:27:38.208 --> 05:27:38.218 align:start position:0%
system for what quality of Education
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
those students are getting that is
 
05:27:41.930 --> 05:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
comparable or the same as the public
 
05:27:41.940 --> 05:27:45.948 align:start position:0%
comparable or the same as the public
schools

05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.110 --> 05:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
I just want to relate an experience that
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
I had and
 
05:27:52.128 --> 05:27:52.138 align:start position:0%
the only way I could have helped in this
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
experience well what happened is I had a
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
granddaughter that was in eighth grade
 
05:27:59.448 --> 05:27:59.458 align:start position:0%
and that had been bullied and bullied
 
05:28:00.590 --> 05:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
and bullied
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
and I had a wonderful relationship with
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
the principal and with the counselor as
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
well and the teachers but the bullying
 
05:28:11.090 --> 05:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
continued on the side from the students
 
05:28:13.970 --> 05:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
and it couldn't be stopped and at the
 
05:28:15.890 --> 05:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
eighth end of the eighth grade I had to
 
05:28:18.650 --> 05:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
make that decision along with my wife
 
05:28:20.690 --> 05:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's going to go on again now to the
 
05:28:24.770 --> 05:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
high school from the Middle School
 
05:28:27.770 --> 05:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
and have this trailing behind her
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
and there was only one option in the
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
valley that I live in one option
 
05:28:34.730 --> 05:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
and that was to go to St Johnsbury
 
05:28:34.740 --> 05:28:36.050 align:start position:0%
and that was to go to St Johnsbury
Academy

05:28:36.050 --> 05:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
over in Vermont that caused 60 at the
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.610 --> 05:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
we felt that we really had to figure out
 
05:28:50.448 --> 05:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
how to pay that tuition and we did but
 
05:28:52.128 --> 05:28:52.138 align:start position:0%
an EFA would have certainly helped
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
because my income level was that above
 
05:28:56.330 --> 05:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
the 300 percent
 
05:28:59.030 --> 05:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
and so there was no other option for us
 
05:29:01.850 --> 05:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
we made the right decision
 
05:29:04.910 --> 05:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
she graded for graduated from Saint Jay
 
05:29:07.730 --> 05:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
went on to Dean's List for four years at
 
05:29:10.550 --> 05:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
UMaine and Captain the track team
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
and and was a very very successful
 
05:29:16.430 --> 05:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
student however when she left that
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
Middle School
 
05:29:20.030 --> 05:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
she was right down in the dumps and we
 
05:29:22.550 --> 05:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't help in any way we we tried
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
everything so there are situations I
 
05:29:26.810 --> 05:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
believe where the EFA program really
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
does serve a purpose and that's one of
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
them where if it had been a place
 
05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
it would have helped grandpa in terms of
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with that part of the
 
05:29:39.410 --> 05:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
money so that's where things are
 
05:29:41.628 --> 05:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
programs like this do help
 
05:29:44.930 --> 05:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.690 --> 05:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to we we're you know if
 
05:29:50.030 --> 05:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's any more discussion here
 
05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
would uh Madam clerk would you please

have been but that looks to me by the
 
05:31:22.310 --> 05:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:24.350 --> 05:31:24.360 align:start position:0%

05:32:22.550 --> 05:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
purpose and Belcher would you like to uh

yes thank you Mr chair and I'll explain
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
my rationale here and my other people
 
05:32:34.730 --> 05:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
are free to explain if they have other
 
05:32:34.740 --> 05:32:36.470 align:start position:0%
are free to explain if they have other
rationales

05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
rationales
 
05:32:39.770 --> 05:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
um so let me first say current law
 
05:32:43.070 --> 05:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh authorizer rather mandates a testing
 
05:32:43.080 --> 05:32:44.030 align:start position:0%
uh authorizer rather mandates a testing
for

05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:32:46.850 --> 05:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
um dyslexia upon entry to kindergarten
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
or first grade as well as inappropriate
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
times thereafter
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would seek to increase that by
 
05:32:55.550 --> 05:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
quite a lot I believe
 
05:32:58.610 --> 05:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
maybe seven overall at least
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
um we heard in testimony from the
 
05:33:03.050 --> 05:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
experts over the view that this task
 
05:33:04.970 --> 05:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
like any test is not perfect
 
05:33:07.250 --> 05:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
that there is an error rate in this test
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
for false positives and we do not know
 
05:33:13.128 --> 05:33:13.138 align:start position:0%
what that rate is as of right now I
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
think it would be an appropriate to move
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
forward without knowing what that rate
 
05:33:17.410 --> 05:33:17.420 align:start position:0%
is because very simply put
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
at some point there's a correct number
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
of tests where we're kind of going to
 
05:33:23.570 --> 05:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
Plate two we get the correct number but
 
05:33:25.310 --> 05:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
then when we continue testing after that
 
05:33:26.570 --> 05:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
point we're going to be catching more
 
05:33:28.310 --> 05:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
people who don't have dyslexia but have
 
05:33:29.930 --> 05:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
false positives and they're going to
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
have their educations disrupted
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps mildly perhaps severely
 
05:33:35.390 --> 05:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
depending on if they get placed on a
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
pathway to an IEP or something like that
 
05:33:39.050 --> 05:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
they don't actually need so I would like
 
05:33:41.990 --> 05:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
to see the numbers involved for an error
 
05:33:44.930 --> 05:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
rate on this test before we take action
 
05:33:47.570 --> 05:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
on increasing rates beyond what they
 
05:33:50.930 --> 05:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:55.368 --> 05:33:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:57.470 --> 05:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
05:33:57.480 --> 05:33:58.730 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
yes

05:33:58.730 --> 05:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:34:01.250 --> 05:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what it is with Felts
 
05:34:01.260 --> 05:34:02.208 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what it is with Felts
positives

05:34:02.208 --> 05:34:02.218 align:start position:0%
positives
 
05:34:04.550 --> 05:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
um they're usually relatively small when
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
a test has been gone through and and put
 
05:34:10.850 --> 05:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
on the market and substantiated so I
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
really don't have that number but it's
 
05:34:14.570 --> 05:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
my my
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
um experience with testing is that if
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's an approved test the error rates
 
05:34:18.718 --> 05:34:20.208 align:start position:0%
it's an approved test the error rates
low

05:34:20.208 --> 05:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
low
 
05:34:20.218 --> 05:34:20.810 align:start position:0%
low
um

05:34:20.810 --> 05:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment to this bill which
 
05:34:25.400 --> 05:34:25.410 align:start position:0%
will speak to the number of tests
 
05:34:25.410 --> 05:34:26.570 align:start position:0%
will speak to the number of tests
[Applause]

05:34:26.570 --> 05:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
05:34:29.690 --> 05:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
um dyslexia as we heard from people that
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
came here is devastating that oftentimes
 
05:34:35.390 --> 05:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
because it's the person is of high
 
05:34:38.830 --> 05:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
intelligence and can hide the dyslexia
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the ability the fact that they can't
 
05:34:44.090 --> 05:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
read for many years and then when it
 
05:34:46.490 --> 05:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
finally catches up with them uh they've
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
they've been through a period of time
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
where they can't read and I think I
 
05:34:51.770 --> 05:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned this before
 
05:34:53.930 --> 05:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
I used to teach swimming and if somebody
 
05:34:55.730 --> 05:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to swim before they were
 
05:34:55.740 --> 05:34:56.590 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to swim before they were
16

05:34:56.590 --> 05:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
16
 
05:34:59.150 --> 05:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
it was very difficult to teach them
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
swimming much more difficult than it is
 
05:35:03.288 --> 05:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
when they're younger and dyslexia
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
reading is the same thing that if they
 
05:35:07.610 --> 05:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
can't read and they get to a certain
 
05:35:10.550 --> 05:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
level it's very difficult and they
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
suffer a lot of discrimination up to
 
05:35:14.628 --> 05:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
that point as well for being a
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
non-reader so I think this bill is you
 
05:35:21.128 --> 05:35:21.138 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be retained it needs to be
 
05:35:24.410 --> 05:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
looked at right now people in the
 
05:35:27.770 --> 05:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
dyslexia group were the people that that
 
05:35:30.288 --> 05:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
actually sponsored this bill and and
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
came forward saying that you know they
 
05:35:36.410 --> 05:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
had a child that wasn't diagnosed until
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
after third grade and had not received
 
05:35:40.550 --> 05:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
the adequate testing
 
05:35:42.530 --> 05:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
05:35:44.090 --> 05:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
um I will definitely be voting against
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
the retainment motion thank you uh
 
05:35:50.448 --> 05:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner what is the
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
amendment number that you do have there
 
05:35:53.040 --> 05:35:55.390 align:start position:0%
amendment number that you do have there
um

05:35:55.390 --> 05:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
oh because I'm looking at zero two three
 
05:36:00.770 --> 05:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
four h yeah that was your preceding
 
05:36:02.208 --> 05:36:02.218 align:start position:0%
would you please hand that out to the
 
05:36:02.218 --> 05:36:03.470 align:start position:0%
would you please hand that out to the
committee

05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:36:03.480 --> 05:36:09.890 align:start position:0%
committee
yeah

05:36:09.890 --> 05:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.900 --> 05:36:13.310 align:start position:0%
 
beautiful

05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:13.320 --> 05:36:38.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:41.930 --> 05:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
we do have a motion on on
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
emotions for me to retain but we're in
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
the discussion phase here so I would
 
05:36:49.970 --> 05:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
like to ask at this point in time
 
05:36:51.530 --> 05:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner could you explain
 
05:36:53.390 --> 05:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between zero three
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
five seven H and
 
05:36:55.920 --> 05:36:56.810 align:start position:0%
five seven H and
yeah

05:36:56.810 --> 05:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:36:59.330 --> 05:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
the preceding one you had zero two three
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
four each
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh the one that I had before
 
05:37:04.320 --> 05:37:09.368 align:start position:0%
okay uh the one that I had before
um

05:37:09.368 --> 05:37:09.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:11.930 --> 05:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
05:37:11.940 --> 05:37:13.430 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
um

05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:17.330 --> 05:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
in line 18 uh we had a question about
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
whether how many it said 60 days and
 
05:37:23.330 --> 05:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
we've changed that to 60 school days
 
05:37:25.250 --> 05:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
um so the initial screening shall be
 
05:37:27.288 --> 05:37:27.298 align:start position:0%
completed no later than 60 school days
 
05:37:30.288 --> 05:37:30.298 align:start position:0%
of a student entering the screening
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
shall be repeated one additional time
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
during the current school year and
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
repeated at a minimum of twice yearly
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
through third grade so it isn't the
 
05:37:42.368 --> 05:37:42.378 align:start position:0%
um repeated wanted you know
 
05:37:44.810 --> 05:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
several times
 
05:37:44.820 --> 05:37:45.948 align:start position:0%
several times
um

05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:49.250 --> 05:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
they let's see the other change on line
 
05:37:52.730 --> 05:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
27 you had in the previous Bill the
 
05:37:55.010 --> 05:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
school shall promptly inform this one
 
05:37:56.930 --> 05:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
says the school shall inform right and
 
05:37:58.910 --> 05:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
promptly was taken out because there's
 
05:38:02.330 --> 05:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
no way to measure promptly
 
05:38:05.570 --> 05:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and let's see
 
05:38:05.580 --> 05:38:07.390 align:start position:0%
um and let's see
um

05:38:07.390 --> 05:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:12.550 --> 05:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me and on the back side of the um
 
05:38:17.110 --> 05:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
the part about the
 
05:38:19.970 --> 05:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the the uh
 
05:38:22.368 --> 05:38:22.378 align:start position:0%
reimbursement has been dropped from the
 
05:38:22.378 --> 05:38:24.890 align:start position:0%
reimbursement has been dropped from the
bill

05:38:24.890 --> 05:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:27.890 --> 05:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
so it no longer has that part about the
 
05:38:27.900 --> 05:38:29.570 align:start position:0%
so it no longer has that part about the
reimbursement

05:38:29.570 --> 05:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:38:29.580 --> 05:38:32.990 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
um

05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:35.090 --> 05:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
I think that's it it's kind of hard
 
05:38:35.100 --> 05:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
I think that's it it's kind of hard
because

05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:38:39.770 --> 05:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:43.128 --> 05:38:43.138 align:start position:0%
know so I'm going to request that we
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
have a caucus for a few moments we
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to look at this and
 
05:38:47.520 --> 05:38:48.350 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to look at this and
um

05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:50.750 --> 05:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
I see it does reflect several of the
 
05:38:53.150 --> 05:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
changes which had been brought up
 
05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
at the previous meeting with days it's
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
not defining it as
 
05:38:59.520 --> 05:39:00.530 align:start position:0%
not defining it as
um

05:39:00.530 --> 05:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
school days which is
 
05:39:06.170 --> 05:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
it helps really pin it down that's a big
 
05:39:08.890 --> 05:39:08.900 align:start position:0%
one yeah and the and shall inform
 
05:39:11.690 --> 05:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh verse shall promptly promptly it's
 
05:39:14.270 --> 05:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
one of those lawyer words right and the
 
05:39:16.190 --> 05:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
and the um well I guess that was taken
 
05:39:17.810 --> 05:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
out in the past
 
05:39:20.390 --> 05:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
in the last Amendment we took out the
 
05:39:20.400 --> 05:39:22.128 align:start position:0%
in the last Amendment we took out the
dibles

05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
dibles
 
05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:31.250 --> 05:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
highly trained uh on I think it's 9 11.
 
05:39:31.260 --> 05:39:32.270 align:start position:0%
highly trained uh on I think it's 9 11.
um

05:39:32.270 --> 05:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
because Hailey was a you know kind of a
 
05:39:38.448 --> 05:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
subjective thing so
 
05:39:41.030 --> 05:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
05:39:45.368 --> 05:39:45.378 align:start position:0%
um let's take uh uh a short caucus here
 
05:39:53.110 --> 05:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:55.128 --> 05:39:55.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:03.548 --> 05:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:06.410 --> 05:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
okay we're we're back in exact active
 
05:54:11.030 --> 05:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
session right now and I think here's the
 
05:54:14.090 --> 05:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
the game plan for this one we're not
 
05:54:15.590 --> 05:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
trying to move the goal post farther
 
05:54:17.770 --> 05:54:17.780 align:start position:0%
back we what we recognize here is that
 
05:54:20.570 --> 05:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
there is this is a very important topic
 
05:54:22.670 --> 05:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
we've had several bills we've talked uh
 
05:54:25.310 --> 05:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
quite a bit about you know intervention
 
05:54:28.610 --> 05:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
reading dyslexia
 
05:54:31.368 --> 05:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
um screening of that the assessments for
 
05:54:35.990 --> 05:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that and we see the need for this and a
 
05:54:38.990 --> 05:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
retained motion I think just puts it off
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
to no action until at least November
 
05:54:44.280 --> 05:54:45.110 align:start position:0%
to no action until at least November
um

05:54:45.110 --> 05:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:47.690 --> 05:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
however what I'd like to do and propose
 
05:54:49.970 --> 05:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
for everybody here is that we take we
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
stop our discussion right here and now
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
we have not taken any action we have a
 
05:54:59.090 --> 05:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
motion yes but we haven't taken action
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
we look at areas that we can put
 
05:55:05.330 --> 05:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
together a group that's really Dove
 
05:55:07.730 --> 05:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
wants to delve into this topic and we
 
05:55:10.730 --> 05:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
use this as the you know the carrier for
 
05:55:12.890 --> 05:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
you know amending or changing or
 
05:55:12.900 --> 05:55:13.850 align:start position:0%
you know amending or changing or
tweaking

05:55:13.850 --> 05:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
tweaking
 
05:55:17.208 --> 05:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
and moving forward with this bill by
 
05:55:19.730 --> 05:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
March 16th it's not an early bill so
 
05:55:22.070 --> 05:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's no rush for us to have to today
 
05:55:25.250 --> 05:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
get this thing done so we can get it
 
05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
recorded by next you know next week on
 
05:55:30.890 --> 05:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
on the 16th
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
I I think you know we we might be acting
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
in haste here one way the other and and
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
missing an opportunity
 
05:55:41.690 --> 05:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
so that that's the the suggestion I have
 
05:55:43.250 --> 05:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
what where are you on that
 
05:55:46.548 --> 05:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative Miler you agree so if we
 
05:55:49.730 --> 05:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
agree with that then that's uh and I
 
05:55:51.410 --> 05:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
said by the end today I'd try to have
 
05:55:53.030 --> 05:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of the subcommittees but I haven't
 
05:55:54.708 --> 05:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
had time to do that I will do that this
 
05:55:57.470 --> 05:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
evening and we we have a number of areas
 
05:55:59.930 --> 05:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
where we have to work on and come back
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
so uh and and do work by the either at
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
the end of there's one area couple which
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
we said by March 16th we just had
 
05:56:09.288 --> 05:56:09.298 align:start position:0%
another one on that and we have some
 
05:56:11.448 --> 05:56:11.458 align:start position:0%
others which we we have retained which
 
05:56:14.208 --> 05:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
we need to put committees together
 
05:56:16.490 --> 05:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
so with that I think we're done for
 
05:56:16.500 --> 05:56:18.110 align:start position:0%
so with that I think we're done for
today

05:56:18.110 --> 05:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:56:20.448 --> 05:56:20.458 align:start position:0%
it's formally recessing it
 
05:56:24.770 --> 05:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
um 377. yes so at this point in time we
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
are going to recess this bill and the
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
way we will address it is when we come
 
05:56:32.510 --> 05:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
back and want to do this after you know
 
05:56:35.150 --> 05:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
before prior to March uh 16 it will be
 
05:56:36.830 --> 05:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
put in a calendar under another exact
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
session so we'll just bring it up on
 
05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
that calendar at that time
 
05:56:44.628 --> 05:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
any comments or suggestions
 
05:56:46.788 --> 05:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank representative gagne
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
and representative Heath Heath for being
 
05:56:52.330 --> 05:56:52.340 align:start position:0%
here and joining our merry band here
 
05:56:55.670 --> 05:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may I have to say that it was
 
05:56:58.190 --> 05:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
very interesting that way out of my
 
05:57:01.070 --> 05:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
league way out I'm in criminal justice
 
05:57:03.530 --> 05:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
Transportation Veterans Affairs that's
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
okay but this when I was listening I
 
05:57:09.350 --> 05:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
learned a lot actually so it was a maybe
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know maybe I will broaden my
 
05:57:11.520 --> 05:57:13.448 align:start position:0%
you know maybe I will broaden my
horizons

05:57:13.448 --> 05:57:13.458 align:start position:0%
horizons
 
05:57:16.190 --> 05:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:57:19.850 --> 05:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
so with that we are adjourned I thank
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
